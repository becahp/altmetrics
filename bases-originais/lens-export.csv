Bowman; Fereshteh Didegah,"This paper measures social media activities of 15 broad scientific disciplines indexed in Scopus database using Altmetric.com data. First, the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database is investigated, overall and across disciplines. Second, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is used to determine the association of various factors with increasing or decreasing citations. Lastly, the effectiveness of altmetric indices to identify publications with high citation impact is comprehensively evaluated by deploying area under the curve (AUC)—an application of receiver operating characteristic. Results indicate a rapid increase in the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database from 10.19% in 2011 to 20.46% in 2015. It was found that Blog count was the most important factor in the field of Health Professions and Nursing as it increased the number of citations by 38.6%, followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field of Physics and Astronomy. The results of receiver operating characteristic show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC = 0.725 between highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings suggest that altmetrics can be used to distinguish highly cited publications. The implications of this research are significant in many different directions. Firstly, they set the basis for a further investigation of altmetrics efficiency to predict publications impact and most significantly promote new insights for the measurement of research outcome dissemination over social media.",113,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v113y2017i2d10.1007_s11192-017-2512-x.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2512-x http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1705.html#HassanIGAB17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2512-x,0,,10.1007/s11192-017-2512-x,2613734879,,005-278-577-590-526; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-418-270-613-554; 015-755-520-290-700; 040-761-208-292-979; 045-065-800-988-484; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-358-851-109-259; 050-849-594-689-761; 054-802-232-146-783; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-222-532-022-222; 066-507-313-507-599; 070-890-672-811-081; 072-463-767-991-704; 076-730-596-742-437; 099-816-321-816-355; 110-457-195-877-695; 117-472-869-381-363; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 123-687-398-098-005; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-098-062-346-311; 132-884-081-878-424; 139-651-430-124-012; 141-134-741-084-026; 159-262-940-665-026; 199-791-598-785-878,17

Citations from clinical trials records to academic research may therefore serve as an early warning of the likely future influence of the cited articles. This paper partially assesses this hypothesis by testing whether prior articles referenced in ClinicalTrials.gov records are more highly cited than average for the publishing journal. The results from four high profile general medical journals support the hypothesis, although there may not be a cause-and effect relationship. Nevertheless, it is reasonable for researchers to use citations to their work from clinical trials records as evidence of the possible long-term impact of their research.",109,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/77612708 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/sprscient/v_3a109_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a2_3ad_3a10.1007_5fs11192-016-2112-1.htm https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2112-1 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2112-1 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v109y2016i2d10.1007_s11192-016-2112-1.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/77612708.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2112-1,0,,10.1007/s11192-016-2112-1,2512252587,,007-781-992-937-68X; 013-525-736-972-288; 017-663-895-918-458; 021-456-501-520-58X; 027-591-182-413-436; 027-740-213-853-239; 028-593-154-415-675; 028-800-911-277-740; 031-655-750-122-27X; 032-416-874-702-75X; 035-988-212-620-838; 040-925-506-551-404; 040-935-572-159-071; 047-232-143-954-249; 047-864-759-001-054; 048-064-849-480-803; 054-016-914-748-353; 055-598-472-663-131; 056-296-901-258-429; 056-441-439-197-934; 057-974-586-524-171; 059-116-777-569-366; 063-582-602-927-582; 065-483-715-894-317; 066-507-313-507-599; 066-827-534-057-723; 067-430-635-688-437; 068-417-475-849-819; 070-724-432-178-041; 079-515-015-804-116; 082-869-393-502-808; 087-512-538-875-008; 090-078-202-500-308; 090-311-266-269-801; 090-952-955-262-779; 094-860-125-373-899; 106-598-824-898-46X; 107-032-556-023-774; 108-765-545-102-877; 119-261-929-311-15X; 120-155-307-250-272; 148-457-146-536-439; 149-086-710-081-997; 156-205-191-451-652,6

Today’s researchers exist in a very connected world, in which scholarly knowledge is rapidly published, disseminated and shared online amongst a global audience. They are communicating their research between each other and with the wider world, aiming to make an impact on society. Gathering evidence of this activity can provide powerful and data-driven insights into the reach and influence of specific content, which can then be utilised to help develop an individual’s professional reputation and build future strategy. Online tools such as Altmetric can collect and analyse this data, and present it in a way that makes sense to researchers and university administrators. In this session we’ll explore why the London School of Economics is supporting altmetrics as a priority for identifying impact. We will discuss the tools and workflows that make this effective and engaging for researchers, and enable a broad view of departments and the institution as a whole. We’ll have examples of how the information that the Altmetric Explorer collates can then be interpreted and incorporated into reporting, statements of impact and supplement the traditional metrics academics already use. You will also find out how LSE have used altmetric data to generate engagement between the library, research office and faculty. Altmetrics can provide the data for a story of how research is creating impact. At LSE the library is working with the research office, department heads and individual researchers to identify and interpret this data, combined with citation metrics to create an overall picture of the activities of the School and staff. In particular, we’ll focus on what benefits this brings both the institution as a whole, and the individual researcher. Attendees will leave the session with some practical tips for how they can begin to get familiar with such data themselves, and some ideas to help them consider how they might integrate similar practices within their own organisation.",,,,http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/SCS/article/view/3868/0,http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/5.3868,0,,10.7557/5.3868,2532540573,,,0

Most of the studies, however, have focused on the comparison of altemetric indicators with traditional citation metrics and few have explored the factors influencing altmetric performance. This study investigates the dissemination pattern of scientific articles on social medial, and is particularly focused on highly tweeted articles and highly cited articles. Based on bibliometric and altmetric data collected for over 40,000 articles in the field of biology, we found that the timing of tweets and the type of Twitter accounts affect the amount of attention that a scientific publication receives on social media. Articles with a large number of tweets tend to be the ones receiving immediate social media exposure and are often tweeted by journal associated organization accounts or other individual accounts with a large number of followers. By contrast, highly cited articles in general are neither tweeted timely nor promoted by their respective journal accounts.",117,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2876-6 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v117y2018i1d10.1007_s11192-018-2876-6.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2876-6,0,,10.1007/s11192-018-2876-6,2884469698,,002-226-601-796-708; 012-687-178-527-213; 015-586-822-938-491; 019-095-023-586-281; 020-514-860-160-869; 023-271-041-203-090; 035-964-848-340-165; 037-232-986-091-282; 039-505-270-645-642; 040-761-208-292-979; 042-960-490-465-267; 049-416-575-390-503; 050-478-932-954-469; 050-886-092-294-893; 054-178-855-505-010; 054-802-232-146-783; 055-831-901-562-709; 056-441-439-197-934; 057-216-673-497-72X; 057-286-311-076-534; 066-507-313-507-599; 066-827-534-057-723; 067-045-483-731-561; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-267-966-095-209; 082-680-870-743-518; 083-709-760-547-965; 085-059-887-752-086; 089-914-448-038-331; 093-996-586-975-725; 100-132-652-263-480; 112-388-610-249-693; 122-353-860-287-425; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-532-668-707-301; 130-446-333-613-121; 148-732-455-349-016; 154-588-960-181-561; 169-829-696-386-902; 190-354-270-023-607,3

Surveys show researchers are interested in open access publishing, but some researchers perceive that there is a lack of quality journals offering open access. However, a number of established publishers have recently launched fully open access journals for political and social scientists, such as Palgrave Communications and Research & Politics.

Along with traditional metrics of research quality, such as citation counts, online images of researchers and institutions increasingly matter in evaluating academic impact, decisions about grant allocation, and promotion. We examined 400 biographical Wikipedia articles on academics from four scientific fields to test if being featured in the world’s largest online encyclopedia is correlated with higher academic notability (assessed through citation counts). We found no statistically significant correlation between Wikipedia articles metrics (length, number of edits, number of incoming links from other articles, etc.) and academic notability of the mentioned researchers. We also did not find any evidence that the scientists with better WP representation are necessarily more prominent in their fields. In addition, we inspected the Wikipedia coverage of notable scientists sampled from Thomson Reuters list of ‘highly cited researchers’. In each of the examined fields, Wikipedia failed in covering notable scholars properly. Both findings imply that Wikipedia might be producing an inaccurate image of academics on the front end of science.

The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach – In this work the attempt is made to indicate the relevance of the Leiden manifesto for altmetrics. Findings – As shown by the discussion of the ten principles against the background of the knowledge about and the research into altmetrics, the principles also have a great importance for altmetrics and should be taken into account in their application. Originality/value – Altmetrics is already frequently used in the area of research evaluation.

Block; Philippe E. Rolshausen; Dario Cantu,"Trunk diseases create tremendous problems for the viticulture industry causing significant economical losses due to reduced yields, increased crop management costs for cultural and chemical preventive measures, and shortened life span of the vines (Munkvold et al., 1994; Bertsch et al., 2013). No cures are currently available and the diseased wood is typically removed to limit the spread of infection to other permanent structures of the vine. Knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the development of these diseases is still limited. Recent advancements in genome sequencing technologies (so-called, Next Generation Sequencing) allow us to quickly catalog the entire repertoire of virulence functions of a plant pathogen, a rapid acquisition of a huge amount of information for organisms that were previously uncharacterized. We have recently released the draft genome sequences of pathogens associated with three major trunk diseases of grapevine: esca dieback (Phaeoacremonium aleophilum), botryosphaeria dieback (Neofusicoccum parvum), and eutypa dieback (Eutypa lata). All data, including the raw sequencing data, have been deposited in public databases (GenBank WGS and SRA archives) and are also hosted on the Cantu Lab website (http://cantulab.github.com). The data is freely available to anybody with no restrictions. Sequencing, assembly and preliminary genomic analyses are described in the journal Genome Announcements published by the American Society of Microbiology (Blanco-Ulate et al., 2013a,b,c). These one-page reports provide scientists that want to use the genomic information with details on the pathogen strains sequenced and how the sequencing and assembly were performed. With the exception of the genome of Botrytis cinerea (Amselem et al., 2011) the fungal agent of bunch rot, to our knowledge these are the first genomes of fungal grape pathogens publicly available. Updates to the current genome versions will be readily shared through the Cantu lab website hosted by GitHub (http://github.com), which will also provide a centralized repository for bioinformatic scripts and pipelines used in the genome analyses. The availability of newer versions will be communicated through Twitter (@CantuLab), or any social media that is widely used. By sharing these novel genomic sequences through rapid public release, we hope to stimulate research/scientific crowdsourcing to understand how these destructive pathogens cause disease, reducing grapevine yield and lifespan. This aggregation of talent and complementary expertise, with no need to initiate formal collaborations, will significantly reduce the time needed to solve these critical viticulture problems. We also hope that our openness will help promote the more collaborative model of scientific approach.",4,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/104730280 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3788621/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3788621 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2013.00394/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82861680.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2013.00394,0,24106495,10.3389/fpls.2013.00394,2166470563,PMC3788621,004-738-667-108-842; 011-054-629-780-490; 011-288-383-925-873; 013-417-030-567-59X; 023-559-449-721-601; 030-492-913-868-00X; 037-713-870-680-680; 039-472-468-129-469; 041-424-414-564-68X; 057-869-659-844-295; 067-630-372-124-491; 067-768-442-470-261; 083-142-630-090-528; 085-678-459-093-048; 111-339-748-064-950; 111-474-996-731-865; 124-306-656-178-484; 167-776-073-241-628; 191-340-649-331-97X,3

An empirical test of the convergent validity of altmetrics based on data from the UK research excellence framework (REF),Empirical research; Convergent validity; Data mining; Bibliometrics; Data science; Altmetrics; Citation; Research Excellence Framework; Computer science; News media; Societal impact of nanotechnology,2019-02-01,2019,journal article,,,1,325,340,Lutz Bornmann; Robin Haunschild; Jonathan Adams,"Abstract Altmetrics have been proposed as a way to assess the societal impact of research. Although altmetrics are already in use as impact or attention metrics in different contexts, it is still not clear whether they really capture or reflect societal impact. This study is based on altmetrics, citation counts, research output and case study data from the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF), and peers’ REF assessments of research output and societal impact. We investigated the convergent validity of altmetrics by using two REF datasets: publications submitted as research output (PRO) to the REF and publications referenced in case studies (PCS). Case studies, which are intended to demonstrate societal impact, should cite the most relevant research papers. We used the MHq’ indicator for assessing impact – an indicator which has been introduced for count data with many zeros. The results of the first part of the analysis show that news media as well as mentions on Facebook, in blogs, in Wikipedia, and in policy-related documents have higher MHq’ values for PCS than for PRO. Thus, the altmetric indicators seem to have convergent validity for these data. In the second part of the analysis, altmetrics have been correlated with REF reviewers’ average scores on PCS. The negative or close to zero correlations question the convergent validity of altmetrics in that context. We suggest that they may capture a different aspect of societal impact (which can be called unknown attention) to that seen by reviewers (who are interested in the causal link between research and action in society).",13,,,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1807.03977 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v13y2019i1p325-340.html https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2019.01.008 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157718302700 https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03977 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2019.01.008,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2019.01.008,2896826974,,001-214-034-082-068; 001-976-473-572-537; 002-539-370-032-23X; 002-587-330-862-649; 003-075-869-802-612; 003-677-197-666-264; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-278-577-590-526; 005-969-100-665-44X; 006-877-571-611-120; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-206-247-539-230; 010-418-270-613-554; 010-474-157-259-115; 012-717-760-048-191; 013-930-130-018-413; 014-173-572-776-423; 015-755-520-290-700; 015-828-855-411-513; 016-948-465-445-016; 018-439-684-800-564; 019-095-023-586-281; 020-431-920-348-684; 021-053-357-181-053; 021-120-673-715-990; 022-815-023-314-850; 024-704-447-017-762; 025-704-627-779-867; 026-365-650-771-727; 028-354-796-369-887; 030-618-222-754-098; 030-964-160-765-008; 031-573-067-523-731; 033-072-382-098-269; 033-518-090-321-581; 035-678-282-600-695; 037-306-820-743-518; 038-904-999-660-101; 039-090-602-197-064; 040-332-014-369-098; 041-046-227-450-542; 041-115-886-503-843; 042-120-011-270-12X; 043-386-754-621-351; 048-848-146-953-411; 049-416-575-390-503; 049-905-673-769-223; 052-129-828-982-897; 052-165-950-513-769; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 061-575-716-156-028; 062-582-124-650-075; 064-778-162-089-714; 065-999-358-109-903; 066-187-389-040-171; 072-463-767-991-704; 073-888-514-999-599; 075-751-303-826-167; 080-120-317-309-996; 082-207-674-261-593; 085-573-871-761-262; 090-741-145-756-363; 090-958-442-251-078; 093-664-234-944-828; 095-661-194-276-886; 098-446-719-249-299; 103-455-013-608-951; 104-564-886-567-465; 105-123-915-796-164; 110-457-195-877-695; 120-870-232-770-910; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 128-827-839-130-108; 132-169-071-216-547; 135-884-653-956-432; 139-029-360-815-01X; 149-808-639-989-493; 150-070-576-398-617; 150-325-162-873-23X; 150-611-071-696-175; 151-302-425-499-476; 156-904-716-291-384; 159-843-129-711-033; 161-092-247-791-596; 174-532-146-943-325; 178-986-919-421-302,9

We investigate if cited research data ""impacts"" the (social) web, reflected by altmetrics scores, and if there is any relationship between the number of citations and the sum of altmetrics scores from various social media platforms. Three tools are used to collect altmetrics scores, namely PlumX, ImpactStory, and Altmetric.com, and the corresponding results are compared. We found that out of the three altmetrics tools, PlumX has the best coverage. Our experiments revealed that research data remain mostly uncited (about 85 %), although there has been an increase in citing data sets published since 2008. The percentage of the number of cited research data with a DOI in DCI has decreased in the last years. Only nine repositories are responsible for research data with DOIs and two or more citations. The number of cited research data with altmetrics ""foot-prints"" is even lower (4---9 %) but shows a higher coverage of research data from the last decade. In our study, we also found no correlation between the number of citations and the total number of altmetrics scores. Yet, certain data types (i.e. survey, aggregate data, and sequence data) are more often cited and also receive higher altmetrics scores. Additionally, we performed citation and altmetric analyses of all research data published between 2011 and 2013 in four different disciplines covered by the DCI. In general, these results correspond very well with the ones obtained for research data cited at least twice and also show low numbers in citations and in altmetrics. Finally, we observed that there are disciplinary differences in the availability and extent of altmetrics scores.",107,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v107y2016i2d10.1007_s11192-016-1887-4.html http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1887-4 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1887-4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4833815/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-1887-4 https://core.ac.uk/display/81897189 https://paperity.org/p/75396902/research-data-explored-an-extended-analysis-of-citations-and-altmetrics https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11192-016-1887-4.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1887-4 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81897189.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1887-4,0,27122647,10.1007/s11192-016-1887-4,2274116681,PMC4833815,000-785-692-812-344; 006-183-761-993-653; 043-754-919-265-460; 055-788-708-180-492; 060-713-609-759-751; 061-423-295-951-775; 063-144-189-164-648; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-897-343-637-16X; 072-463-767-991-704; 073-368-464-522-856; 074-614-949-934-346; 077-727-195-189-342; 083-147-550-827-377; 096-114-458-945-160; 098-902-200-743-078; 102-425-329-167-44X; 122-073-156-920-876; 130-446-333-613-121; 150-106-942-587-883; 164-892-622-720-656,44

S. Cavadas; Katherine A. Owen,"The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ""COT drives resistance to RAF inhibition through MAPK pathway reactivation"" by Johannessen and colleagues, published in Nature in 2010 (Johannessen et al., 2010). The key experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3B, 3D-E, 3I, and 4E-F. In Figures 3B, D-E, RPMI-7951 and OUMS023 cells were reported to exhibit robust ERK/MEK activity concomitant with reduced growth sensitivity in the presence of the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. MAP3K8 (COT/TPL2) directly regulated MEK/ERK phosphorylation, as the treatment of RPMI-7951 cells with a MAP3K8 kinase inhibitor resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of MEK/ERK activity (Figure 3I). In contrast, MAP3K8-deficient A375 cells remained sensitive to BRAF inhibition, exhibiting reduced growth and MEK/ERK activity during inhibitor treatment. To determine if RAF and MEK inhibitors together can overcome single-agent resistance, MAP3K8-expressing A375 cells treated with PLX4720 along with MEK inhibitors significantly inhibited both cell viability and ERK activation compared to treatment with PLX4720 alone, as reported in Figures 4E-F. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.",5,"Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/metabolism","Proto-Oncogene Proteins; BRAF protein, human; Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf; MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases; MAP3K8 protein, human",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26999821 https://elifesciences.org/articles/11414 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4811761/,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.11414,0,26999821,10.7554/elife.11414,2332850103,PMC4811761,003-354-515-396-057; 012-452-195-641-337; 018-704-481-246-756; 018-938-009-319-271; 020-878-320-228-815; 021-550-554-953-224; 025-866-155-986-391; 032-049-177-406-929; 032-495-583-839-033; 033-350-619-518-290; 041-982-347-633-935; 043-767-730-423-763; 047-133-887-621-216; 047-862-301-655-794; 047-941-980-727-168; 051-181-384-611-05X; 051-425-933-870-758; 058-131-907-048-980; 059-649-516-981-004; 081-271-724-549-676; 084-741-977-334-713; 085-935-972-165-06X; 131-969-074-107-791; 132-302-628-944-657; 150-325-162-873-23X,4

For each field, lists of Spanish and UK journal articles published in the year 2012 and their citation counts were extracted from Scopus. The software Webometric Analyst was then used to extract a range of altmetrics for these articles, including patent citations, online presentation mentions, online course syllabus mentions, Wikipedia mentions and Mendeley reader counts and Altmetric.com was used to extract Twitter mentions. Results show that Mendeley is the altmetric source with the highest coverage, with 80 % of sampled articles having one or more Mendeley readers, followed by Twitter (34 %). The coverage of the remaining sources was lower than 3 %. All of the indicators checked either have too little data or increase the overall difference between Spain and the UK and so none can be suggested as alternatives to reduce the bias against Spain in traditional citation indexes.",109,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/77612711 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2118-8 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v109y2016i3d10.1007_s11192-016-2118-8.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2118-8 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3023207,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2118-8,0,,10.1007/s11192-016-2118-8,2515889430,,002-064-950-420-419; 002-666-995-736-984; 003-168-179-893-142; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-011-849-467-618; 005-978-375-792-59X; 006-852-842-690-836; 008-094-244-126-752; 009-865-709-406-084; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-141-385-349-31X; 012-717-760-048-191; 016-075-957-665-082; 016-872-058-578-729; 017-663-895-918-458; 018-463-957-698-068; 019-265-590-591-246; 019-590-944-988-347; 019-658-209-137-261; 019-892-675-792-736; 020-525-285-809-839; 021-696-172-742-263; 022-783-973-655-305; 023-271-041-203-090; 025-103-400-252-362; 025-134-419-467-349; 026-052-027-802-221; 028-301-166-810-034; 028-593-154-415-675; 030-618-222-754-098; 030-813-306-347-91X; 032-114-706-877-872; 032-858-825-665-444; 035-123-753-214-354; 035-988-212-620-838; 036-929-472-363-934; 037-400-773-374-836; 038-645-901-974-708; 038-820-994-669-803; 040-452-112-976-920; 042-120-011-270-12X; 042-941-479-981-304; 044-015-166-497-802; 044-959-160-435-748; 045-538-349-555-146; 045-685-546-363-338; 049-012-192-454-37X; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-744-930-738-219; 051-257-819-274-872; 054-765-595-496-387; 055-808-236-401-052; 056-790-947-087-593; 059-613-508-373-557; 060-300-352-015-793; 060-647-054-175-919; 064-162-089-537-051; 064-509-241-094-364; 064-892-052-714-303; 066-058-608-660-901; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-704-690-865-884; 068-636-673-224-780; 069-677-360-377-433; 070-957-766-262-099; 072-150-692-543-669; 072-463-767-991-704; 073-189-236-490-721; 073-628-617-778-798; 075-127-246-395-778; 075-455-963-596-858; 076-399-144-464-512; 079-125-689-777-042; 079-343-312-870-007; 084-052-152-768-88X; 084-439-264-040-646; 084-516-954-138-233; 085-228-177-458-717; 088-597-447-059-605; 090-539-224-982-001; 090-958-442-251-078; 092-547-451-369-402; 094-058-984-441-978; 095-383-957-236-237; 099-816-321-816-355; 101-889-143-601-454; 102-276-478-923-871; 104-094-811-001-973; 106-726-675-213-300; 109-328-246-156-69X; 110-457-195-877-695; 111-263-758-865-884; 114-569-399-530-919; 116-004-210-033-746; 116-120-428-459-270; 120-155-307-250-272; 121-011-195-507-937; 126-062-861-008-278; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 132-218-905-671-078; 135-407-379-480-977; 138-732-872-483-934; 139-651-430-124-012; 142-998-031-987-962; 143-804-082-399-413; 152-370-884-887-022; 154-624-043-536-340; 154-852-458-715-476; 160-185-035-790-168; 170-574-518-923-393; 170-943-882-378-660; 185-099-554-359-448; 189-415-974-649-924; 192-643-391-387-427; 196-459-228-856-452,16

The top 20 papers in our analysis covered a variety of topics, mainly new disease mechanisms, treatment options and risk factors for the development of PD. The main media sources for these high attention papers were news items and Twitter. The papers were published predominantly in high impact journals, suggesting a correlation between altmetrics and conventional metrics. One paper published in a relatively modest journal received a significant amount of attention, reflecting that public attention does not always parallel the traditional metrics.

Lewis,"BackgroundThe Hirsch index, often used to assess research impact, suffers from questionable validity within the context of General Surgery, and consequently adapted bibliometrics and altmetrics have emerged, including the r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index. This study aimed to assess the relative value of these novel bibliometrics in a single UK Deanery General Surgical Consultant cohort.MethodFive indices (h, r, m, g and i10) and altmetric scores (AS) were calculated for 151 general surgical consultants in a UK Deanery. Indices and AS were calculated from publication data via the Scopus search engine with assessment of construct validity and reliability.ResultsThe median number of publications, h-index, r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index were 13 (range 0–389), 5 (range 0–63), 5.2 (range 0–64.8), 0.33 (range 0–1.5), 10 (range 0–125) and 4 (range 0–245), respectively. Correlation coefficients of r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index with h-index were 0.913 (p < 0.001), 0.716 (p < 0.001), 0.961 (p < 0.001) and 0.939 (p < 0.001), respectively. Significant variance was observed when the cohort was ranked by individual bibliometric measures; the median ranking shifts were: r-index − 2 (− 46 to + 23); m-index − 6.5 (− 53 to + 22); g-index − 0.5 (− 24 to + 13); and i10-index 0 (− 8 to + 11), respectively (p < 0.001). The median altmetric score and AS index were 0 (range 0–225.5) and 1 (range 0–10), respectively; AS index correlated strongly with h-index (correlation coefficient 0.390, p < 0.001).ConclusionsAdapted bibliometric indices appear to be equally valid measures of evaluating academic productivity, impact and reach.",43,"Bibliometrics; Consultants; Publications/statistics & numerical data; Reproducibility of Results; Specialties, Surgical/statistics & numerical data",,http://orca.cf.ac.uk/120387/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00268-018-04893-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00268-018-04893-w,0,30564922,10.1007/s00268-018-04893-w,2903735087,,005-219-507-701-892; 017-932-190-446-959; 019-009-877-753-334; 019-291-975-449-063; 024-836-790-992-420; 029-420-167-353-195; 035-334-852-173-711; 037-364-328-354-647; 040-677-095-383-388; 056-426-226-149-95X; 057-967-017-369-022; 063-532-277-943-208; 066-566-353-286-399; 071-878-836-294-733; 101-752-490-869-458; 107-265-025-742-267; 127-478-071-177-443; 138-561-175-358-392; 145-920-306-547-931; 172-132-667-730-557,1

The term influmetrics is proposed as a better term for altmetrics. The importance of considering research products and not just scientific publications is highlighted. Issues related to peer review and making funding decisions within a multi-metric approach are discussed and brought in relation with the new metrics field.,58,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11434-013-5939-3.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11434-013-5939-3 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ChSBu..58.3288R/abstract https://paperity.org/p/34095610/a-multi-metric-approach-for-research-evaluation https://core.ac.uk/display/81757725 http://users.telenet.be/ronald.rousseau/altmetrics___influmetrics.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81757725.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-5939-3,0,,10.1007/s11434-013-5939-3,1997215510,,001-409-541-141-130; 012-541-098-811-124; 018-082-966-584-653; 020-749-054-636-988; 023-595-621-355-526; 026-406-955-923-179; 033-887-521-052-015; 044-939-394-642-346; 044-959-160-435-748; 046-533-626-365-708; 046-870-311-216-086; 050-620-415-061-78X; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-548-921-979-744; 063-789-423-782-849; 065-245-962-018-222; 086-809-706-245-39X; 093-692-438-358-255; 099-816-321-816-355; 110-580-969-132-595; 124-490-028-694-122; 146-733-369-353-088; 148-482-941-796-330; 171-871-209-971-911; 198-484-010-634-491,39

We undertake a qualitative case study of six individuals who implemented disruptive and transformative pedagogical approaches and curricular practices in their departments and/or at their institutions. Our findings point to six common characteristics – motivation to change institutionalized practices, interest in change, experience in the field, multi-embeddedness, authority to act, and the strategic use of social networks – which seem to play a role at individual levels in driving these disruptive and transformative approaches. While acknowledging studies in higher education that address innovation as a response to exogenous influences, this study highlights the role of individuals with certain characteristics in driving innovation and processes of endogenous change in higher education institutions.

Sloan Foundation,4,e0175368,,Qing Ke; Yong-Yeol Ahn; Cassidy R. Sugimoto,"Metrics derived from Twitter and other social media—often referred to as altmetrics—are increasingly used to estimate the broader social impacts of scholarship. Such efforts, however, may produce highly misleading results, as the entities that participate in conversations about science on these platforms are largely unknown. For instance, if altmetric activities are generated mainly by scientists, does it really capture broader social impacts of science? Here we present a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing scientists on Twitter. Our method can identify scientists across many disciplines, without relying on external bibliographic data, and be easily adapted to identify other stakeholder groups in science. We investigate the demographics, sharing behaviors, and interconnectivity of the identified scientists. We find that Twitter has been employed by scholars across the disciplinary spectrum, with an over-representation of social and computer and information scientists; under-representation of mathematical, physical, and life scientists; and a better representation of women compared to scholarly publishing. Analysis of the sharing of URLs reveals a distinct imprint of scholarly sites, yet only a small fraction of shared URLs are science-related. We find an assortative mixing with respect to disciplines in the networks between scientists, suggesting the maintenance of disciplinary walls in social media. Our work contributes to the literature both methodologically and conceptually—we provide new methods for disambiguating and identifying particular actors on social media and describing the behaviors of scientists, thus providing foundational information for the construction and use of indicators on the basis of social media metrics.",12,Humans; Science; Social Media; Workforce,,https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1608.06229 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175368 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5388341 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28399145 https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06229 http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175368 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06229 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1608.06229 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1275368K/abstract http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1608.html#KeAS16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175368,0,28399145,10.1371/journal.pone.0175368,2512532497,,001-613-225-506-503; 007-587-701-465-16X; 009-313-180-544-982; 010-141-385-349-31X; 012-399-872-558-240; 017-873-663-651-470; 019-457-587-825-722; 020-972-605-906-22X; 021-120-673-715-990; 026-052-027-802-221; 027-845-295-187-970; 030-233-311-444-30X; 040-252-626-797-747; 040-452-112-976-920; 047-188-502-443-622; 049-165-020-087-240; 050-252-270-491-60X; 053-329-372-985-557; 053-658-152-591-502; 056-415-226-776-693; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-222-532-022-222; 060-967-413-738-959; 066-507-313-507-599; 071-349-629-555-001; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-588-203-167-902; 097-785-082-928-488; 100-862-411-425-084; 101-639-433-985-394; 102-276-478-923-871; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-748-953-690-447; 126-062-861-008-278; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 139-651-430-124-012; 141-134-741-084-026; 150-113-445-118-088; 179-223-065-594-04X,38

We also investigated changes in altmetric activity over time and the characteristics of papers with the highest Twitter and Mendeley activity. The sample included 390 papers collected from the bibliographic database Scopus. Their altmetric and citation activities were measured at three time points: in July 2014, 2015, and 2016. The findings generally correspond to those observed in the large-scale studies of medical papers. Papers in renowned journals, and papers reporting clinical guidelines and multicentric studies had the most intense altmetric activity. In contrast, papers published in local, Croatian journals showed minimal altmetric activity, especially the papers published in Croatian. These results indicate that the local publishing community has not yet recognised social media as a tool for promoting research and that non-English language publications have minimal chances to receive attention, even in social media.

Methods: We screened 140 patients with acute, first-ever traumatic brain injury of any severity and included 60 patients for prospective follow-up examinations. Patients with prior brain trauma, other neurologic or systemic disease, drug abuse, or psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. Eighteen months after trauma, we performed detailed sleep assessment in 31 participants. As a control group, we enrolled healthy individuals without prior brain trauma matched for age, sex, and sleep satiation. Results: In the chronic state after traumatic brain injury, sleep need per 24 hours was persistently increased in trauma patients (8.1 ± 0.5 hours) as compared to healthy controls (7.1 ± 0.7 hours). The prevalence of chronic objective excessive daytime sleepiness was 67% in patients with brain trauma compared to 19% in controls. Patients significantly underestimated excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep need, emphasizing the unreliability of self-assessments on SWD in trauma patients. Conclusions: This study provides prospective, controlled, and objective evidence for chronic persistence of posttraumatic SWD, which remain underestimated by patients. These results have clinical and medicolegal implications given that SWD can exacerbate other outcomes of traumatic brain injury, impair quality of life, and are associated with public safety hazards.",86,"Actigraphy; Adult; Brain Injuries, Traumatic/complications; Delta Rhythm; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Polysomnography; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis; Time Factors",,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/127632/1/Sleep-wake_Publikation.pdf http://n.neurology.org/content/early/2016/04/27/WNL.0000000000002697 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164676 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/127632/ https://boris.unibe.ch/84379/ http://www.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000002697 https://n.neurology.org/content/86/21/1945 http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/127632/1/Sleep-wake_Publikation.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002697,0,27164676,10.1212/wnl.0000000000002697,2345036693,,004-228-899-355-965; 010-931-431-864-600; 011-953-001-751-589; 012-090-810-113-902; 014-061-231-225-272; 022-053-430-971-489; 026-006-016-660-486; 026-213-764-474-082; 033-994-094-579-587; 041-897-778-891-083; 048-683-422-468-592; 054-252-609-869-225; 072-683-722-427-725; 075-281-229-259-358; 076-770-592-025-138; 095-381-398-710-692; 127-580-204-976-769,31

These metrics describe the impact of traditional venues (i.e. scholarly journals) as well as the impact of the scholars based on the number of times their work has been cited in traditional and nontraditional venues. Academic librarians assist faculty in explaining their impact and productivity in their respective fields in part through information published to their websites. Terms/concepts associated with common metrics relating to scholarly impact were searched in the library websites of the 62 Association of American University (AAU) members. A total of 61 libraries had web pages or LibGuides providing information on these topics, with Journal Citation Reports and the Impact Factor being the most commonly discussed (100%; 98.4%). Slightly over 90% (90.2%) supplied information about the h-index and 80.3% addressed altmetrics.

Dual-map overlays of journals show that the knowledge base of IS research has shifted considerably since 2010, with emerging topics including scientific evaluation indicators, altmetrics, science mapping and visualization, bibliometrics, citation analysis, and scientific collaboration.",115,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2695-9 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:scient:v:115:y:2018:i:2:d:10.1007_s11192-018-2695-9 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v115y2018i2d10.1007_s11192-018-2695-9.html https://yonsei.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/emerging-trends-and-new-developments-in-information-science-a-doc,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2695-9,0,,10.1007/s11192-018-2695-9,2791050802,,000-518-481-975-315; 001-226-779-034-085; 001-540-504-849-133; 002-052-422-936-00X; 003-075-869-802-612; 003-078-576-803-447; 003-258-674-238-988; 003-551-054-619-694; 003-863-694-314-744; 003-868-747-830-164; 005-893-127-733-440; 006-461-237-333-939; 008-504-873-279-953; 009-303-522-533-513; 009-905-331-176-101; 010-205-233-948-401; 010-387-674-493-027; 010-413-045-759-853; 011-364-541-838-073; 011-406-809-904-514; 017-349-318-774-487; 018-136-835-958-644; 019-641-580-320-959; 021-141-569-633-568; 021-541-946-592-128; 022-246-180-004-832; 023-487-642-285-020; 025-357-600-804-272; 025-384-616-911-797; 026-391-452-599-662; 028-954-279-556-819; 029-420-167-353-195; 030-671-248-846-321; 032-437-995-253-850; 032-814-495-884-104; 032-858-825-665-444; 035-082-099-109-112; 036-270-770-292-051; 036-506-743-825-72X; 036-656-168-693-890; 036-699-564-262-371; 037-326-531-131-863; 039-042-867-650-059; 041-433-647-401-042; 042-422-237-325-211; 042-424-826-222-674; 044-334-096-634-776; 044-414-307-587-237; 045-949-120-133-267; 049-217-541-141-304; 049-758-553-880-253; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-620-415-061-78X; 050-719-220-759-782; 061-877-295-914-153; 064-400-499-357-900; 064-482-912-103-288; 066-507-313-507-599; 069-511-868-544-95X; 072-610-779-757-007; 075-227-805-962-707; 077-261-180-048-537; 077-721-728-193-436; 078-762-062-751-821; 085-211-231-477-329; 087-622-694-187-415; 093-355-302-681-101; 094-393-232-914-996; 099-814-315-081-824; 099-816-321-816-355; 101-486-881-591-183; 102-985-858-003-729; 103-268-627-372-687; 105-292-413-767-993; 105-402-220-957-576; 110-921-167-795-98X; 111-531-383-476-599; 114-804-057-176-54X; 115-207-974-449-139; 120-031-301-873-562; 120-976-068-591-069; 128-127-351-140-719; 128-518-301-677-700; 134-961-673-705-833; 137-095-701-557-26X; 143-804-082-399-413; 152-370-884-887-022; 154-031-573-618-251; 156-415-541-949-588; 156-907-589-856-699; 160-732-458-223-974; 182-803-647-408-170,15

The overall correlation between Mendeley readership counts and citations for the social sciences was higher than for the humanities. Low and medium correlations between Mendeley bookmarks and citation counts in all the investigated disciplines suggest that these measures reflect different aspects of research impact. Mendeley data were also used to discover patterns of information flow between scientific fields. Comparing information flows based on Mendeley bookmarking data and cross-disciplinary citation analysis for the disciplines revealed substantial similarities and some differences. Thus, the evidence from this study suggests that Mendeley readership data could be used to help capture knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines, especially for people that read but do not author articles, as well as giving impact evidence at an earlier stage than is possible with citation counts.",65,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jinfst/v65y2014i8p1627-1638.html https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23071 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.23071 https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.23071,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23071,0,,10.1002/asi.23071,1531607676,,000-792-009-951-071; 002-402-462-805-44X; 002-541-304-332-19X; 002-885-973-223-088; 005-531-363-623-587; 005-863-492-829-101; 006-018-730-429-356; 006-599-964-569-114; 007-298-475-447-463; 008-524-147-916-100; 010-057-293-861-47X; 011-988-262-562-591; 015-700-245-441-595; 016-096-565-207-552; 018-590-173-884-235; 020-647-409-662-919; 021-583-223-393-016; 028-977-423-709-739; 029-178-733-078-317; 032-003-992-083-579; 036-691-688-629-570; 040-754-546-913-138; 044-466-446-065-230; 044-959-160-435-748; 045-826-216-154-863; 050-252-270-491-60X; 054-062-498-731-17X; 064-958-957-312-199; 071-615-277-709-925; 081-870-725-655-117; 081-990-658-844-335; 082-268-501-475-090; 082-502-990-688-347; 086-378-586-069-448; 086-809-706-245-39X; 089-914-448-038-331; 094-408-168-535-826; 099-816-321-816-355; 104-180-733-697-768; 104-471-540-857-665; 107-076-706-098-822; 107-362-817-191-656; 123-687-398-098-005; 129-098-062-346-311; 132-910-581-404-766; 141-134-741-084-026; 143-804-082-399-413; 151-522-419-975-100; 163-595-480-871-354; 167-017-593-692-812; 167-479-548-133-604; 170-945-253-335-587; 177-787-582-091-521; 184-770-421-976-428,147

Piwowar; Jason Priem,"If scholarly communication is broken, how will we fix it? At Impactstory—a non-profit devoted to helping scholars gather and share evidence of their research impact by tracking online usage of scholarship via blogs, Wikipedia, Mendeley, and more—we believe that incentivizing web-native research via altmetrics is the place to start. In this article, we describe the current state of the art in altmetrics and its effects on publishing, we share Impactstory’s plan to build an open infrastructure for altmetrics, and describe our company’s ethos and actions. “Scholarly communication is broken.” We’ve heard this refrain for close to twenty years now, but what does it mean? Academic publishing is still mostly a slow, arduous, and closed process. Researchers have little incentive to experiment with new forms of scholarly communication or make their research freely available at the speed of science, since they’re mainly recognized for publishing journal articles and books: a narrow, very traditional form of scholarly impact. Most arguments attribute academic publishing’s problems to a system that benefits corporate interests or to perverse incentives for tenure and promotion. The solution? Open up research and update our incentive systems accordingly. For too long now, academic publishing has relied on a closed infrastructure that was architected to serve commercial interests. Researchers who attempt to practice open science can find it difficult to get recognition for the impact of open access (OA) publications and research products beyond the journal article, products that include scientific software, data, and so on. Some have already imagined a better future for scholarly communication, one where OA is the norm and a new, open infrastructure serves the diverse needs of scholars throughout the research lifecycle. The decoupled journal is slowly becoming a reality, [1] [#N1] OA publications continue to gain a market share, [2] [#N2] and measuring impact of a diverse set of scholarly outputs through altmetrics is becoming an increasingly common practice for scholars. [3] [#N3] We founded Impactstory with this future in mind. Impactstory [http://impactstory.org] is a non-profit, open source web application that helps researchers gather, understand, and share with others the impact of all their scholarly outputs. We believe that Impactstory and other services that serve scholarly communication are essential to the future of academia. The Imperative for Open Altmetrics http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/idx/j/jep/3336451.0017.301/... 1 of 12 11/3/14, 9:06 PM In this article, we’ll describe the current state of the art in altmetrics and its effects on publishing, share our plan to build an open infrastructure for altmetrics, and describe our company’s ethos and actions. The current publishing ecosystem—and why it needs to be changed Altmetrics—sometimes called “alternative metrics” and defined by Priem, Piwowar, & Hemminger as social media-based metrics for scholarly works [4] [#N4] —are having a major effect on traditional scholarly publishing, but not for all of the reasons you might expect. Traditional academic publishers are masters of vertical integration. Once a manuscript is submitted to a traditional journal for publication, that journal coordinates peer-review, copy-edits, publishes, markets, manages copyright for, and provides scores of other services [5] [#N5] for the published article. In general, this system has done its job relatively well to date—publishing pay-to-read journals. But it has also resulted in a publishing ecosystem that can be harmful to scholars and the public [6] [#N6] : toll access journals with exorbitant subscription fees (as the for-profit publishers seek to expand their ever-widening profit margin [7] [#N7] ) and journal impact factors being used as a proxy for the quality of a published article when evaluating scholars’ work (not the fault of the publishers, to be sure, but they nonetheless contribute to the problem by promoting and sustaining JIF hype). What if we imagined a web-native publishing ecosystem that functioned in an open, networked manner, similar to how much research itself is conducted nowadays? What if we decoupled the services that many journals provide from the journal itself, and had scores of businesses that could provide many of the essential services that authors need, like peer-review, copy editing, marketing—with less overhead and greater transparency? Such a system has the opportunity to foster a scholarly communication environment that benefits scholars and the public, freeing the literature via Open Access publishing, improving the literature through open and post-publication peer review, and understanding the literature’s impact through article-level metrics and altmetrics. Luckily, that new system is in the process of being built. Every day, game-changing publishing services like Publons [https://publons.com/] and Rubriq [http://www.rubriq.com/] (stand-alone peer-review services [8] [#N8] ), Annotum [http://annotum.org/] and PressForward [http://pressforward.org/] (publishing platforms), Dryad [http://datadryad.org/] and Figshare [http://figshare.com/] (data-sharing platforms), and Kudos [https://www.growkudos.com/] (an article marketing service) are debuted. And altmetrics services like Impactstory [https://impactstory.org/] , Altmetric [http://www.altmetric.com/] , PlumX [https://plu.mx/] , and PLOS ALMs [http://article-levelmetrics.plos.org/] are also starting to be widely adopted, by both publishers and scholars alike. The rise of altmetrics Altmetrics are a solution to a problem that increasingly plagues scholars: even in situations where scholarship may be best served by a publishing a dataset, blog post, or other web-native scholarly product, one’s own career is often better served by instead putting that effort into traditional article-writing. If we want to move to a more efficient, web-native science, we must make that The Imperative for Open Altmetrics http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/idx/j/jep/3336451.0017.301/... 2 of 12 11/3/14, 9:06 PM dilemma disappear: what is good for scholarship must become good for the scholar. Instead of assessing only paper-native articles, books, and proceedings, we must build a new system where all types of scholarly products are evaluated and rewarded. The key to this new reward system is altmetrics: a broad suite of online impact indicators that goes beyond traditional citations to measure impacts of diverse products, in diverse platforms, on diverse groups of people. [9] [#N9] Altmetrics leverage the increasing centrality of the Web in scholarly communication, mining evidence of impact across a range of online tools and environments: [/j/jep/images/3336451.0017.301-00000001.jpg] These and other altmetrics promise to bridge the gap between the potential of web-native scholarship and the limitations of the paper-native scholarly reward system. A growing body of research supports the validity and potential usefulness of altmetrics. [10] [#N10] [11] [#N11] [12] [#N12] [13] [#N13] Eventually, these new metrics may power not only research evaluation, but also web-native filtering and recommendation tools. [14] [#N14] [15] [#N15] [16] [#N16] However, this vision of efficient, altmetrics-powered, and web-native scholarship will not occur accidentally. It requires advocacy to promote the value of altmetrics and web-native scholarship, online tools to demonstrate the immediate value of altmetrics as an assessment approach today, and an open data infrastructure to support developers as they create a new, web-native scholarly ecosystem.

Redundancy is another issue because the score is essentially driven by the number of citations and seems to bring negligible additional knowledge in the altmetrics landscape.",120,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-019-03124-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03124-w,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03124-w,2945596579,,000-008-780-383-23X; 000-422-367-255-529; 001-731-506-576-898; 001-757-928-198-829; 003-477-217-495-188; 003-483-061-209-94X; 005-808-575-904-822; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-418-270-613-554; 013-261-296-086-031; 014-144-058-523-949; 015-828-855-411-513; 019-457-587-825-722; 021-696-172-742-263; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-365-650-771-727; 026-768-258-304-258; 028-236-986-929-50X; 029-060-464-503-093; 029-165-255-951-763; 031-688-563-260-854; 031-698-222-071-181; 033-518-090-321-581; 034-658-158-500-326; 037-078-070-958-541; 037-082-280-557-203; 040-252-626-797-747; 041-648-733-693-182; 043-495-392-935-371; 046-423-437-082-437; 048-800-508-235-714; 049-316-012-536-347; 049-898-815-006-780; 050-096-417-464-322; 050-664-965-270-417; 050-827-362-481-681; 054-460-510-064-52X; 054-735-356-559-304; 055-197-819-525-25X; 055-430-689-149-505; 055-776-182-872-68X; 057-350-783-229-264; 061-381-101-824-418; 067-624-592-551-590; 069-169-184-648-685; 073-755-292-345-426; 075-267-966-095-209; 082-665-822-849-195; 083-195-681-917-731; 083-305-174-463-282; 086-602-022-821-597; 087-435-951-893-211; 093-664-234-944-828; 093-773-216-645-958; 093-861-925-204-733; 094-441-218-882-565; 095-943-309-957-821; 097-857-206-823-988; 101-517-725-082-255; 106-871-977-482-996; 109-328-246-156-69X; 113-470-699-649-018; 122-073-156-920-876; 124-100-639-504-029; 125-825-901-913-157; 130-317-360-512-157; 134-483-812-535-931; 138-072-668-440-274; 138-442-436-272-625; 149-040-025-444-303; 153-675-563-637-229; 168-249-553-236-707; 173-941-834-157-329; 177-327-044-796-682,0

We conducted efficacy and safety analyses on the basis of more than 10 years of follow-up in patients with CML who were treated with imatinib as initial therapy. MethodsIn this open-label, multicenter trial with crossover design, we randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase to receive either imatinib or interferon alfa plus cytarabine. Long-term analyses included overall survival, response to treatment, and serious adverse events. ResultsThe median follow-up was 10.9 years. Given the high rate of crossover among patients who had been randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine (65.6%) and the short duration of therapy before crossover in these patients (median, 0.8 years), the current analyses focused on patients who had been randomly assigned to receive imatinib.

Dudley,"The rapid growth of online tools to communicate scientific research raises the important question of whether online attention is associated with citations in the scholarly literature. The Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) quantifies the attention received by a scientific publication on various online platforms including news, blogs and social media. It has been advanced as a rapid way of gauging the impact of a piece of research, both in terms of potential future scholarly citations and wider online engagement. Here, we explore variation in the AAS of 2677 research articles published in 10 ornithological journals between 2012 and 2016. On average, AAS increased sevenfold in just five years, primarily due to increased activity on Twitter which contributed 75% of the total score. For a subset of 878 articles published in 2014, including an additional 323 ornithology articles from non-specialist journals, an increase in AAS from 1 to 20 resulted in a predicted 112% increase in citation count from 2.6 to 5.5 citations per article. This effect interacted with journal impact factor, with weaker effects of AAS in higher impact factor journals. Our results suggest that altmetrics (or the online activity they measure), as well as complementing traditional measures of scholarly impact in ornithology such as citations, may also anticipate or even drive them.",4,,,https://pure.uhi.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/tweeting-birds-online-mentions-predict-future-citations-in-ornithology(90174b0c-32b3-4c38-a9d3-4b6ebb9c7bc3).html http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/11/171371 https://pure.uhi.ac.uk/portal/files/2503131/171371.full.pdf https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.171371,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.171371,0,29291121,10.1098/rsos.171371,2766079223,,003-075-869-802-612; 005-278-577-590-526; 010-474-157-259-115; 011-652-559-317-774; 028-800-911-277-740; 029-054-339-138-305; 030-081-436-866-768; 036-761-880-244-33X; 040-252-626-797-747; 047-436-441-352-101; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-975-444-655-324; 054-802-232-146-783; 059-222-532-022-222; 063-263-384-459-531; 066-507-313-507-599; 071-629-435-717-021; 072-463-767-991-704; 073-933-359-768-204; 075-654-027-359-720; 076-730-596-742-437; 087-435-951-893-211; 090-602-655-587-782; 091-516-295-821-998; 103-199-876-285-449; 106-190-142-686-92X; 107-721-265-507-406; 112-099-238-670-789; 112-940-088-541-54X; 117-109-843-318-28X; 117-412-485-443-719; 122-353-860-287-425; 130-446-333-613-121; 139-651-430-124-012; 150-325-162-873-23X; 159-843-129-711-033; 167-275-555-617-549; 179-223-065-594-04X,9

Recent developments show a fundamental change in impact measurements from impact on science to impact on society. Since impact measurement is currently in a state of far reaching changes, this paper describes recent developments and facing problems in this area. For that, the results of key publications (dealing with impact measurement) are discussed. The paper discusses how impact is generally measured within science and beyond, which effects impact measurements have on the science system and which problems are associated with impact measurement. The problems associated with impact measurement constitute the focus of this paper: Science is marked by inequality, random chance, anomalies, the right to make mistakes, unpredictability and a high significance of extreme events, which might distort impact measurements. Scientometricians as the producer of impact scores and decision makers as their consumers should be aware of these problems and should consider them in the generation and interpretation of bibliometric results, respectively.",73,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10734-016-9995-x https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1138081 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10734-016-9995-x.pdf https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-016-9995-x https://paperity.org/p/75553060/measuring-impact-in-research-evaluations-a-thorough-discussion-of-methods-for-effects-of https://core.ac.uk/display/81775781 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81775781.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10734-016-9995-x,0,,10.1007/s10734-016-9995-x,792777101,,000-105-697-060-928; 000-325-487-647-207; 000-879-921-037-108; 001-828-909-480-971; 003-075-869-802-612; 003-677-197-666-264; 005-893-127-733-440; 006-821-576-705-676; 007-532-016-366-595; 007-781-992-937-68X; 007-840-581-278-875; 008-812-618-060-828; 008-847-257-141-525; 010-537-281-905-239; 010-985-966-961-419; 011-981-882-161-607; 013-161-679-400-931; 013-261-296-086-031; 014-701-472-060-424; 017-222-874-189-942; 017-646-649-847-434; 017-663-895-918-458; 019-095-023-586-281; 021-132-507-303-470; 028-590-640-553-674; 032-011-234-334-455; 033-072-382-098-269; 034-029-221-302-866; 037-331-683-577-73X; 037-444-528-921-466; 039-147-639-520-800; 040-174-898-422-964; 041-049-773-563-310; 041-679-153-033-294; 043-219-429-907-163; 047-232-143-954-249; 048-988-513-862-701; 049-416-575-390-503; 051-078-778-658-242; 051-471-653-993-486; 052-746-304-104-229; 054-733-728-692-052; 055-936-477-486-305; 056-593-281-338-022; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-074-194-744-131; 059-800-238-591-266; 062-900-501-797-218; 063-626-019-318-642; 067-012-534-259-439; 068-568-773-614-207; 071-747-555-461-929; 074-686-324-393-546; 075-261-739-394-13X; 079-866-764-920-565; 087-449-216-000-816; 087-945-386-404-840; 093-779-978-973-429; 095-699-839-731-115; 095-992-541-514-786; 099-348-677-096-630; 104-285-529-755-546; 115-592-057-241-190; 118-052-250-630-261; 122-353-860-287-425; 125-390-208-915-533; 126-062-861-008-278; 128-518-301-677-700; 132-238-138-313-349; 132-723-851-457-646; 135-034-903-596-45X; 144-993-186-683-816; 147-782-471-182-219; 150-070-576-398-617; 156-634-323-436-960; 156-904-716-291-384; 171-898-426-858-827; 177-842-166-898-931; 185-387-562-261-666; 190-470-648-543-566; 195-514-312-394-548; 197-307-872-013-134,32

Commentaries, news reports and editorials were excluded. By reading titles and abstracts, two authors carried out inclusion and exclusion of literature independently to exclude articles that are not related to orthodontics and retracted articles. Data extraction was performed simultaneously. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Linear regressions were used to analyze the association between Altmetric attention score (AAS) and potentially related factors. <b>Results:</b> Among 864 articles identified from PubMed, a total of 206 received an AAS, and 160 articles were included for analyzing. The mean AAS of orthodontic research articles from China was 2.7 (95% confidence interval: 2.0 to 3.4). <i>American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics</i> had the most scored articles (<i>n=</i>24) and the highest total AAS (67.0), while <i>European Journal of Orthodontics</i> had the highest mean AAS (3.8). All the top-3 articles were published in <i>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</i>. Significant positive associations were found among high impact factors (<i>P&lt;</i>0.05), high level of evidence (<i>P&lt;</i>0.001) and the AAS. <b>Conclusions:</b> Publishing more high-impact articles and high level of evidence articles improved the international social impact of orthodontic research from China.

Darroch; J.H. Green,"Abstract Universities and funders need robust metrics to help them develop and monitor evidence-based strategies. Metrics are a part, albeit an important part, of the evaluation landscape, and no single metric can paint a holistic picture or inform strategy. A “basket of metrics” alongside other evaluation methods such as peer review are needed. Snowball Metrics offer a robust framework for measuring research performance and related data exchange and analysis, providing a consistent approach to information and measurement between institutions, funders and government bodies. The output of Snowball Metrics is a set of mutually agreed and tested methodologies: “recipes”. These recipes are available free-of-charge and can be used by anyone for their own purposes. A freely available API: the Snowball Metrics Exchange service (SMX), acts as a free “broker service” for the exchange of Snowball Metrics between peer institutions who agree that they would like to share information with each other and any institution can become a member of the SMX. In this paper, we present a use case where the University of St Andrews reviewed its institutional level KPIs referring to the Snowball Metrics recipes. In conclusion, quantitative data inform, but do not and should not ever replace, peer review judgments of research quality – whether in a national assessment exercise, or for any other purpose. Metrics can support human judgment and direct further investigation to pertinent areas, thus contributing to a fully rounded view on the research question being asked.

The primary objective of this study was to describe the traditional metrics and Altmetric scores of the fifty most frequently cited articles published in emergency medicine (EM) journals. Since many articles related to EM are published in other journals, the secondary aim of this study was to describe the Altmetric scores of the most frequently cited articles relevant to EM in other biomedical journals. A structured search of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science version of the Science Citation Index Expanded was conducted. The 200 most frequently cited articles in the top ten EM journals (2011 Journal Citation Report) were identified. The 200 most frequently cited articles from the rest of the medical literature, matching a pre-defined list of keywords relevant to the specialty of EM, were identified. Two authors reviewed the lists of citations for relevance to EM and a consensus approach was used to arrive at the final lists of the top 50 cited articles. The Altmetric scores for the top fifty cited articles in EM and other journals were determined. Descriptive statistics and Spearman correlation were performed. The highest Altmetric score for EM articles was 25.0, the mean was 1.9 [SD=5.0]. The EM journal with the highest average article Altmetric score was Resuscitation. The main clinical areas shared for articles from EM articles were trauma (mean 11.0, median 11.0 [SD=15.6]) and cardiac arrest (mean 2.7, median 0 [SD=5.8]). The highest Altmetric score for other journals was 176.0, mean 23.3 [SD=40.8]. The other journal with the highest average article Altmetric score was the New England Journal of Medicine. The main clinical areas shared for articles were critical care (mean score 36.5, median 36.5 [SD= 47.4], sepsis (mean 24.6, median 12.0 [SD=48.8]), cardiology (mean 19.2, median 7.0 [SD=35.6]) and infectious diseases (mean 17.0, median 17.0 [SD=12.7]). Spearman correlation demonstrated weakly positive correlation between citation counts and Altmetric scores for EM articles, and other journals. This study is the first analysis of Altmetric scores for the top cited articles in emergency medicine. We demonstrated that there is a mild correlation between citation counts and Altmetric scores for the top papers in emergency medicine and other biomedical journals. We also demonstrated that there is a gap between the sharing of the top articles in emergency medicine journals and those related to emergency medicine in other biomedical journals. Future research to explore this relationship and its temporal trends will benefit the understanding of the reach and dissemination of emergency medicine research within the scientific community and society in general.

Fueled by the rise of the social web, new hope is often placed on alternative metrics that measure the attention scholarly publications receive online, in particular on social media. But almost a decade after the coining of the term altmetrics for this new group of indicators, the uptake of the concept in the Social Sciences still seems to be low. Just like with traditional bibliometric indicators, one central problem hindering the applicability of altmetrics for the Social Sciences is the low coverage of social science publications on the respective data sources – which in the case of altmetrics are the various social media platforms on which interactions with scientific outputs can be measured. Another reason is that social scientists have strong opinions about the usefulness of metrics for research evaluation which may hinder broad acceptance of altmetrics too. We conducted qualitative interviews and online surveys with researchers to identify the concerns which inhibit the use of social media and the utilization of metrics for research evaluation in the Social Sciences. By analyzing the response data from the interviews in conjunction with the response data from the surveys, we identify the key concerns that inhibit social scientists from (1) applying social media for professional purposes and (2) making use of the wide array of metrics available. Our findings show that aspects of time consumption, privacy, dealing with information overload, and prevalent styles of communication are predominant concerns inhibiting Social Science researchers from using social media platforms for their work. Regarding indicators for research impact we identify a widespread lack of knowledge about existing metrics, their methodologies and meanings as a major hindrance for their uptake through social scientists. The results have implications for future developments of scholarly online tools and show that researchers could benefit considerably from additional formal training regarding the correct application and interpretation of metrics.",3,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2018.00039/full https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2019/01/apo-nid220316-1332606.pdf https://apo.org.au/node/220316 https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frma.2018.00039/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frma.2018.00039,0,,10.3389/frma.2018.00039,2907616802,,003-953-279-211-843; 009-870-224-664-647; 010-141-385-349-31X; 011-854-399-312-637; 013-261-296-086-031; 024-704-447-017-762; 025-512-101-183-843; 040-252-626-797-747; 040-339-876-270-923; 041-523-405-481-309; 045-538-349-555-146; 058-951-756-693-125; 062-049-790-149-754; 063-144-189-164-648; 063-991-428-674-15X; 066-507-313-507-599; 068-624-912-307-025; 069-519-522-016-646; 071-553-317-316-747; 072-650-984-178-844; 083-391-191-182-558; 101-752-490-869-458; 105-402-220-957-576; 109-390-765-723-243; 129-082-483-754-27X; 143-804-082-399-413; 169-763-138-924-404; 173-268-100-530-414; 195-973-743-191-913,0

Firstly, this is because funders require evidence of return from investment and secondly and crucially because national research assessments are becoming powerful determinants of future funding. In research studies associated with nursing, impact needs to be demonstrated by showing the effect on a range of stakeholders including service users, patients, carers, the nursing workforce and commissioners. Engaging these groups is a well-known challenge influenced by lack of access to academic journals, lack of time to read long complex research papers and lack of opportunities to interact directly with the researchers. This needs to be addressed urgently to enable nursing research to increase the impact that it has on health delivery and the work of clinical practitioners. Social media is potentially a novel way of enabling research teams to both communicate about research as studies progress and to disseminate findings and research funders are increasingly using it to publicise information about research programmes and studies they fund. A search of the healthcare literature reveals that advice and guidance on the use of social media for research studies is not well understood or exploited by the research community. This paper, therefore, explores how using social networking platforms, notably Twitter™ offers potential new ways for communicating research findings, accessing diverse and traditionally hard-to-reach audiences, knowledge exchange at an exponential rate, and enabling new means of capturing and demonstrating research impact. The paper discusses approaches to initiate the setup of social networking platforms in research projects and considers the practical challenges of using Twitter™ in nursing and healthcare research. The discussion is illuminated with examples from our current research. In summary, we suggest that the use of social media micro-blogging platforms is a contemporary, fast, easy and cost effective way to augment existing ways of disseminating research which helps drive impact.",59,Health Services Research; Information Dissemination; Social Media,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222446 https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/using-twitter-to-drive-research-impact-a-discussion-of-strategies-opportunities-and-challenges(f3d86bb0-047f-463c-bed8-f494fe9189ea).html http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/34571/1/Schnitzler-K-34571-AAM.pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748916000729 https://www.journalofnursingstudies.com/article/S0020-7489(16)00072-9/fulltext https://core.ac.uk/display/74395024 http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/34571/ https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/47044201/1_s2.0_S0020748916000729_main.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748916000729,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2016.02.004,0,27222446,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2016.02.004,2274245116,,005-444-131-306-739; 006-569-922-930-672; 008-981-297-536-123; 010-176-402-324-967; 014-186-309-042-089; 015-668-960-857-20X; 018-934-656-518-404; 020-932-329-111-220; 021-339-119-767-968; 022-654-070-571-396; 027-991-394-082-053; 028-190-347-554-528; 028-404-360-871-019; 030-567-973-873-808; 032-972-088-634-216; 033-808-270-639-904; 034-368-810-407-697; 036-992-798-335-257; 040-099-753-635-830; 045-847-822-482-608; 046-798-169-710-118; 049-284-392-574-383; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-312-660-600-877; 051-862-690-247-990; 052-746-345-974-730; 055-360-820-304-259; 057-589-257-268-911; 060-647-054-175-919; 062-287-629-321-507; 066-002-495-120-577; 066-731-136-666-834; 070-588-465-449-959; 072-192-308-462-553; 086-243-591-700-048; 097-168-909-367-460; 098-234-435-889-919; 102-276-478-923-871; 102-501-207-280-972; 102-884-666-595-528; 107-148-090-673-322; 115-633-289-207-758; 120-869-060-973-296; 126-172-229-128-396; 164-233-751-793-174; 169-449-319-524-914; 171-975-919-253-806; 194-094-067-251-628,39

Vélez García-Nieto,"Abstract Objectives The aim of this study was to describe the relationship among abstract structure, readability, and completeness, and how these features may influence social media activity and bibliometric results, considering systematic reviews (SRs) about interventions in psoriasis classified by methodological quality. Study Design and Setting Systematic literature searches about psoriasis interventions were undertaken on relevant databases. For each review, methodological quality was evaluated using the assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews tool. Abstract extension, structure, readability, and quality and completeness of reporting were analyzed. Social media activity, which consider Twitter and Facebook mention counts, as well as Mendeley readers and Google scholar citations were obtained for each article. Analyses were conducted to describe any potential influence of abstract characteristics on review's social media diffusion. Results We classified 139 intervention SRs as displaying high/moderate/low methodological quality. We observed that abstract readability of SRs has been maintained high for last 20 years, although there are some differences based on their methodological quality. Free format abstracts were most sensitive to the increase of text readability as compared with more structured abstracts (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion or eight headings), yielding opposite effects on their quality and completeness depending on the methodological quality: a worsening in low quality reviews and an improvement in those of high quality. Both readability indices and preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses for Abstract total scores showed an inverse relationship with social media activity and bibliometric results in high methodological quality reviews but not in those of lower quality. Conclusion Our results suggest that increasing abstract readability must be specially considered when writing free format summaries of high-quality reviews because this fact correlates with an improvement of their completeness and quality, and this may help to achieve broader social media visibility and article usage.",101,Abstracting and Indexing/standards; Algorithms; Bibliometrics; Humans; Psoriasis/therapy; Quality Control; Research Report/standards; Social Media; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Writing/standards,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435617314130,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.05.015,0,29803759,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.05.015,2803419272,,005-394-458-714-336; 008-506-911-389-627; 010-393-512-386-940; 017-091-160-167-613; 017-104-460-279-190; 026-771-592-708-204; 027-586-684-142-748; 049-202-610-793-161; 051-447-539-517-902; 056-058-959-013-236; 073-341-691-098-75X; 074-510-011-013-208; 139-361-973-037-534; 144-939-649-257-286; 148-380-540-306-372; 163-591-801-241-575,2

This paper explores the relationship between traditional metrics and alternative metrics for psychological research in the years from 2010 to 2012. Traditional publication metrics (e.g., number of citations, impact factor) and alternative metrics (collected from Altmetric, a website that collects and counts references as they appear in Wikipedia, public policy documents, research blogs, mainstream media, or social networks) were extracted and compared, using a dataset of over 245,000 publications from the Web of Science. Results show positive, small to medium, correlations on the level of individual publications, and frequently medium to high correlations on the level of research fields of Psychology. The more accumulated the level of analysis, the higher the correlations. These findings are fairly robust over time and comparable to findings from research areas other than Psychology.

At the same time, twenty-first century states are increasingly concerned that this data could also be used for purposes of bioterrorism. There is thus a tension between the desire to promote the sharing of data, as encapsulated by the Open Data movement, and the desire to prevent this data from ‘falling into the wrong hands’ as represented by ‘dual use’ policies. Both frameworks posit a moral duty for life sciences researchers with respect to how they should make their data available. However, Open data and dual use concerns are rarely discussed in concert and their implementation can present scientists with potentially conflicting ethical requirements. Discussion Both dual use and Open data policies frame scientific data and data dissemination in particular, though different, ways. As such they contain implicit models for how data is translated. Both approaches are limited by a focus on abstract conceptions of data and data sharing. This works to impede consensus-building between the two ethical frameworks. As an alternative, this paper proposes that an ethics of responsible management of scientific data should be based on a more nuanced understanding of the everyday data practices of life scientists. Responsibility for these ‘micromovements’ of data must consider the needs and duties of scientists as individuals and as collectively-organised groups. Summary Researchers in the life sciences are faced with conflicting ethical responsibilities to share data as widely as possible, but prevent it being used for bioterrorist purposes. In order to reconcile the responsibilities posed by the Open Data and dual use frameworks, approaches should focus more on the everyday practices of laboratory scientists and less on abstract conceptions of data.",17,"Biological Science Disciplines/ethics; Biomedical Research/ethics; Bioterrorism; Dual Use Research/ethics; Ethics, Research; Genomics/ethics; Humans; Information Dissemination; Moral Obligations; Policy; Research Personnel/ethics; Social Responsibility",,https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12910-016-0112-6.pdf https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/656454 https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6 https://core.ac.uk/display/81859672 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184750 https://philpapers.org/rec/BEZBSA https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81859672.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6,0,27184750,10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6,2402858054,PMC4869374,000-785-692-812-344; 009-810-264-928-761; 013-141-915-399-509; 016-287-922-284-196; 019-538-368-158-59X; 021-016-082-052-03X; 023-954-389-252-259; 025-456-891-173-338; 027-120-308-689-470; 031-056-350-637-069; 032-125-141-715-991; 033-037-502-441-508; 039-719-395-430-673; 039-751-847-356-313; 041-229-127-618-629; 041-819-258-177-042; 042-306-349-866-073; 047-986-375-658-765; 052-639-816-234-621; 058-690-726-137-395; 060-193-688-777-651; 060-840-197-607-218; 062-444-616-254-321; 065-061-784-496-187; 076-836-849-618-369; 077-371-414-506-455; 079-295-007-196-358; 081-428-370-569-495; 083-147-550-827-377; 088-158-288-448-544; 103-239-470-212-024; 108-346-321-679-793; 112-676-267-621-641; 115-030-911-770-610; 117-536-577-693-672; 123-235-929-805-286; 140-507-931-893-361; 145-534-673-773-02X; 151-382-146-166-137; 167-078-567-551-863; 186-670-491-897-885; 188-270-297-190-317; 190-982-665-367-153,2

M. Page,"<jats:p>Through the Bloodhound proof-of-concept, https://bloodhound-tracker.net an international audience of collectors and determiners of natural history specimens are engaged in the emotive act of claiming their specimens and attributing other specimens to living and deceased mentors and colleagues. Behind the scenes, these claims build links between Open Researcher and Contributor Identifiers (ORCID, https://orcid.org) or Wikidata identifiers for people and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) specimen identifiers, predicated by the Darwin Core terms, <jats:italic>recordedBy</jats:italic> (collected) and <jats:italic>identifiedBy</jats:italic> (determined). Here we additionally describe the socio-technical challenge in unequivocally resolving people names in legacy specimen data and propose lightweight and reusable solutions. The unique identifiers for the affiliations of active researchers are obtained from ORCID whereas the unique identifiers for institutions where specimens are actively curated are resolved through Wikidata. By constructing closed loops of links between person, specimen, and institution, an interesting suite of potential metrics emerges, all due to the activities of employees and their network of professional relationships. This approach balances a desire for individuals to receive formal recognition for their efforts in natural history collections with that of an institutional-level need to alter budgets in response to easily obtained numeric trends in national and international reach. If handled in a coordinating fashion, this reporting technique may be a significant new driver for specimen digitization efforts on par with Altmetric, https://www.altmetric.com, an important new tool that tracks the impact of publications and delights administrators and authors alike.</jats:p>",3,,,https://biss.pensoft.net/article/35243/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.35243,0,,10.3897/biss.3.35243,2968817071,,,1

The goal is to contribute to the understanding of Twitter as a new altmetric measure for assessing impact of research articles. In this paper, we extended the previous study of tweet motivations by finding out the profiles of twitter users. In particular, we examined six characteristics of users: gender, geographic distribution, academic, non-academic, individual, and organization. Out of several, we would like to highlight here three key findings. First, a great majority of users (86%) were from North America and Europe indicating the possibility that, if in general, tweets for research articles are mainly in English, Twitter as an alternative metric has a Western bias. Second, several previous altmetrics studies suggested that tweets, and altmetrics in general, do not indicate scholarly impact due to their low correlation with citation counts. This study provides further details in this aspect by revealing that most tweets (77%) were by individual users, 67% of whom were nonacademic. Therefore, tweets mostly reflect impact of research articles on the general public, rather than on academia. Finally, analysis from profiles and motivations showed that the majority of tweets (from 42% to 57%) in all user types highlighted the summary or findings of the article indicating that tweets are a new way of communicating research findings.",5,,,http://koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=E1JSCH_2017_v5n3_48 https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10220/43940,http://koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=E1JSCH_2017_v5n3_48,0,,,2767077033,,,2

Aguillo,"Academics can now use the web and the social websites to disseminate scholarly information in a variety of different ways. Although some scholars have taken advantage of these new online opportunities, it is not clear how widespread their uptake is or how much impact they can have. This study assesses the extent to which successful scientists have social web presences, focusing on one influential group: highly cited researchers working at European institutions. It also assesses the impact of these presences. We manually and systematically identified if the European highly cited researchers had profiles in Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Mendeley, Academia and LinkedIn or any content in SlideShare. We then used URL mentions and altmetric indicators to assess the impact of the web presences found. Although most of the scientists had an institutional website of some kind, few had created a profile in any social website investigated, and LinkedIn--the only non-academic site in the list--was the most popular. Scientists having one kind of social web profile were more likely to have another in many cases, especially in the life sciences and engineering. In most cases it was possible to estimate the relative impact of the profiles using a readily available statistic and there were disciplinary differences in the impact of the different kinds of profiles. Most social web profiles had some evidence of uptake, if not impact; nevertheless, the value of the indicators used is unclear.",101,,,http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/97244/1/Do%20HCR%20Successfully%20use%20the%20Social%20Web%20%28preprint%29.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v101y2014i1d10.1007_s11192-014-1345-0.html https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1345-0 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2670815 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-014-1345-0 http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/DoHCRSuccessfullySocialWeb.pdf http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/97244 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:scient:v:101:y:2014:i:1:d:10.1007_s11192-014-1345-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1345-0,0,,10.1007/s11192-014-1345-0,2133129817,,001-516-552-569-187; 002-402-462-805-44X; 003-078-576-803-447; 003-168-179-893-142; 003-254-479-923-236; 004-905-757-477-241; 005-341-447-079-091; 005-699-111-606-288; 006-113-740-631-844; 006-369-072-945-600; 007-229-568-375-850; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-813-208-836-925; 013-123-944-981-275; 013-237-397-635-378; 014-409-506-780-772; 014-605-846-064-279; 016-574-404-432-904; 017-349-318-774-487; 019-457-587-825-722; 019-658-209-137-261; 020-647-409-662-919; 020-952-452-010-693; 021-692-860-225-683; 022-939-920-698-174; 023-898-989-623-283; 026-141-753-757-634; 027-361-510-759-169; 027-815-208-107-761; 029-186-189-428-511; 032-858-825-665-444; 036-929-472-363-934; 039-057-480-505-721; 041-489-894-326-185; 042-887-139-595-111; 042-926-965-327-580; 044-563-517-902-978; 045-072-136-172-086; 048-590-055-863-124; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-257-819-274-872; 053-920-541-627-557; 055-087-921-327-738; 055-430-689-149-505; 057-286-311-076-534; 062-426-191-595-550; 064-509-241-094-364; 064-603-744-048-635; 065-813-744-561-991; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-704-690-865-884; 069-453-487-924-85X; 069-738-251-250-579; 071-046-825-768-583; 078-908-802-635-930; 082-999-732-209-979; 086-809-706-245-39X; 088-019-011-262-974; 089-914-448-038-331; 090-539-224-982-001; 091-033-425-931-129; 094-229-785-102-846; 096-651-981-739-023; 098-813-895-295-296; 099-816-321-816-355; 099-889-795-138-039; 101-012-140-190-871; 110-457-195-877-695; 110-835-570-889-299; 116-004-210-033-746; 118-096-680-336-518; 118-587-164-553-344; 119-750-679-288-897; 122-073-156-920-876; 123-687-398-098-005; 128-610-192-568-565; 129-098-062-346-311; 132-306-181-457-198; 132-626-974-159-177; 140-750-789-105-933; 142-998-031-987-962; 149-040-025-444-303; 149-927-328-829-080; 152-988-229-115-477; 153-376-062-165-585; 154-016-219-227-690; 170-879-707-346-748; 172-807-061-309-058; 182-706-111-565-552; 185-099-554-359-448; 192-031-709-401-405; 197-500-232-702-809,79

Lanphear; Robert O. Wright,"Abstract Background Environmental exposures contribute to multiple diseases in children; yet, few pediatricians have training in pediatric environmental health (PEH), and few academic health centers have PEH expertise. To build national capacity in PEH, the Academic Pediatric Association (APA) launched a professional development program that since 2002 has encouraged the establishment of post-residency/post-doctoral training programs, supported a special interest group, and convened an annual mentored retreat for PEH trainees. Objective Describe the APA's professional development program in PEH and assess its impact by tracking careers of former trainees. Methods Careers were tracked through interviews with trainees and program directors supplemented by searches of institutional websites. Publication listings were obtained through PubMed. Publication impact was assessed using bibliometric and altmetric measures. Grant histories were accessed through the National Institutes of Health RePORTER project. Information on advocacy work was obtained through interviews with program directors. Results Fifty-five trainees (36 physicians and 19 health scientists) completed PEH training and attended the APA retreat between 2002 and 2017. Forty-one (75%) are pursuing academic careers, 11 are associate or full professors, 11 are practicing general pediatrics or a pediatric subspecialty, 2 are Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologists, and 1 is a data scientist. Forty-two former trainees (76%) listed “environment” or “environmental” in their job titles or on their websites. Former trainees have published 632 scientific papers. These papers have been cited 3094times, have a relative citation ratio of 2.97, and have been read or viewed 1,274,388times. Twenty-one former trainees have been awarded 43 National Institutes of Health grants. Trainees have developed education and advocacy skills by teaching medical students and residents, presenting grand rounds, preparing policy papers, presenting legislative testimony, and making presentations to public audiences. Conclusions The APA's professional development program has contributed to the expansion of national capacity in PEH. Former trainees are populating the field, generating new knowledge, and moving into leadership positions.",19,,,https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(19)30002-6/fulltext https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285919300026 https://hsrc.himmelfarb.gwu.edu/smhs_peds_facpubs/2792/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639371,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2019.01.001,0,30639371,10.1016/j.acap.2019.01.001,2908543029,,000-256-232-193-93X; 000-845-914-348-64X; 009-039-762-824-141; 010-230-898-605-31X; 012-197-024-307-718; 012-658-900-320-912; 013-973-348-652-126; 014-337-819-274-483; 016-565-194-010-775; 017-943-027-684-360; 018-518-020-689-037; 021-156-932-340-877; 026-082-033-509-280; 036-920-082-946-869; 037-692-804-810-088; 041-037-829-499-664; 043-423-805-592-627; 043-822-562-562-607; 045-250-962-221-686; 046-039-662-915-881; 047-240-857-870-784; 047-906-705-643-484; 050-423-302-039-495; 098-539-643-743-911; 122-685-525-492-852; 136-314-957-798-615,0

In order to do so, the Dimensions Pro version database was directly used to retrieve 97,531,400 documents, which were subsequently filtered to obtain the top journals, countries, cities, institutions, research fields and funding bodies according to the total number of publications indexed in the database. For each entity and year of publication (from 2000 to 2017), the corresponding percentage of publications cited and the Altmetric Attention Score (% mentioned) were calculated. The main results indicate that the total number of publications with an Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) of one or over one is low (9.4% out of the total coverage), which has been highly concentrated in recent years, and higher for open access documents (18.9%), showing an open access altmetric advantage. Otherwise, English-speaking universities stand out, which determines an increase in the presence of specific cities from Anglo-Saxon countries, diminishing the presence in Japan, China, Russia or India, despite their elevated productivity. Multidisciplinary and medicine-related journals are also highlighted, which in turn influences the research disciplines with a higher AAS (% mentioned): Genetics, Immunology, Microbiology or Medical Microbiology.

Parts of this process were formerly invisible. With scholarship moving online, we can now access various types of altmetrics digital traces such as reading, organizing, sharing and discussing scientific papers, thus develop a more holistic story about researchers and their work. However, a lack of in-depth interpretation of altmetrics digital traces is observed. Therefore, this paper focuses on reviewing some of existing altmetrics research, with a particular emphasis on the issues that need to be taken into consideration in the interpretation of altmetrics digital traces.

Principal component analysis was used to summarize the information on these metrics and detect groups of indicators. The results show that these metrics can be grouped into three components: social media, gathering metrics from social networks and online media; usage, including metrics on downloads and views; and citations and saves, grouping metrics related to research impact and saves in bookmarking sites.

Excluding Twitter (maximum 41%), no field had more than 12% of its articles registering a non-zero score on any altmetric five years after publication. In some cases, fields with relatively high levels of attention were due to self-publicity or the activities of individuals rather than public discussion. There were substantial differences between fields, with Classics and Literature & Literary Theory being almost ignored and Archeology generating a relatively high level of attention on Facebook.

This study is original in terms of its objective, and the data gathering scheme is descriptive of correlation type with a citation analysis approach. The population in this study consists of 90,728 research papers published in PLOS between 2009 and 2013. A sample of 1892 was chosen based on Cochran formula. The results showed that the visibility, Citeulike and Mendeley bookmarking counts have significant positive correlation with citations in all of the investigated systems. Conversely, social bookmarking counts on Figshare showed significant negative correlation with citations. Visibility metric has significant positive correlation with bookmarking counts in Citeulike and Mendeley, while it does not correlate with social bookmarking metric in Figshare. The results of this study suggest that sharing scientific publications in social networks such as Mendeley may increase the visibility and the future citations.",31,,,https://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2982-en.html http://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2982-fa.pdf,https://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2982-en.html,0,,,2414441297,,003-168-179-893-142; 003-358-831-161-370; 004-905-757-477-241; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-697-419-463-982; 014-069-410-581-703; 016-716-259-921-998; 019-007-990-305-286; 019-120-240-188-628; 019-226-991-602-231; 021-696-172-742-263; 030-099-848-668-595; 033-025-423-808-692; 038-846-917-667-041; 038-904-999-660-101; 042-960-490-465-267; 045-415-979-959-225; 049-316-012-536-347; 061-849-880-716-811; 066-234-580-862-965; 066-827-534-057-723; 066-869-158-046-590; 067-897-343-637-16X; 074-791-922-084-078; 081-980-027-973-107; 082-236-574-378-703; 085-228-177-458-717; 086-809-706-245-39X; 094-408-168-535-826; 102-973-599-213-44X; 110-348-276-031-242; 121-011-195-507-937; 122-073-156-920-876; 123-687-398-098-005; 128-511-665-080-540; 129-098-062-346-311; 141-134-741-084-026; 141-493-423-066-820; 155-841-325-091-746; 164-233-751-793-174,0

First, we investigate the distribution of subject areas in user libraries of educational technology researchers on Mendeley. The results show that around 69% of the publications in an average user library can be attributed to a single subject area. Then, we use co-readership patterns to map the field of educational technology. The resulting visualization prototype, based on the most read publications in this field on Mendeley, reveals 13 topic areas of educational technology research. The visualization is a recent representation of the field: 80% of the publications included were published within ten years of data collection. The characteristics of the readers, however, introduce certain biases to the visualization. Knowledge domain visualizations based on readership statistics are therefore multifaceted and timely, but it is important that the characteristics of the underlying sample are made transparent.",9,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157714001151 http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0348.pdf https://128.84.21.199/abs/1409.0348 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157714001151 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1409.html#KrakerSJL14 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.12.003 https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0348 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:infome:v:9:y:2015:i:1:p:169-182 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v9y2015i1p169-182.html http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0348,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.12.003,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2014.12.003,1973891872,,000-701-825-394-422; 005-011-849-467-618; 005-172-800-872-10X; 005-531-363-623-587; 005-650-400-596-170; 006-018-730-429-356; 008-449-824-979-225; 012-541-098-811-124; 023-927-221-065-800; 024-085-101-696-497; 030-671-248-846-321; 032-013-750-369-418; 037-036-602-845-527; 044-939-394-642-346; 044-959-160-435-748; 050-989-847-859-074; 051-827-329-087-005; 052-236-844-670-731; 054-818-565-070-154; 057-286-311-076-534; 063-789-423-782-849; 067-694-357-829-568; 069-090-810-480-380; 070-825-018-063-428; 074-754-102-682-192; 076-384-808-062-355; 081-881-380-080-111; 086-809-706-245-39X; 090-689-016-067-507; 091-842-351-634-825; 094-408-168-535-826; 099-816-321-816-355; 104-180-733-697-768; 106-020-771-207-088; 116-880-007-548-12X; 120-072-322-429-12X; 121-601-912-567-730; 123-687-398-098-005; 123-987-158-461-797; 125-461-692-288-257; 129-098-062-346-311; 130-472-793-008-597; 134-530-955-616-666; 138-270-687-058-342; 138-732-872-483-934; 144-837-804-461-424; 171-871-209-971-911; 172-016-003-187-100; 172-573-079-472-196; 176-321-961-173-059; 179-030-161-464-754; 185-037-913-518-41X; 191-628-176-364-562; 198-219-743-501-322,15

Despite their current popularity, there is a lack of information regarding the determinants of these metrics. Using publication and citation data from 1.3 million papers published in 2012 and covered in Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science as well as social media counts from Altmetric.com, this paper analyses the main patterns of five social media metrics as a function of document characteristics (i.e., discipline, document type, title length, number of pages and references) and collaborative practices and compares them to patterns known for citations. Results show that the presence of papers on social media is low, with 21.5% of papers receiving at least one tweet, 4.7% being shared on Facebook, 1.9% mentioned on blogs, 0.8% found on Google+ and 0.7% discussed in mainstream media. By contrast, 66.8% of papers have received at least one citation. Our findings show that both citations and social media metrics increase with the extent of collaboration and the length of the references list. On the other hand, while editorials and news items are seldom cited, it is these types of document that are the most popular on Twitter. Similarly, while longer papers typically attract more citations, an opposite trend is seen on social media platforms. Finally, contrary to what is observed for citations, it is papers in the Social Sciences and humanities that are the most often found on social media platforms. On the whole, these findings suggest that factors driving social media and citations are different. Therefore, social media metrics cannot actually be seen as alternatives to citations; at most, they may function as complements to other type of indicators.",10,Cooperative Behavior; Humans; Periodicals as Topic/statistics & numerical data; Social Media/statistics & numerical data,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120495 https://www.ost.uqam.ca/publications/characterizing-social-media-metrics-of-scholarly-papers-the-effect-of-document-properties-and-collaboration-patterns/ https://crc.ebsi.umontreal.ca/en/publications/characterizing-social-media-metrics-of-scholarly-papers-the-effect-of-document-properties-and-collaboration-patterns/ https://core.ac.uk/display/150371039 https://paperity.org/p/60336336/characterizing-social-media-metrics-of-scholarly-papers-the-effect-of-document-properties http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4425552 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aopenaccess.leidenuniv.nl%3A1887%2F49823 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4363625/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120495,0,25780916,10.1371/journal.pone.0120495,2081305716,PMC4425552; PMC4363625,002-455-602-950-673; 002-666-995-736-984; 007-827-370-558-74X; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-387-674-493-027; 010-409-999-603-436; 012-769-518-990-482; 017-718-406-024-003; 023-884-943-139-333; 024-383-348-891-724; 027-705-670-883-165; 031-484-334-998-05X; 036-278-922-594-558; 040-410-332-061-102; 041-694-859-470-811; 044-404-948-423-727; 046-271-827-410-790; 053-086-790-955-429; 054-802-232-146-783; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-936-134-187-936; 056-441-439-197-934; 057-058-693-769-402; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-896-099-397-138; 063-001-509-950-034; 066-066-200-239-224; 066-507-313-507-599; 068-624-912-307-025; 072-463-767-991-704; 073-946-550-452-593; 074-544-732-639-097; 076-236-672-324-867; 078-719-599-753-292; 084-338-851-600-30X; 084-571-982-315-26X; 086-218-521-591-494; 089-914-448-038-331; 092-349-900-678-968; 095-396-641-597-32X; 099-816-321-816-355; 105-402-220-957-576; 105-408-446-496-845; 107-033-329-932-235; 114-569-399-530-919; 115-613-371-837-232; 118-448-501-657-946; 121-011-195-507-937; 123-987-158-461-797; 127-458-994-664-604; 128-610-192-568-565; 144-020-036-006-042; 170-336-013-910-948,124

This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from 'RAF inhibitors prime wild-type RAF to activate the MAPK pathway and enhance growth' by Hatzivassiliou and colleagues, published in Nature in 2010 (Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010). Hatzivassiliou and colleagues examined the paradoxical response of RAF-WT tumors to treatment with RAF inhibitors. The key experiments being replicated include Figure 1A, in which the original authors demonstrated that treatment of a subset of BRAF(WT) tumor cell lines with RAF small molecule inhibitors resulted in an increase in cell viability, Figure 2B, which reported that RAF inhibitor activation of the MAPK pathway was dependent on CRAF but not BRAF, and Figure 4A, where the dimerization of BRAF and CRAF was modulated by the RAF inhibitor PLX4720, but not GDC-0879.

Some authors have suggested that measuring social media activity can predict the impact of a primary study (i.e., whether or not an article will be highly cited). However, the influence of variables such as scientific quality, research disclosures, and journal characteristics on systematic reviews and meta-analyses has not yet been assessed. The present study aims to describe the effect of complex interactions between bibliometric factors and social media activity on the impact of systematic reviews and meta-analyses about psoriasis (PROSPERO 2016: CRD42016053181). Methodological quality was assessed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. Altmetrics, which consider Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ mention counts as well as Mendeley and SCOPUS readers, and corresponding article citation counts from Google Scholar were obtained for each article. Metadata and journal-related bibliometric indices were also obtained. One-hundred and sixty-four reviews with available altmetrics information were included in the final multifactorial analysis, which showed that social media and impact factor have less effect than Mendeley and SCOPUS readers on the number of cites that appear in Google Scholar. Although a journal's impact factor predicted the number of tweets (OR, 1.202; 95% CI, 1.087-1.049), the years of publication and the number of Mendeley readers predicted the number of citations in Google Scholar (OR, 1.033; 95% CI, 1.018-1.329). Finally, methodological quality was related neither with bibliometric influence nor social media activity for systematic reviews. In conclusion, there seems to be a lack of connectivity between scientific quality, social media activity, and article usage, thus predicting scientific success based on these variables may be inappropriate in the particular case of systematic reviews.",13,Bibliometrics; Humans; Psoriasis; Social Media,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29377889 https://core.ac.uk/display/149286416,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191124,0,29377889,10.1371/journal.pone.0191124,2791108309,,001-788-981-268-621; 005-278-577-590-526; 007-205-762-763-201; 007-956-999-130-522; 008-506-911-389-627; 011-897-978-960-946; 013-261-296-086-031; 013-658-199-579-219; 018-241-426-139-167; 018-785-563-749-960; 040-252-626-797-747; 040-452-112-976-920; 043-875-449-790-607; 049-946-056-754-959; 050-252-270-491-60X; 059-222-532-022-222; 066-507-313-507-599; 072-463-767-991-704; 074-615-908-450-710; 076-730-596-742-437; 082-413-982-352-822; 116-412-339-675-806; 118-568-383-826-118; 122-353-860-287-425; 123-687-398-098-005; 127-458-994-664-604; 139-361-973-037-534; 155-171-030-721-421,6

The present study intended to monitor Iranian pediatrics articles, as one of the leading areas of scientific publications in Iran, between the years 2010-2016 using altmetrics and citation-metrics, and then evaluate the relationship between the altmetric score and number of received citations. Methods: This is a practical study of the analytical descriptive type and the research methodology is scientometrics. This research included 1332 research articles, review articles and conference articles in the field of pediatrics from Iran during 2010-2016, published in the Web of Science. Authors, year, journal and social media was determined in these articles. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS21 software and descriptive and inferential statistics (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Spearman correlation). Results: A total of 1138 articles have citations and 256 articles had altmetric activity. The results indicate a significant correlation among the articles’ altmetric scores and number of received citations. Among the data sources of altmetric score, mentions of articles in Mendeley, Twitter, and Facebook had the highest ranking. The number of times an article was read in Mendeley had a significant correlation with the number of citations. Conclusions: It seems that altmetrics better represent the impact of newer articles, while older articles had received more citations. In addition, a high number of reads in Mendeley correlates with received citations. However, Mendeley reads do not involve altmetric score calculation algorithms, and this should be implemented in the future.",6,,,https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1221,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.12020.1,0,,10.12688/f1000research.12020.1,2738414438,,010-057-293-861-47X; 016-245-338-843-424; 036-199-254-953-678; 036-606-137-737-701; 040-735-856-358-746; 040-761-208-292-979; 041-206-352-254-401; 051-965-959-247-371; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-333-019-958-953; 059-967-210-362-458; 066-507-313-507-599; 081-083-213-475-371; 091-525-476-466-432; 114-569-399-530-919; 122-073-156-920-876; 127-458-994-664-604,0

Research and scholarship in this area has accelerated since the coining and subsequent advocacy for altmetrics—that is, research indicators based on social media activity. This review provides an extensive account of the state-of-the art in both scholarly use of social media and altmetrics. The review consists of 2 main parts: the first examines the use of social media in academia, reviewing the various functions these platforms have in the scholarly communication process and the factors that affect this use. The second part reviews empirical studies of altmetrics, discussing the various interpretations of altmetrics, data collection and methodological limitations, and differences according to platform. The review ends with a critical discussion of the implications of this transformation in the scholarly communication system.",68,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1608.html#SugimotoWLH16 https://www.ost.uqam.ca/publications/scholarly-use-of-social-media-and-altmetrics-a-review-of-the-literature/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.23833 https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23833 http://www.cirst.uqam.ca/publications/scholarly-use-of-social-media-and-altmetrics-a-review-of-the-literature/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/asi.23833 https://crc.ebsi.umontreal.ca/en/publications/scholarly-use-of-social-media-and-altmetrics-a-review-of-the-literature/ https://cirst2.openum.ca/publications/scholarly-use-of-social-media-and-altmetrics-a-review-of-the-literature/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jinfst/v68y2017i9p2037-2062.html https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.23833 https://scinapse.io/papers/2518646621,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23833,0,,10.1002/asi.23833,2518646621,,000-024-682-815-625;

In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics. Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other. Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations. Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators. Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.

This calls into question if there is a measurable association between academic impact and Twitter use. We sought to quantify the relationship between the number of Twitter mentions and the number of academic citations a urologic oncology publication receives. Methods: 210 papers from 7 prominent urology journals were examined 18 months after publication from December 2014-January 2015. Articles were evaluated with 2 citation based “bibliometrics” (Scopus, Google Scholar) and 1 social media based metric (Altmetric). Altmetric software allowed for individual tweets regarding an article to be examined. Scores and Twitter mentions for oncology and non-oncology publications were compared using ANOVA and contingency analysis. Results: 79 articles were oncology related while 131 pertained to other topics. The mean number of Twitter mentions for oncology articles was 4.1, compared t...",35,,,http://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.6_suppl.70 https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.6_suppl.70,http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/jco.2017.35.6_suppl.70,0,,10.1200/jco.2017.35.6_suppl.70,2602530056,,,0

There have been numerous studies that have investigated factors affecting citation counts from the perspectives of cited papers and citing papers. In this paper, we focused specifically on citing papers and explored citations sourced from prestigious affiliations in the computer science discipline. The QS World University Rankings was employed to identify prestigious citations, named QS citations. We used the Microsoft Academic Graph, a massive scholarly dataset, and conducted different kinds of analysis between papers with QS citations and those without QS citations. We discovered that papers with QS citations are generally associated with higher total citation counts than those without QS citations. We extended the analysis to authors and journals, and the results indicated that when authors or journals have higher proportions of papers with QS citations, they are usually associated with higher values of the H-index or the Journal Impact Factor respectively. Additionally, papers with QS citations are also associated with a higher Altmetric Attention Score and a higher number of specific types of altmetrics such as tweet counts.",114,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v114y2018i1d10.1007_s11192-017-2571-z.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2571-z https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10220/44073 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3178096 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2571-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2571-z,0,,10.1007/s11192-017-2571-z,2770154893,,000-207-227-285-759; 005-688-363-332-013; 005-893-127-733-440; 009-538-546-892-402; 012-846-735-021-553; 013-286-362-190-621; 018-588-092-342-749; 021-120-673-715-990; 023-672-247-667-066; 026-365-650-771-727; 026-741-238-800-262; 028-604-217-799-831; 038-690-996-762-646; 044-615-951-990-415; 047-620-251-542-502; 050-520-028-733-867; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-131-519-754-594; 056-532-707-976-461; 058-238-890-202-143; 062-219-725-968-461; 089-626-329-660-842; 101-752-490-869-458; 103-199-876-285-449; 109-172-925-539-934; 116-545-813-640-686; 127-046-151-386-633; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-736-298-124-757; 132-723-851-457-646; 151-499-281-383-686; 152-435-379-838-62X; 159-470-015-652-451; 163-591-801-241-575; 168-267-940-904-41X; 192-208-728-572-091,11

Thus, the presented study has been guided by three research questions that consider the influence of astrophysicists’ activities (i.e., publishing and tweeting frequency) and of their tweet construction and affordance use (i.e. use of hashtags, language, and emotions) on the conversational connections they have on Twitter. We found that astrophysicists communicate with a variety of user types (e.g. colleagues, science communicators, other researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different professional roles can be distinguished. Interestingly, the analysis of noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address the different groups of very different professional composition they use very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.e. mentioning other user names in tweets). The results also showed that in those areas of the ego networks that tweeted more the sentiment of the tweets tended to be closer to neutral, connecting frequent tweeting with information sharing activities rather than conversations or expressing opinions.",9,Communication; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Internet/statistics & numerical data; Publishing/statistics & numerical data; Research Personnel/statistics & numerical data; Social Media/statistics & numerical data,,https://paperity.org/p/60468377/astrophysicists-conversational-connections-on-twitter http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0106086 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4143334/ https://crc.ebsi.umontreal.ca/publications/astrophysicists-conversational-connections-on-twitter/ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106086 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4143334 https://core.ac.uk/display/104850448,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0106086,0,25153196,10.1371/journal.pone.0106086,2006185078,PMC4143334,000-203-627-584-442; 000-701-825-394-422; 002-541-304-332-19X; 005-803-319-597-699; 010-660-863-614-021; 010-813-208-836-925; 017-622-071-383-533; 019-457-587-825-722; 020-355-816-549-206; 020-525-285-809-839; 020-855-028-493-10X; 020-887-358-310-341; 025-704-627-779-867; 032-045-757-545-089; 035-218-905-938-100; 035-783-384-830-891; 035-964-848-340-165; 040-452-112-976-920; 044-617-205-235-396; 047-273-317-607-724; 048-786-495-782-584; 049-165-020-087-240; 050-252-270-491-60X; 055-788-708-180-492; 057-071-031-236-70X; 057-309-957-529-204; 063-471-207-158-339; 066-507-313-507-599; 070-129-270-371-44X; 070-588-465-449-959; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-588-203-167-902; 078-548-441-504-583; 079-588-325-267-667; 093-436-515-272-47X; 094-258-818-297-188; 094-894-137-311-949; 102-276-478-923-871; 103-268-627-372-687; 107-285-693-534-592; 117-109-843-318-28X; 117-773-562-105-996; 122-073-156-920-876; 127-197-558-109-572; 137-178-304-268-505; 139-651-430-124-012; 143-488-955-076-815; 150-750-851-379-613; 157-538-785-033-898; 164-921-377-129-554; 169-247-540-649-34X; 170-943-882-378-660; 176-613-431-700-098; 195-810-714-941-635,19

Asi se encuentran dentro de estos productos libros, capitulos en libro, articulos cientificos, articulos de divulgacion, materiales de intervencion psicosocial, patentes, modelos, normas, software, artefactos de intervencion social, acciones de apropiacion social del conocimiento, participacion en escenarios academicos y sociales de los productos de investigacion, las acciones de transformacion de politica publica, como otros productos de innovacion social y los procesos de formacion asociados a la produccion de investigacion.; ; Luego, en este proceso de medicion es necesario evaluar los productos y esto presenta un alto nivel de complejidad. Por ejemplo, en el caso de los articulos publicados en revistas tienen una evaluacion mas clara por cuanto los mismos deben pasar por procesos de valoracion de pares y ademas, las revistas visibilizan la calidad mediante el reconocimiento que los investigadores dan a su trabajo expresado en los usos de estos contenidos. En este sentido, una revista con una alta citacion de sus contenidos puede generar un indicador de la calidad de los articulos de la misma y los sistemas de informacion de citacion o de descargas pueden darnos indicadores de esta dinamica de evaluacion de la calidad de estos productos. Pero esta informacion no solo es utilizada para valorar los productos sino que ademas hay estudios que muestran el uso, validez de tecnicas, trafico de videos o impacto de ciertos contenidos sobre una comunidad (Haran & Poliakoff, 2011; Sugimoto et al., 2013; Thelwall, Haustein, Lariviere, & Sugimoto, 2013).; ; Por otro lado y con un grado de complejidad mayor, la evaluacion de los libros y capitulos en libro no pasan por los mismos sistemas de valoracion y edicion previa, lo que anade una distancia en terminos de calidad percibida. Sin embargo, las editoriales se han dado cuenta hoy por hoy de la necesidad de contar con procesos transparentes y exigentes) de valoracion por pares de los contenidos. Es por esta razon que en gran parte de los sistemas de valoracion de productos que los articulos y los libros no tienen la misma asignacion de valor.; La valoracion de otras formas de produccion como la presentacion en eventos academicos o la presentacion en medios de difusion puede resultar un poco mas difusa, pues no todos los eventos academicos hacen evaluacion por pares y los medios de comunicacion no necesariamente deciden sus contenidos en relacion con la calidad de la investigacion si no por las dinamicas mediaticas que se escapan de la dinamica de la valoracion academica. No obstante, estas actividades podrian tener una valoracion en relacion con la difusion y las descargas en la red a este tipo de contenidos y en las citaciones que se hacen de ese contenido no solo en el ambito academicos, si no social (Thelwall et al., 2013). Ademas, dado que ha sido un campo creciente, debido a la facilidad en el acceso a la informacion, se han creado paginas que intentan evaluar los contenidos generados por fuera de sistemas tradicionales de produccion textos escritos, como por ejemplo los blogs (Zivkovic, 2011).; ; Por otro lado, otros productos que pueden ser facilmente valorables son las patentes; por cuanto pasan por procesos de evaluacion y reconocimiento de pares. Por el contrario, es un poco mas complejo valorar las intervenciones o las innovaciones sociales como las que se expresan en leyes o en documentos de politica publica, ya que deberian tener un reconocimiento importante por el impacto que generan en la sociedad. No obstante, las dinamicas politicas no necesariamente toman en cuenta estos contenidos de incidencia social solo por la fuerza de los hallazgos academicos, sino por las consecuencias politicas o economicas de las mismas. En este sentido, informes de politica publica o leyes que se logren con base en hallazgos de investigacion deberian tener un peso significativo en la evaluacion. Por otro lado estan productos un poco mas complejos de medir como los que estan asociados a incorporar resultados de investigacion a cambios en las dinamicas sociales en comunidades. Estos son mas dificiles de medir y valorar ya que no es posible dar cuenta de la calidad de los mismos y de sus impactos. Por lo anterior, es claro que estamos ante el reto de encontrar formas de medir su utilidad, impacto y calidad.; Los procesos de formacion pueden ser evaluados midiendo a los estudiantes en los proyectos y grupos de investigacion y en el caso de procesos de formacion en doctorado seguramente las tesis de maestria y doctorado pueden dar indicadores, tanto a corto como a largo plazo. Por ejemplo, algunos de estos tipos de productos terminan en libros y articulos en revistas generando mas indicadores menos inmediatos. Pero, es necesario pensar el tema por cuanto la formacion doctoral en contextos como el colombiano es incipiente y pueden existir centros de investigacion que no estan orientados a la formacion y no podrian dar cuenta de su actividad en esta dimension.; ; Tambien, es necesario tener en cuenta que estos sistemas de medida deben compararse contra las dinamicas propias de cada una de las areas de conocimiento. En este sentido, no es lo mismo evaluar los impactos de la biomedicina, que de la astronomia o de las ciencias sociales que de las humanidades. En el caso colombiano la produccion de articulos en ciencias sociales registrados en Scopus es grande y esta en crecimiento con relacion a otras areas del conocimiento , por lo tanto, no puede compararse si no contra si misma. Asi, las herramientas de contabilizar y visualizar la produccion (en este caso Scopus) permiten ver este crecimiento contrario a lo que algunos academicos sin evidencia pueden llegar a afirmar. La estrategia de Scopus de inclusion de revistas de America Latina en forma exponencial y en especial de abrirle la puerta a las revistas de ciencias sociales y humanidades permite dar cuenta de las dinamicas de citacion de estos productos en forma cada vez mas fiable.; ; Por ultimo y como una forma de recoger en muchos casos la discrepancia ante los sistemas de medicion, es necesario que se evaluen los sistemas de ponderacion de los productos y los pesos de los mismos. Al igual que las ventanas de evaluacion temporal y de las limitaciones de los sistemas de registro, pues las fallas en estos sistemas de registro y ponderacion pueden deslegitimar el sistema de valoracion. En el caso colombiano, estas fallas, por lo general, han generado desconfianza y el sistema deberia definir estrategias de ajuste y de mejoramiento en el proceso hasta que el mismo sea suficientemente robusto y confiable. Otro elemento adicional deberia ser el comparar estos modelos de medicion entre paises (mediciones comparables a nivel internacional) para identificar las debilidades y las fortalezas como los impactos que ellos tienen sobre las dinamicas de produccion academica.; Con todo lo anterior, lo que si parece evidente es que no podemos escapar de los procesos de evaluacion y que debemos contribuir a mejorar los mismos a estudiar sus impactos y a asegurar la calidad de los mismos, justificando y valorando su uso al interior de la comunidad academica y social.; ; Referencias; ; Haran, B., & Poliakoff, M.

The analysis is conducted from the author’s perspective of the integrated science of science and the history and methodology of the science of science following this perspective. Particular emphasis is placed on the history and methodology of scientometrics and bibliometrics and the history and methodology of science. This perspective is a new approach to the subject matter and determines a) how to select publications and their interpretations and b) which hierarchy the analyzed issues should follow.; The article describes the view, dominant both in the world and in Poland, on the basics of scientometrics and bibliometrics and their numerous serious scientific restrictions, such as: a) the incompatibility of the so‑called scientometric laws and the Garfield law of concentration with the empirical data; b) the domain bias, the language bias and the geographical bias of indexation databases; c) various practices of scientific communication; d) the local (national or state‑ level) orientation of humanities, social sciences and citation indexes; e) the disadvantages of the impact factor (IF), the manipulations with its values and the “impact factor game”; f) the numerous problems with and abuses of citations, e.g. the Mendel syndrome, the “classic” publication bias, the palimpsestic syndrome, the effect of the disappearance of citations, the so‑called Matthew effect, the theft of citations, the so‑called secondary and tertiary citations, negative citations, “fashionable nonsenses”, forced citations, the pathologies of the so‑ called citation cartels or cooperative citations, the guest authorship and the honorable authorship; g) the distinction between the “impact of publication” and the “importance of publication” or the “significance” of publication; h) the effectiveness of indexation of publications in electronic and Internet databases and; the technological modernity of publications. The discovery of such restrictions regarding scientometrics and bibliometrics has led to the creation of, among others, biobibliometrics, alternative metrics (“altmetrics”) and the open science movement.; The analysis of this information results in a general conclusion that is relevant to the current scientific policy in Poland, i.e. it is necessary to resist the “tyranny of bibliometrics”, because it does not serve the development of science. As a consequence, the use of scientometric methods in evaluations of scientific activities should be limited, particularly in the humanities and social sciences.; The article also advocates for implementing the idea, considered as priority, of the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education, which is the promotion of the achievements of Polish humanities and social sciences at home and abroad. In order to achieve this aim, the following is proposed: a) developing the integrated science of science (as protection against the numerous errors of scientometrics and bibliometrics); b) expanding indexation databases of publications, digital libraries and digital repositories; c) intensifying the participation of Polish scientists in international research, including becoming actively involved in the international project aiming at building a European indexation database for humanities and social sciences, d) developing open access to scientific contents and e) modernizing Polish scientific journals and scientific publishing.</jats:p>",14,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.desklight-7aeb6233-ee09-45f5-91b0-9b9f095b449e http://www.ejournals.eu/Studia-Historiae-Scientiarum/2015/Tom-XIV/art/7465/,http://dx.doi.org/10.4467/23921749pkhn_pau.16.008.5264,0,,10.4467/23921749pkhn_pau.16.008.5264,2494201781,,013-286-362-190-621; 024-852-209-797-868; 032-769-560-257-95X; 040-801-946-649-961; 052-465-481-786-266; 059-892-930-642-905; 067-806-859-907-638; 138-533-192-509-932,4

Moed; Gali Halevi,"This article introduces the Multidimensional Research Assessment Matrix of scientific output. Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends on the unit of assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance, publication counts are useful tools to help discriminate between those staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared with one another according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics, including altmetrics, applied at the level of individual articles, individual researchers, research groups, and institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension. It introduces the concept of a “meta-analysis” of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process.",66,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23314 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1406.html#MoedH14 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jinfst/v66y2015i10p1988-2002.html http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23314/abstract https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.23314 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asi.23314,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23314,0,,10.1002/asi.23314,1696956904,,001-384-124-729-410; 001-816-931-583-59X; 004-228-191-503-109; 005-851-701-395-330; 006-113-740-631-844; 007-299-936-418-636; 009-249-300-819-036; 010-280-490-992-059; 010-353-698-761-65X; 010-610-048-175-215; 014-162-175-828-388; 015-877-689-868-067; 017-338-131-896-51X; 017-403-129-312-608; 022-615-539-334-493; 023-965-726-805-832; 024-240-694-091-801; 024-383-348-891-724; 029-830-737-897-39X; 030-124-384-433-238; 031-922-806-494-181; 032-636-565-424-295; 032-712-531-326-912; 037-400-773-374-836; 037-547-953-555-104; 041-055-122-253-336; 042-390-023-586-949; 043-354-727-537-377; 043-495-392-935-371; 044-208-097-571-714; 044-237-116-946-482; 044-489-501-001-590; 044-743-706-846-133; 044-939-394-642-346; 046-679-361-281-155; 048-279-533-604-441; 049-316-012-536-347; 051-471-653-993-486; 052-548-921-979-744; 056-997-014-062-261; 059-735-116-258-934; 059-763-598-676-431; 060-123-990-003-67X; 062-620-034-705-938; 063-904-755-424-483; 064-619-520-365-224; 073-628-617-778-798; 076-236-672-324-867; 079-483-578-682-93X; 083-282-917-695-529; 083-743-164-554-017; 084-467-643-433-579; 087-945-386-404-840; 088-544-731-777-736; 090-062-437-247-54X; 094-408-168-535-826; 095-477-117-567-33X; 096-244-810-606-498; 098-234-435-889-919; 098-620-354-832-756; 101-752-490-869-458; 110-457-195-877-695; 110-580-969-132-595; 112-872-646-176-97X; 116-545-996-099-174; 119-726-355-482-28X; 121-239-756-963-133; 123-704-353-547-083; 125-978-780-052-043; 128-964-426-819-266; 133-936-881-842-268; 145-248-816-877-559; 149-808-639-989-493; 157-237-861-291-700; 158-516-491-860-942; 171-488-792-341-447; 177-787-582-091-521; 182-706-111-565-552; 196-040-456-741-208; 198-345-493-879-484,59

This study uses the records of 23,798 articles published in 16 Frontiers journals from 2007 to 2015 to analyse the geographical distribution of article visits at both country and city levels. The process of knowledge diffusion is investigated on the basis of the different visiting patterns of new and old papers.; ; ; ; ; Findings; ; ; ; ; Most article visits are concentrated around major metropolitan areas and some high-tech clusters. The top “visiting countries” include both developed countries and developing countries, and the USA and China are two major players. Publishing cities dominate article visits for new papers; as time passes, there is diffusion from the publishing cities to a broader area.; ; ; ; ; Research limitations/implications; ; ; ; ; The data on visiting for open access articles may be generated from various repositories besides the publishers’ websites; these data are ignored, as they are not significant enough to have much influence. There is also a lack of a basic theory in the data processing of outliers in the data set. In addition, only static results are given in this paper, as the data were collected on one day, for one time. A longer time period is necessary to track the dynamic diffusion process of the observations.; ; ; ; ; Practical implications; ; ; ; ; Introduction of usage data will propose a novel way to analyse research activities and track knowledge diffusion.; ; ; ; ; Social implications; ; ; ; ; The visiting data of articles offer a new way to investigate research activities at the city level in a detailed and timely manner, for the geographical distribution of research activities and the research resource allocation of a specific country to be explored.; ; ; ; ; Originality/value; ; ; ; ; This study measured the research activities of scientific papers by examining the usage data. Compared with previous studies that focused on the geographical distribution of scientific activities using publication data, citation data and even altmetrics data, usage data are at the forefront of this research.

We combine data from Web of Science and this http URL, a platform which retrieves mentions to scientific literature from social media and other non-academic communication outlets. We focus on the dissemination of microbial publications in Twitter, news media and policy briefs. A two-mode network of social accounts shows distinctive areas of activity. We identify a cluster of papers mentioned solely by regional news media. A central area of the network is formed by papers discussed by the three outlets. A large portion of the network is driven by Twitter activity. When analyzing top actors contributing to such network, we observe that more than half of the Twitter accounts are bots, mentioning 32% of the documents in our dataset. Within news media outlets, there is a predominance of popular science outlets. With regard to policy briefs, both international and national bodies are represented. Finally, our topic analysis shows that the thematic focus of papers mentioned varies by outlet.

In order to investigate the validity of these claims, we performed a fifteen-month longitudinal study of the evolution of bookmarks in Mendeley for a set of 3813 articles published in Library and Information Science in 2014. Results show that 87.6% of the literature was bookmarked at least once by May 2016 whereas only 55% was cited. The correlation between bookmarks and citations was moderate and the overlap between the most frequently bookmarked and the most frequently cited papers increased over time. A significant share of the bookmarks were made by students and professionals, although the shares of bookmarks made by different categories of users changed as time went by. Bookmarks made by users based in less wealthy nations also increased over time. The study is limited by the incomplete information provided by Mendeley regarding users’ academic status and country of residence, the upgrades of the software used in data collection, and the fact that one year is a rather long publication period for a longitudinal study of a fast-changing feature like bookmarks.",10,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2016.10.003 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157716301857 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v10y2016i4p1135-1142.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2016.10.003,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2016.10.003,2534269441,,003-168-179-893-142; 004-924-180-697-031; 030-991-320-426-958; 051-472-143-393-282; 057-286-311-076-534; 061-787-537-642-877; 067-897-343-637-16X; 073-289-669-154-801; 075-563-711-739-195; 076-399-144-464-512; 082-467-309-208-04X; 097-994-139-888-028; 105-011-504-353-741; 121-011-195-507-937; 129-542-995-568-184; 130-446-333-613-121; 146-046-930-226-363; 154-624-043-536-340; 170-943-882-378-660,9

The survey questionnaire was distributed between 1 October 2014 and 31 January 2015. A total of 391 respondents, from four research areas (humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences) completed the questionnaire. The finding indicated that motivations for citing were complex and multi-faceted, but in all four disciplines, researchers cite a work because they regard it as an authoritative and trustworthy source, which provides a context or building block to their own research. Although researchers have moved from a print-based system to a digital one, it has not significantly changed the way they decide what to trust. Peer reviewed journals are still the most influential. Open access journals will be cited if they have been peer reviewed. Citing on the basis of high altmetrics and other social judgements, such as mentions, likes, and use, was not prevalent.

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of experiments from ""A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations"" by Sharma and colleagues, published in Cell in 2010 (Sharma et al., 2010). Sharma and colleagues demonstrated that prolonged exposure of cancer cells to TKIs give rise to small populations of ""drug tolerant persisters"" (DTPs) (Figure 1B-C) that were reversed during subsequent maintenance under drug-free conditions (Figures 1E, 2B and 2E). DTPs exhibited reduced histone acetylation and sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) (Figure 4A-B). Drug sensitivity was restored with co-treatment of either HDIs or an IGF-1R inhibitor, in combination with TKIs (Figure 5A-B). Inhibition of IGF-1R activation also led to decreased KDM5A expression and restoration of H3K4 methylation, suggesting a direct link between the IGF-1R signaling pathway and KDM5A function (Figure 7A, 7C, and 7I). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.",5,Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology; Chromatin/metabolism; Drug Tolerance; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology; Humans; Neoplasms/physiopathology; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors,Antineoplastic Agents; Chromatin; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4775209/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26905833 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26905833 https://elifesciences.org/articles/09462,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.09462,0,26905833,10.7554/elife.09462,2300498508,PMC4775209,001-065-799-098-217; 008-916-044-336-915; 013-128-430-742-763; 018-355-128-667-100; 019-075-185-239-997; 024-939-841-702-422; 025-480-893-929-485; 026-965-326-577-454; 027-443-705-186-005; 028-798-718-107-117; 028-940-206-987-59X; 032-049-177-406-929; 033-022-479-510-111; 035-917-879-508-571; 036-188-977-538-300; 041-480-787-664-25X; 047-956-140-830-80X; 052-037-156-892-128; 053-987-110-139-064; 055-029-887-954-811; 061-107-423-127-162; 064-037-889-643-298; 076-240-393-081-630; 076-466-107-609-61X; 076-823-295-797-859; 077-148-906-527-074; 088-714-369-718-360; 125-752-556-941-530; 131-969-074-107-791; 150-325-162-873-23X; 155-309-411-552-317,2

Wild,"Social media has revolutionized the way research and museum collections communicate with the general public by disseminating knowledge and information in real time. Currently there are limited studies examining the use of social media by museums and entomological collections to engage the general public online. Social media has the power to promote museum and collection events, research, and staff, as well as raise awareness of entomological collections and demonstrate their relevance to the public, industry, policy makers, and potential students of entomology. Here we introduce SCOPE, a new framework for promoting museums and entomological collections using social media. The SCOPE framework streamlines strategy development, content choice, refinement of online engagement, choice of social media platform, and evaluation of social media campaigns using altmetrics. Case studies from the Australian National Insect Collection, CSIRO, and National Museums Scotland following the SCOPE framework are provided so that other museums, entomological collections, staff, and students can replicate it to develop and maintain their own social media presence.",110,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/132609253 https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article/110/5/467/4103476 http://repository.nms.ac.uk/1952/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/sax058,0,,10.1093/aesa/sax058,2750595024,,002-506-821-424-056; 005-913-714-083-134; 023-497-337-279-969; 024-872-007-500-825; 031-212-734-377-659; 034-513-641-107-594; 040-761-208-292-979; 043-920-431-409-855; 045-050-383-202-070; 050-252-270-491-60X; 052-221-480-960-460; 058-540-228-119-633; 059-834-715-483-993; 066-777-152-859-613; 071-103-957-926-588; 072-910-743-138-938; 077-613-766-936-212; 083-994-361-066-940; 092-936-989-329-460; 196-574-763-762-70X; 197-671-806-970-025,2

Article-level metrics (ALM) is the result of the aggregation of different data sources and the collection of content from multiple social network services. Sources used for the aggregation can be broken down into five categories: usage, captures, mentions, social media and citations. Data sources depend on the tool, but they include classic metrics indicators based on citations, academic social networks (Mendeley, CiteULike, Delicious) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, or Youtube, among others). Altmetrics is not synonymous with alternative metrics. Altmetrics are normally early available and allow to assess the social impact of scholarly outputs, almost at the real time.

PurposeCreate an index of global reach for healthcare hashtags and tweeters therein, filterable by topic of interest. Materials and methodsFor this proof-of-concept study we focused on the field of Primary Care and Family Medicine. Six hashtags were selected based on their importance, from the ones included in the Healthcare Hashtag Project. Hashtag Global Reach (HGR) was calculated using the additive aggregation of five weighted, normalized indicator variables: number of impressions, tweets, tweeters, user locations, and user languages. Data were obtained for the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 using Symplur Signals. Topic-specific HGR were calculated for the top 10 terms and for sets of quotes mapped after a thematic analysis. Individual Global Reach, IGR, was calculated across hashtags as additive indexes of three indicators: replies, retweets and mentions. ResultsUsing the HGR score we were able to rank six selected hashtags and observe their performance throughout the study period. We found that #PrimaryCare and #FMRevolution had the highest HGR score in both quarters; interestingly, #FMChangeMakers experienced a marked increase in its global visibility during the study period. Health Policy was the commonest theme, while Care, Family and Health were the most common terms. DiscussionThis is the first study describing an altmetric hashtag index. Assuming analytical soundness, the Index might prove generalizable to other healthcare hashtags. If released as a real-time business intelligence tool with customizable settings, it could aid publishing and strategic decisions by netizens, organizations, and analysts. IGR could also serve to augment academic evaluation and professional development.

In this paper, we examine tweets containing links to research articles in the field of dentistry to assess the extent to which tweeting about scientific papers signifies engagement with, attention to, or consumption of scientific literature. The main goal is to better comprehend the role Twitter plays in scholarly communication and the potential value of tweet counts as traces of broader engagement with scientific literature. In particular, the pattern of tweeting to the top ten most tweeted scientific dental articles and of tweeting by accounts is examined. The ideal that tweeting about scholarly articles represents curating and informing about state-of-the-art appears not to be realized in practice. We see much presumably human tweeting almost entirely mechanical and devoid of original thought, no evidence of conversation, tweets generated by monomania, duplicate tweeting from many accounts under centralized professional management and tweets generated by bots. Some accounts exemplify the ideal, but they represent less than 10% of tweets. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from twitter data is swamped by the mechanical nature of the bulk of tweeting behavior. In light of these results, we discuss the compatibility of Twitter with the research enterprise as well as some of the financial incentives behind these patterns.",12,Journal Impact Factor; Publishing; Social Media,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28837664 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aopenaccess.leidenuniv.nl%3A1887%2F57883 https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/161761 https://core.ac.uk/display/149203475 https://works.bepress.com/diana_hicks/51/download/ https://works.bepress.com/diana_hicks/51/ https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183551,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183551,0,28837664,10.1371/journal.pone.0183551,2745888331,,001-731-506-576-898; 003-330-836-348-789; 007-359-816-909-053; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-499-733-594-309; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-141-385-349-31X; 015-892-661-562-133; 019-265-590-591-246; 020-902-218-185-377; 021-120-673-715-990; 024-704-447-017-762; 027-261-304-958-951; 029-007-700-188-011; 030-361-644-340-871; 034-061-384-808-888; 034-073-504-767-899; 035-181-820-222-262; 035-414-158-125-621; 035-678-282-600-695; 037-331-683-577-73X; 044-794-989-497-868; 049-902-212-921-284; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-347-379-873-984; 051-710-296-465-276; 053-144-964-894-842; 057-286-311-076-534; 066-507-313-507-599; 070-803-002-532-966; 072-463-767-991-704; 085-254-459-101-707; 089-341-797-358-952; 101-319-089-660-626; 102-276-478-923-871; 105-709-789-935-415; 114-569-399-530-919; 117-386-465-780-295; 120-144-800-951-044; 122-073-156-920-876; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-447-414-802-548; 155-895-048-471-997; 184-467-759-877-37X; 186-429-639-951-411,27

The Spearman correlation test was performed to compare the impact of the journals on SM and other sources. The results reveal that 2923 articles published in 122 of the 273 South African (SA) journals have received at least one mention in SM; the most commonly used SM platforms were Twitter and Facebook; the journals indexed in the TR’s citation indexes and Scopus performed much better, in terms of their average altmetrics, than non-TR and non-Scopus indexed journals; and there were weak to moderate relationships among different types of altmetrics and citation-based measures, thereby implying different kinds of journal impacts on SM when compared to the scholarly impact reflected in citation databases.

In total, 149 suggestions were made by 42 respondents, mainly UK librarians. Responses could be categorized into four main themes: A) Improve and share your data; B) Be more responsible; C) Improve your tools; D) Improve your indicators. The findings of the survey are discussed and sample comments shared. Based on these findings, and expanding on the four themes, the article makes a number of practical recommendations to metrics suppliers for ways in which their services could better serve the need of the community for robust and responsible bibliometric and altmetric evaluation.",31,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/How_can_bibliometric_and_altmetric_vendors_improve_Messages_from_the_end-user_community/9491180 https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/34685 https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.437/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1629/uksg.437,0,,10.1629/uksg.437,2895122532,,006-435-774-453-89X; 072-713-575-367-447,1

We call this method multifaceted analysis of disciplines through academic profiles (MADAP). The international community of researchers working in Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, Informetrics, Webometrics, and Altmetrics was selected as a case study. The records of the top 1000 most cited documents by these authors according to GSC were manually processed to fill any missing information and deduplicate fields like the journal titles and book publishers. The results suggest that it is feasible to use GSC and the MADAP method to produce an accurate depiction of the community of researchers working in Bibliometrics (both specialists and occasional researchers) and their publication habits (main publication venues such as journals and book publishers). Additionally, the wide document coverage of Google Scholar (specially books and book chapters) enables more comprehensive analyses of the documents published in a specific discipline than were previously possible with other citation indexes, finally shedding light on what until now had been a blind spot in most citation analyses.",114,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11209 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v114y2018i3d10.1007_s11192-017-2587-4.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2587-4 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2587-4 https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11209 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2587-4 https://digibug.ugr.es/handle/10481/50320 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1804.html#abs-1804-11209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2587-4,0,,10.1007/s11192-017-2587-4,2768096408,,001-311-234-725-616; 003-254-479-923-236; 005-977-346-694-080; 008-818-583-504-86X; 010-387-674-493-027; 010-815-543-742-159; 012-207-103-592-20X; 014-904-298-227-056; 018-283-459-249-237; 021-696-172-742-263; 027-223-522-317-733; 027-361-510-759-169; 030-671-248-846-321; 032-114-706-877-872; 036-476-020-758-151; 038-111-474-488-804; 038-748-784-601-081; 039-654-386-070-819; 039-938-739-884-303; 044-495-558-344-456; 048-421-366-629-821; 049-012-192-454-37X; 050-620-415-061-78X; 052-473-316-272-050; 059-767-003-471-882; 063-789-423-782-849; 064-441-486-899-496; 064-674-585-297-201; 065-951-100-643-938; 066-244-989-182-673; 073-105-177-560-919; 073-981-358-116-34X; 077-261-180-048-537; 083-219-259-466-22X; 084-583-032-677-361; 085-001-502-383-40X; 086-809-706-245-39X; 087-802-624-733-386; 090-689-016-067-507; 091-008-418-033-625; 099-816-321-816-355; 101-026-687-181-95X; 107-518-655-388-824; 110-412-068-113-685; 119-239-701-895-258; 119-589-110-380-404; 120-537-030-826-657; 122-073-156-920-876; 123-202-581-406-928; 127-454-023-499-097; 128-518-301-677-700; 132-388-166-608-244; 132-729-617-933-920; 133-819-211-702-976; 137-404-269-292-19X; 142-838-395-521-888; 147-023-625-223-646; 147-353-292-377-955; 149-661-584-078-911; 152-032-578-590-86X; 154-394-780-483-540; 160-462-293-223-417; 161-969-341-801-090; 168-087-614-061-500; 170-943-882-378-660; 183-838-110-033-926; 189-638-011-101-462,4

Tennant; François Waldner; Damien Christophe Jacques; Paola Masuzzo; Lauren Brittany Collister; C.H.J. Hartgerink,Ongoing debates surrounding Open Access to the scholarly literature are multifaceted and complicated by disparate and often polarised viewpoints from engaged stakeholders. At the current stage Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing including policymakers publishers research funders governments learned societies librarians and academic communities to be well-informed on the history benefits and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this there is a general lack of consensus regarding the potential pros and cons of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas: academic economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research several key trends are identified including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. However Open Access has the potential to become unsustainable for research communities if high-cost options are allowed to continue to prevail in a widely unregulated scholarly publishing market. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing. Yet it provides one foundation for increasing engagement with researchers regarding ethical standards of publishing and the broader implications of Open Research. Copyright: © 2016 Tennant JP et al.

Altmetrics provide additional, supplementary information and can balance misleading metrics tied to particular journals. More timely than traditional metrics, altmetrics quickly reveal the impact of recent work and add authority to different types of scholarly products not captured as articles. Altmetrics can capture social media references that escape traditional metrics and reflect public engagement prompted by scholarly writing. The availability of altmetrics expands publishing opportunities to include new venues and stimulates innovative strategies for evaluating research.

Many publishers currently encourage authors to supplement their articles with GAs, in the hope that such a convenient visual summary will facilitate readers with a clearer outline of papers that are of interest and will result in improved overall visibility of the respective publication. To test this assumption, we statistically compared publications with or without GA published in Molecules between March 2014 and March 2015 with regard to several output parameters reflecting visibility. Contrary to our expectations, manuscripts published without GA performed significantly better in terms of PDF downloads, abstract views, and total citations than manuscripts with GA.

For each article, we recorded the publishing journal, subfield of ID, study type, nation and degree of the lead author, and sample size, and we assigned the paper up to three topic keywords. Our outcomes of interest were the publishing journal’s Scimago Journal Rank (SJR), a surrogate for journal tier, and the article’s Altmetric score, a surrogate for audience engagement.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Results</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>Of 146 articles included in the analysis, the most common study types were retrospective observational (n = 47), randomized controlled trial (n = 23), in vitro (n = 20), and prospective observational (n = 19). The median sample size was 238; median sample sizes were higher for randomized controlled trials (n = 400) and lower for in vitro and pharmacokinetic/pharmacokinetic studies (n = 53 and n = 44). Lead authors were based in the United States in 38% of cases and in North America or Europe in 86% of cases. Physicians accounted for 65% of lead authors, PhDs 23%, and PharmDs 10%. The most commonly referenced pathogens were HIV, MDR Gram-negative bacteria, S. aureus, and C. difficile; the most commonly referenced disease states were bacteremia, sexually transmitted infection, respiratory tract infection, and UTI. The mean SJR was 3.5 (SD 3.1) and the mean Altmetric score was 54.5 (SD 143). SJR and Altmetric score were associated with study type, sample size, and key topics; Altmetric score was also associated with publishing journal. In multivariate analysis, SJR was associated with study type and sample size, and Altmetric score was associated with ID subfield, journal, and sample size.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>We present a descriptive overview of the ID literature and identify article factors associated with journal tier and audience engagement after publication.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>;                <jats:sec>;                   <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>;                   <jats:p>All authors: No reported disclosures.</jats:p>;                </jats:sec>",6,,,http://academic.oup.com/ofid/article-pdf/6/Supplement_2/S890/30271651/ofz360.2242.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofz360.2242,0,,10.1093/ofid/ofz360.2242,2982115444,,,0

For several altmetrics indicators, NP has moderate to low correlation with NUU. User category is found to have huge impact on altmetrics count.

This concept raises from the development of new indicators based on Web 2.0, for the evaluation of the research and academic activity. The basic assumption is that variables such as mentions in blogs, number of twits or of researchers bookmarking a research paper for instance, may be legitimate indicators for measuring the use and impact of scientific publications. In this sense, these indicators are currently the focus of the bibliometric community and are being discussed and debated. We describe the main platforms and indicators and we analyze as a sample the Spanish research output in Communication Studies.

Comins; Staša Milojević,"We argue that citation is a composed indicator: short-term citations can be considered as currency at the research front, whereas long-term citations can contribute to the codification of knowledge claims into concept symbols. Knowledge claims at the research front are more likely to be transitory and are therefore problematic as indicators of quality. Citation impact studies focus on short-term citation, and therefore tend to measure not epistemic quality, but involvement in current discourses in which contributions are positioned by referencing. We explore this argument using three case studies: (1) citations of the journal Soziale Welt as an example of a venue that tends not to publish papers at a research front, unlike, for example, JACS; (2) Robert Merton as a concept symbol across theories of citation; and (3) the Multi-RPYS (“Multi-Referenced Publication Year Spectroscopy”) of the journals Scientometrics, Gene, and Soziale Welt. We show empirically that the measurement of “quality” in terms of citations can further be qualified: short-term citation currency at the research front can be distinguished from longer-term processes of incorporation and codification of knowledge claims into bodies of knowledge. The recently introduced Multi-RPYS can be used to distinguish between short-term and long-term impacts.",1,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1603.html#LeydesdorffBCM16 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2F03f4eca8-bc99-4257-8101-679e3847bf76 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2016.00001/pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2016.00001/full https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/9869584/frma_01_00001.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160308452L/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/42697059 http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/frma.2016.00001/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82838141.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frma.2016.00001,0,,10.3389/frma.2016.00001,2324604439,,001-149-438-140-318; 001-743-448-390-400; 002-257-308-877-076; 004-819-527-814-707; 005-383-744-530-884; 008-196-375-782-618; 008-812-618-060-828; 008-971-809-667-081; 010-387-674-493-027; 010-500-080-787-855; 010-985-966-961-419; 011-225-164-489-559; 012-579-327-956-989; 012-773-811-267-332; 012-904-800-060-915; 013-097-878-014-060; 013-261-296-086-031; 014-523-033-567-291; 015-200-748-525-124; 017-146-468-093-265; 017-349-318-774-487; 018-715-160-937-779; 020-991-085-555-22X; 022-970-333-981-149; 024-525-078-436-940; 025-902-713-334-618; 026-887-181-999-718; 028-593-154-415-675; 029-500-644-026-171; 032-153-706-203-757; 033-053-328-353-077; 033-396-455-592-892; 034-029-221-302-866; 034-145-218-792-807; 034-524-491-899-111; 034-918-096-765-537; 036-859-005-596-594; 037-326-531-131-863; 038-212-076-923-252; 038-686-802-353-990; 039-141-116-831-477; 039-378-579-624-322; 039-947-565-824-427; 042-013-898-883-192; 042-339-259-423-018; 042-498-015-160-117; 043-617-609-965-006; 044-452-670-142-512; 045-905-926-422-741; 046-841-123-880-163; 050-325-823-590-718; 050-342-174-041-587; 051-651-080-617-800; 052-548-921-979-744; 054-432-768-504-213; 056-593-281-338-022; 056-993-526-970-492; 058-394-697-176-814; 060-283-861-180-402; 060-603-591-747-340; 061-957-289-547-350; 063-190-811-897-241; 063-471-207-158-339; 065-565-037-273-800; 068-624-912-307-025; 071-092-418-193-978; 072-084-328-090-162; 073-946-550-452-593; 075-506-421-625-738; 078-797-159-763-204; 080-031-114-197-643; 083-166-570-962-932; 083-597-388-328-649; 083-994-574-833-752; 085-251-380-629-433; 091-821-035-763-964; 096-905-805-346-156; 098-620-354-832-756; 105-402-220-957-576; 107-591-146-740-86X; 112-273-927-082-481; 116-338-013-187-295; 116-545-996-099-174; 117-318-955-712-143; 125-770-941-497-535; 126-436-723-188-040; 134-907-873-325-766; 141-338-037-979-664; 141-493-423-066-820; 142-838-395-521-888; 144-093-209-001-862; 147-199-278-864-535; 148-715-356-765-079; 156-318-982-164-36X; 159-172-726-550-472; 159-620-246-461-047; 161-209-590-737-139; 167-689-186-031-509; 170-336-013-910-948; 173-785-098-742-746; 175-664-767-683-619; 184-714-671-910-337; 191-466-066-542-47X,33

Burns; Anne Blumenthal; Kathleen C. Sitter,"Social media technologies continue to change the academic landscape. Twitter has become particularly popular in research arenas including social work and is being used for fieldwork, knowledge mobilization activities, advocacy, and professional networking. Although there has been some consideration of the benefits and risks of using social media in academia, little has been written from a qualitative social work perspective. Drawing on the example of Twitter, this article redresses this gap in the literature, by exploring how social media is changing the way research is conducted and promoted in relation to (1) measuring scholarly impact via altmetrics; (2) engaging with research participants; (3) networking and making collegial connections; and (4) advocating for social issues in the public realm. As we highlight tensions in each of these four areas, a key concern is how and for whom social media is contributing to the changing meaning of scholarly impact and engagement in research communities.

We can recognize a large amount of exhaustive information about who reads research articles and the contexts in which research articles are read by using data about people who register in Mendeley as readers of articles. The purpose of this paper is to explore different types of users of international Egyptian academic articles indexed in Scopus across four major fields: health sciences, life sciences, physical sciences and social sciences inside and outside academia. The aim is to determine the impact and use of international Egyptian academic articles in Mendeley compared to their citation impact and to explore whether there is any correlation between Mendeley readership counts and the citation indicators for these publications. Furthermore, this study analyses readers’ categories and discovers their country locations according to the data retrieved from Mendeley profiles. The data for this study are collected from the Scopus database. Webometric Analyst 2.0 is used to retrieve Mendeley readership statistics for all collected articles. This information will help in understanding how and to what extent Mendeley readership metrics are applicable in assessing the publications of Egyptian authors and in understanding the usage versus citation pattern and impact of Egyptian scientific outputs on global society. The results indicate that the majority of readers in all disciplines are Ph.D. students, master’s students, and post-graduate students; however, other types of academics are also represented. The findings also indicate that the highest correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts are found for the types of users who frequently author academic papers, except for professors in some sub-disciplines. Regarding country locations, Egyptian international publications are mostly used by users from more than 100 countries worldwide. However, the majority in every field are from the USA. Overall, this study concludes that Egyptian researchers have great international influence on global society. The study suggests that Mendeley readership may reflect usage similarly to conventional citation impacts if the data are limited to readers who are also authors, without the delay of influence measured by citation indicators. Meanwhile, Mendeley data can disclose the invisible impact of research publications, such as educational value for non-author users inside academia or the impact of research papers on practice for users outside academia. Finally, Mendeley readership statistics can reflect the distribution of users in various countries and potential readers worldwide, identify the invisible impact of the research output per country on global society, and be used as a complementary and informative tool for citation databases in explicating the influence of scientific outputs.",121,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v121y2019i1d10.1007_s11192-019-03189-7.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-019-03189-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03189-7,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03189-7,2962857225,,001-479-217-428-264; 002-402-462-805-44X; 003-992-141-082-729; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-011-849-467-618; 023-271-041-203-090; 023-499-397-578-388; 039-033-154-322-624; 040-754-546-913-138; 044-120-876-816-980; 044-288-540-661-670; 051-472-143-393-282; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-808-236-401-052; 057-286-311-076-534; 061-196-034-148-602; 063-006-755-229-923; 069-731-162-859-057; 073-608-394-887-71X; 076-390-069-512-244; 108-107-792-946-829; 121-011-195-507-937; 127-458-994-664-604; 128-149-526-332-454; 131-548-455-537-095; 132-238-138-313-349; 132-946-951-460-277; 143-804-082-399-413; 145-187-636-344-783; 146-046-930-226-363; 162-106-065-447-226; 163-595-480-871-354; 195-502-372-809-145,0

Hemminger; Siluo Yang,"Local altmetrics is currently an integral part of the altmetrics landscape. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of microblog altmetrics of the Chinese microblog platform, Weibo, to shed light on cultural differences and draw attention to local altmetrics in developing countries. The analysis is based on 4.4 million records provided by Altmetric.com. Data collected are from March 2014 to July 2015. It is found that Weibo users discuss global science, more actively compared with several international altmetrics sources. Statistical results show strong evidence of the immediacy advantage of metrics based on Weibo as well as Twitter and the general altmetrics over citations. Distribution of Weibo altmetrics on the article level, source level and discipline level are highly skewed. Overall, compared with Twitter, Weibo altmetrics present similar distributions, with some minor variations. To better understand how and why Weibo users discuss global scientific articles, the top weiboed articles, sources and disciplines are identified and further explored.

This research continues this line of investigations and studies reasons for why some research has received significant online attention in one or both of two social media services; Twitter or Mendeley. This research investigated Finnish researchers’ opinions about the reasons for why their research had received significant online attention and if the attention received could reflect scientific or societal impact of their research. Furthermore it was studied whether the authors of the papers with significant online attention actively followed how their papers were shared or discussed online and if the authors thought that the online attention increased either the scientific or societal impact of their work. Based on the findings it can be stated that the level of online attention received is a sum of many factors and that there are also specific differences between the platforms where the attention has been received. For the articles that had received significant attention on Mendeley the reasons for that attention were more often seen as due to an academic audience, while the situation was reverse on Twitter, with the majority of reasons for the attention being linked to a wider audience. Similar trend could be seen when asked about whether the online attention could reflect scientific or societal impact, although a clear consensus about whether online attention could reflect any type of impact at all could not be reached.",116,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2710-1 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v116y2018i1d10.1007_s11192-018-2710-1.html https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2710-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2710-1,0,,10.1007/s11192-018-2710-1,2790523799,,003-330-836-348-789; 004-924-180-697-031; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-393-512-386-940; 014-173-572-776-423; 018-392-325-202-807; 025-015-884-448-862; 026-365-650-771-727; 028-851-744-069-572; 029-209-501-089-016; 034-264-425-769-847; 040-452-112-976-920; 050-101-745-005-68X; 054-295-263-818-892; 066-507-313-507-599; 072-463-767-991-704; 102-397-529-012-99X; 121-011-195-507-937; 140-578-059-707-826; 140-750-789-105-933; 147-376-549-088-975; 163-591-801-241-575; 177-452-818-527-72X; 192-652-511-528-39X,3

Within this context, data citation is an emergent practice rather than a norm of scholarly attribution. In 2012, a data citation project at Griffith University funded by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) commenced that aimed to: enhance existing infrastructure for data citation at the University; test methodologies for tracking impact; and provide targeted outreach to researchers about the benefits of data citation. The project extended previous collaboration between Griffith and ANDS that built infrastructure at the University to assign DOI names (Digital Object Identifiers) to research data produced by Griffith's researchers.

Es evidente ademas que estos procesos implican la atencion tanto de sus propias dinamicas internas, de tipo conceptual y metodologico, como de las presiones e influencias de otras comunidades academicas. Hoy es evidente la incidencia de las externalidades generadas por estas. Tanto asi que pueden considerarse como productos emergentes de ellas mismas o de las dinamicas de interaccion entre comunidades.; ; A este respecto, han sido varias las editoriales y articulos de revistas top que mencionan la influencia de la financiacion externa, la responsabilidad social, los indices de impacto, conflictos de interes e incluso la influencia de las denominadas redes sociales y academicas sobre los productos y la forma de comunicacion de los mismos (Editorial, 2013, 2014; Piwowar, 2013; Thelwall, Haustein, Lariviere, & Sugimoto, 2013; Van Noorden, 2013). Pero no se limita a un fenomeno posterior a la publicacion sino por el contrario a la generacion misma de las investigaciones.; ; Asi, un ejemplo cercano y tangible esta asociado a los sistemas de incentivos generados por las comunidades que evaluan y controlan la asignacion de recursos para la investigacion que termina por orientar el comportamiento de los investigadores sobre la cantidad, calidad, lugar y tipo de publicacion, generando fuertes conflictos de interes tanto de los investigadores como regulacion social de la investigacion y su difusion (Editorial, 2014). Otro ejemplo es como los sistemas de acreditacion promovieron la explosion de publicaciones para evidenciar la produccion y el compromiso institucional con la investigacion lo cual genero presiones sobre las comunidades academicas para publicar. Dando ademas como resultado diferencias entre sistemas de medicion a nivel internacional, actualmente no existe una homogeneidad entre las medidas de los indices de citacion de Google Scholar, indices de Scopus y el factor de impacto de Thompson Reuters (Bornmann et al., 2009; Silva, 2012).; ; Por algunas de estas razones resulta critico, para salvar unos minimos de calidad de dicha produccion, que los procesos de evaluacion sean exhaustivos, exogamicos y contrastados intersubjetivamente en forma ciega; estas caracteristicas buscan disminuir el efecto de algunas externalidades, por ejemplo, las que surgen de intereses de comunidades con afinidades o que por el contrario compiten o que surgen de comunidades que se oponen en terminos ideologicos, politicos o incluso personales. Esta es la razon por la cual se busca que los pares no conozcan los autores, las instituciones o el pais, o si es asi que el evaluador no sea del mismo lugar (aunque esto es muy dificil de lograr), pero esta tarea se complejiza por cuanto los evaluadores deben contar con experticia tematica similar y con una formacion metodologica solida lo cual no es sencillo de lograr y mas cuando algunas comunidades no se encuentran suficientemente desarrolladas, actualizadas o que han construido lenguajes que solo hablan ellos mismos.; ; Adicionalmente, este problema se complejiza a un mas si le sumamos variables de tipo economico. Los investigadores ganan incentivos por publicacion y los evaluadores no reciben ningun tipo de reconocimiento economico, en la mayoria de los casos. Es entonces evidente que los incentivos juegan como una externalidad a la dinamica academica similar a los intereses politicos, ideologicos e incluso personales. Es un contraste que los equipos editoriales deben tener en cuenta como parte de su proceso de evaluacion.; ; Desafortunadamente, las comunidades academicas en transcurso de consolidacion son mas vulnerables a ajustar sus practicas en funcion de los incentivos o de las externalidades mencionadas, mas aun si dependen de instituciones fragiles. Esta es otra razon que sustenta la necesidad de construir sistemas de evaluacion exogamicos doble ciegos. Este proceso ideal debera complementarse con procesos en los que los formatos de evaluacion e incluso la transparencia de las evaluaciones permitan evidenciar la incidencia de las evaluaciones. Sin embargo esta dinamica no es facil de lograr por cuanto ni evaluadores ni evaluados parecen aun listos para que estos procesos sean completamente transparentes para toda la comunidad, sin embargo, y por proceso de autorregulacion de las practicas cientificas, seguramente en un futuro cercano esto podra lograrse.; ; Quiero senalar finalmente que hoy en dia nadie es ingenuo. Los academicos sabemos el valor de los incentivos; pero lo critico es desdibujar nuestro trabajo en funcion de estos y no de producir conocimiento pertinente, relevante y de calidad, o peor aun, externalizar la responsabilidad en el sistema que solemos criticar cuando solo nosotros somos responsables de las consecuencias derivadas de las decisiones que tomamos como investigadores, evaluadores e incluso como editores. Por algunas de estas razones y por una responsabilidad etica y social debemos hacer visible las implicaciones de las externalidades como tambien del comportamiento de los investigadores y los evaluadores frente a estas.; ; Referencias; ; Bornmann, L., Marx, W., Schier, H., Rahm, E., Thor, A., & Daniel, H.-D.

We crawled Twitter to collect tweets and replies to construct a large number of so-called reply trees, each of which was rooted at a tweet and joined by replies. Consistent with the previous literature, we found that the empirical trees were characterized by some long path-like reply trees, large star-like trees, and long irregular trees, although their frequencies were not high. We tested several branching process models to explain the empirical frequency of these types of reply trees as well as more basic quantities such as the distributions of the size and depth of the reply tree. Based on our modeling results, we suggest that the in-degree of the tweet that initiates a reply tree (i.e., the number of times that the tweet is directly mentioned by other reply posts) may play an important role in forming the global shape of the reply tree.",6,,,https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/81189557/art_3A10.1007_2Fs13278_016_0334_0.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-016-0334-0 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/reply-trees-in-twitter(f2712c74-9c93-4668-a026-320b68f843b9).html https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/81189557/art_3A10.1007_2Fs13278_016_0334_0.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/73983444 https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/reply-trees-in-twitter(f2712c74-9c93-4668-a026-320b68f843b9).html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-016-0334-0 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73983444.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13278-016-0334-0,0,,10.1007/s13278-016-0334-0,2370264397,,003-252-133-044-155; 005-551-240-290-389; 005-788-491-757-196; 006-485-721-004-172; 007-648-770-491-819; 009-332-452-622-037; 009-575-932-931-599; 010-620-065-338-644; 011-440-664-122-077; 014-886-947-284-178; 018-550-403-684-524; 019-116-190-855-557; 019-203-243-369-372; 019-253-324-285-803; 020-954-690-005-08X; 026-581-909-826-261; 027-991-394-082-053; 028-104-394-721-639; 028-949-639-640-920; 029-649-122-375-468; 030-261-141-295-070; 032-795-508-739-379; 034-531-663-629-501; 037-467-427-526-653; 038-516-989-964-123; 043-182-743-270-651; 045-741-521-444-59X; 046-914-739-399-516; 051-107-006-317-00X; 052-870-044-955-956; 057-040-097-643-496; 064-147-920-650-355; 066-507-313-507-599; 068-958-908-040-874; 070-182-114-671-785; 071-677-574-507-67X; 071-744-514-511-850; 074-165-384-229-445; 079-867-032-742-606; 086-840-457-207-485; 090-080-258-935-135; 097-517-894-990-702; 099-797-855-536-680; 112-945-394-163-527; 124-563-581-974-925; 132-780-404-117-931; 140-679-312-461-034; 143-919-571-232-761; 147-096-933-427-955; 152-483-638-552-48X; 156-732-247-833-751; 163-637-734-144-951; 164-710-556-206-666; 182-940-361-741-198; 197-343-264-064-243,14

However, much of the current literature speculates about how academic librarians are using and implementing research impact indicators in their practice. METHODS This study analyzed the results from a 2015 survey administered to over 13,000 academic librarians at Carnegie-classified R1 institutions in the United States. The survey concentrated on academic librarians’ familiarity with and usage of research impact indicators. Results: This study uncovered findings related to academic librarians’ various levels of familiarity with research impact indicators and how they implement and use research impact indicators in their professional development and in their library job duties. DISCUSSION In general, academic librarians with regular scholarly communication support duties tend to have higher levels of familiarity of research impact indicators. In general, academic librarians are most familiar with the citation counts and usage statistics and least familiar with altmetrics. During consultations with faculty, the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and citation counts are more likely to be addressed than the author h-index, altmetrics, qualitative measures, and expert peer reviews. The survey results also hint towards a growing interest in altmetrics among academic librarians for their professional advancement. CONCLUSION Academic librarians are continually challenged to keep pace with the changing landscape of research impact metrics and research assessment models. By keeping pace and implementing research impact indicators in their own practices, academic librarians can provide a crucial service to the wider academic community.",6,,,https://jlsc-pub.org/articles/abstract/10.7710/2162-3309.2212/,http://dx.doi.org/10.7710/2162-3309.2212,0,,10.7710/2162-3309.2212,2884852125,,,0

Chan,"Objective In 2015 and 2016, the Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine (CJEM) Social Media (SoMe) Team collaborated with established medical websites to promote CJEM articles using podcasts and infographics while tracking dissemination and readership. Methods CJEM publications in the “Original Research” and “State of the Art” sections were selected by the SoMe Team for podcast and infographic promotion based on their perceived interest to emergency physicians. A control group was composed retrospectively of articles from the 2015 and 2016 issues with the highest Altmetric score that received standard Facebook and Twitter promotions. Studies on SoMe topics were excluded. Dissemination was quantified by January 1, 2017 Altmetric scores. Readership was measured by abstract and full-text views over a 3-month period. The number needed to view (NNV) was calculated by dividing abstract views by full-text views. Results Twenty-nine of 88 articles that met inclusion were included in the podcast (6), infographic (11), and control (12) groups. Descriptive statistics (mean, 95% confidence interval) were calculated for podcast (Altmetric: 61, 42-80; Abstract: 1795, 1135-2455; Full-text: 431, 0-1031), infographic (Altmetric: 31.5, 19-43; Abstract: 590, 361-819; Full-text: 65, 33-98), and control (Altmetric: 12, 8-15; Abstract: 257, 159-354; Full-Text: 73, 38-109) articles. The NNV was 4.2 for podcast, 9.0 for infographic, and 3.5 for control articles. Discussion Limitations included selection bias, the influence of SoMe promotion on the Altmetric scores, and a lack of generalizability to other journals. Conclusion Collaboration with established SoMe websites using podcasts and infographics was associated with increased Altmetric scores and abstract views but not full-text article views.",20,Canada; Emergency Medicine/methods; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Journal Impact Factor; Social Media,,http://pubmed.cn/28899440 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-emergency-medicine/article/impact-of-social-media-promotion-with-infographics-and-podcasts-on-research-dissemination-and-readership/8BB62C39F4957E5E14E2E31E69077756 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28899440,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cem.2017.394,0,28899440,10.1017/cem.2017.394,2756309993,,005-405-917-232-469; 007-367-468-588-272; 009-313-180-544-982; 011-950-546-289-132; 015-257-833-076-631; 020-030-162-721-162; 024-488-416-889-150; 030-879-685-460-892; 031-180-419-408-183; 035-719-694-197-722; 037-024-042-313-961; 038-537-534-455-560; 041-186-170-063-182; 043-110-688-772-786; 043-295-121-841-860; 048-284-162-273-140; 059-416-778-825-610; 060-613-045-792-354; 061-875-362-869-155; 061-900-019-279-336; 066-647-165-698-171; 071-123-245-005-332; 076-959-446-478-234; 077-641-194-278-899; 087-403-009-188-672; 091-794-159-579-826; 102-973-599-213-44X; 110-720-595-631-817; 116-705-798-980-710; 127-126-210-218-745,21

Rhee,"As the editor, I have the honor and pleasure of reading and reviewing the best manuscripts in the discipline of facial plastic surgery. I am often asked the questions by potential authors: “What is JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery looking for in an article? What are the factors in deciding which articles are accepted for publication?” I have pointed to my inaugural editorial1 that describes ourmissionandvision statement that articulates 3 key themes—showcasing the best science, educating our targeted readership, and framing the contemporary and key issues of our time. However, I’ve often wondered if there was a more concise or visually crisp way to articulate mymessage. Now, fortunately, through the creativity of our web and media team, the new JAMA Network article dashboard captures theessenceofwhatour journaldesires—that is, “thehighimpact article”—the number of citations, number of downloads, and altmetric score (Figure). These 3 metrics are not all-inclusiveor all thatmatters, but theydo represent the3distinct themes I’vementioned:metrics thatmake an article desirable from a journal perspective. The citation metric is one that is likely most familiar and recognizedby thescientific community.Therearemetrics such asH-index for authors (basedonnumberof citations andpublications) that are used by academic institutions as one consideration in faculty promotion decisions. Impact factors for journals are calculated by counting all of the citations to every article published in a journal divided by the number of “substantial” articles (original research, long reviews, special communications) published in that specific journal during the 2precedingyears.This2-yearwindowisadifficultone formore clinically based journals like JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery because even landmark clinical studies or reviews often experience a lag in terms of its citation frequency as opposed to basic sciencearticles that tendtobecitedmore frequentlysince the knowledge and reporting cycle runs on a faster pace. On ourwebsite, “themost cited” recentlypublishedarticle is a review on complications related to injectable soft-tissue filler (>3400 views, 16 citations, altmetric score of 3).2 Whatelse is important forarticleselectionsbeyondthepossibility of an article being cited? Readership interest is another key component, with number of recent article downloads being a metric that describes this factor. This may be a scientific article (often clinical science) or an educationally focused article—for example, an in-depth topic review, surgical vignette, or an opinion piece. On our website the “most read” (ie, downloaded) article in the past 31 days is a fulllength clinical article on the topic of thread-lift complications (>23 000 views, 2 citations, altmetric score of 9).3 However, even the short educational piece (a Surgical Pearl) by Chu and Davis4 that was published online as recently as May 15, 2015,4 has close to 1100 views.

The aim of the model is to use several scalar indices at the same time for giving a measure of the impact of a given source of information, that is, we construct vector valued indices. We use the properties of these vector valued indices in order to give a global answer to the problem of finding the optimal scalar index for measuring a particular aspect of the impact of an information source, depending on the criterion we want to fix for the evaluation of this impact. The main restrictions of our model are (1) it uses finite sets of scalar impact indices (altmetrics), and (2) these indices are assumed to be additive. The optimization procedure for finding the best tool for a fixed criterion is also presented.

Sadly, in many respects, science has evolved from an exploratory model to a business model. It has become, in many instances, the verification tool for technologies, products and innovations that then establish corporate profits. Firstly, science evolved from being a relatively financially conflict-free zone of independent intellectual achievement where intellectual centers provided the necessary grants to complete basic research, to an important evaluation tool for so many products in our modern globalized societies (1). Secondly, scientists have implicitly evolved, or have had to evolve, from mere information seekers with a nerdy image in society, to important marketing agents of what they produce and discover. Pure science is becoming extinct because science is being treated as a marketing tool and driven by society’s demands. Information and intellect are copyrighted or patented, big data, peer review and open access are increasingly commercialized, and knowledge is no longer free to create, or divulge. When science is not driven by real academic and intellectual incentives, but instead by false incentives, this promotes an ambience of false discovery, or cheating. It also introduces business- and marketing-like values such as political correctness, and thus a considerably cold state of apathy, into academia. In the modern publishing era, metrics, which have zero academic value, but have tremendous marketing value for publishers, have come to dominate academics, and the altmetrics trend is not abating (2,3).",2,,,http://amj.amegroups.com/article/view/3698,http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/amj.2017.02.10,0,,10.21037/amj.2017.02.10,2594476384,,,15

First Published January 18, 2017 Research Article PDF download for A moral profession Article Information Article has an altmetric score of 2 Full Access Abstract Background: Lack of compassion is claimed to result in poor and sometimes harmful nursing care. Developing strategies to encourage compassionate caring behaviours are important because there is evidence to suggest a connection between having a moral orientation such as compassion and resulting caring behaviour in practice. Objective: This study aimed to articulate a clearer understanding of compassionate caring via nurse educators’ selection and use of published texts and film. Methodology: This study employed discourse analysis. Participants and research context: A total of 41 nurse educators working in universities in the United Kingdom (n = 3), Ireland (n = 1) and Canada (n = 1) completed questionnaires on the narratives that shaped their understanding of care and compassion. Findings: The desire to understand others and how to care compassionately characterised educators’ choices. Most narratives were examples of kindness and compassion. A total of 17 emphasised the importance of connecting with others as a central component of compassionate caring, 10 identified the burden of caring, 24 identified themes of abandonment and of failure to see the suffering person and 15 narratives showed a discourse of only showing compassion to those ‘deserving’ often understood as the suffering person doing enough to help themselves. Discussion: These findings are mostly consistent with work in moral philosophy emphasising the particular or context and perception or vision as well as the necessity of emotions. The narratives themselves are used by nurse educators to help explicate examples of caring and compassion (or its lack). Conclusion: To feel cared about people need to feel ‘visible’ as though they matter. Nurses need to be alert to problems that may arise if their ‘moral vision’ is influenced by ideas of desert and how much the patient is doing to help himself or herself.",26,"Canada; Empathy; Faculty, Nursing/psychology; Humans; Ireland; Personal Narratives as Topic; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom",,https://openresearch.lsbu.ac.uk/item/870w6 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0969733016687163?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R https://core.ac.uk/display/96599384,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0969733016687163,0,28095762,10.1177/0969733016687163,2576915937; 2803299968,,001-716-696-872-552; 004-383-890-291-774; 009-441-567-096-789; 010-454-600-738-834; 010-540-465-216-718; 016-393-383-933-159; 017-827-609-120-209; 019-923-011-937-073; 021-693-568-676-449; 023-301-673-251-191; 025-890-524-106-346; 026-952-714-154-282; 032-844-022-663-093; 037-916-131-024-911; 045-981-703-407-661; 058-504-808-015-373; 066-699-003-659-588; 072-135-239-589-815; 072-849-316-750-719; 074-751-004-849-872; 075-449-673-591-943; 079-000-656-820-156; 080-795-297-199-210; 084-307-957-223-862; 089-265-780-554-779; 096-935-246-557-850; 104-858-176-565-725; 112-262-348-514-688; 141-636-021-972-500; 159-935-273-152-967; 166-412-225-137-747; 166-801-315-837-623; 180-285-878-729-385; 181-922-232-561-11X; 190-621-201-062-526; 198-748-407-285-345,1

This article examines surveillance and transparency not as a dichotomy but as a constitutive relation in the field of academia, focusing specifically on ranking and rivalry in the context of competitive performance. Transparency-as-openness (open access platforms) is enmeshed in enclosures assembled from (self-) surveillance, personal data, public institutions and private enterprise. The analysis pays particular attention to how altmetrics and credibility metrics – used to enhance personal prestige and professional standing – reinforce the neo-liberalisation of higher education. The article concludes by engaging critically with the politics and poetics of open enclosures with a view to re-imagining the practice of academic freedom.",9,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2158379X.2016.1191162 https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/5888,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2158379x.2016.1191162,0,,10.1080/2158379x.2016.1191162,2443363264,,005-630-358-001-699; 007-053-357-467-476; 007-576-797-510-987; 009-229-876-956-617; 010-293-806-592-055; 021-205-207-256-208; 027-564-158-388-994; 030-008-836-865-931; 032-211-861-218-927; 033-045-004-713-03X; 035-026-984-742-74X; 035-639-965-197-274; 038-921-100-788-962; 042-528-201-912-583; 044-536-362-052-353; 046-634-121-220-207; 048-837-685-374-407; 054-684-699-425-204; 055-936-477-486-305; 056-620-266-033-125; 057-244-652-866-221; 061-557-853-923-28X; 065-933-506-504-621; 068-824-654-295-258; 068-973-460-794-189; 098-668-814-439-246; 107-325-300-915-006; 117-475-942-690-466; 120-238-960-087-256; 120-853-830-705-487; 121-697-140-719-974; 125-409-621-805-650; 128-157-059-873-293; 128-540-431-577-928; 131-544-409-728-415; 136-499-916-220-749; 143-394-767-608-995; 146-707-890-584-232; 155-498-723-977-969; 157-555-837-431-172; 157-761-122-323-466; 159-070-028-372-704; 170-316-284-930-061; 189-129-174-072-285; 191-531-952-974-320,1

While for a small group both concepts are clearly different, a large part of the community tends to regard usage metrics as a subset of altmetrics. From our point of view this use of terminology is not appropriate, and can easily lead to unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings reflected in a distorted scientific communication. In what follows we will argue why a distinction should be made between the two terms ‘usage metrics’ and ‘altmetrics’. The main reason is of historical nature. Usage metrics have already been around much longer than altmetrics. In fact, usage metrics are even older than citation metrics, because librarians have been tracking usage since the beginning of their profession, ranging from basic user surveys to the usage tracking of physical journal issues and monographs to library loan statistics to the sophisticated analysis of e-media usage (e-metrics). There is an abundance of statistics and models on library-related usage data, based on different sampling techniques, cumbersome procedures or comprehensive methods of gathering usage data for all subscribed publication types (Coombs 2005; Kraemer 2006; Franklin et al. 2009).",102,,,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2739323 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1472-7 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-014-1472-7 https://hungary.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/usage-metrics-versus-altmetrics-confusing-terminology https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-014-1472-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1472-7,0,,10.1007/s11192-014-1472-7,2035078458,,000-827-073-807-610; 002-181-962-982-139; 002-257-308-877-076; 003-168-179-893-142; 003-466-511-560-944; 005-699-111-606-288; 006-018-730-429-356; 010-261-691-530-826; 011-947-051-045-147; 013-784-101-759-105; 014-605-846-064-279; 015-015-566-727-417; 017-807-134-822-38X; 027-205-205-984-47X; 044-832-309-154-947; 044-939-394-642-346; 044-959-160-435-748; 059-866-766-621-846; 068-624-912-307-025; 069-649-792-713-64X; 074-754-102-682-192; 090-514-459-035-016; 093-435-330-781-724; 094-408-168-535-826; 096-701-129-539-803; 099-816-321-816-355; 110-580-969-132-595; 123-687-398-098-005; 124-490-028-694-122; 174-486-809-798-700; 195-093-304-251-835,32

The citation counts obtained through Google Scholar (GS) and the altmetrics data obtained from Dspace on the North-West University institutional repository are used to determine these impacts. Further, the conversion rates of ETDs from an educational output into an academic research output are determined using data from GS and the North-West University institutional repository. The results show that the 612 theses and dissertations attracted 931 citations which translates to 1.52 citations per thesis on average. A total of 41.2% theses and dissertations received at least one citation and the conversion rate into academic research output was 16.8%.

In his article, “Citation Indexes for Science: A New Dimension in Documentation Through Association of Ideas,”1 he proposed what would become the Science Citation Index, offering academic journals an Impact Factor (IF) to gauge the importance of their published research.; ; As I sit here on my MacBook Air in 2014 hearing the ping of new emails and the ding of incoming texts while reading Garfield’s article, which describes early tools like Shepard’s Citations developed in 1873,1 I’m struck by how far we’ve come in 60 years. I think it’s fair to say that prior to drafting a new manuscript, most authors will scour the literature, research via PubMed and PubMed Central, and Google search for redundancy to their own proposed work, asking questions such as: Has someone already tackled this problem? Who was it? When was it? How is my work (potentially) better or more novel? What can I add to the academic literature to justify the publication of this work? The days of singularly consulting print volumes are behind us—the “digital generation” has thrust itself upon us all.; ; The importance of the IF as a measurement tool cannot be overstated, and we believe in its validity as a gauge to monitor the performance and success of the Aesthetic Surgery Journal ( ASJ ). We will continue our efforts to focus on high-impact articles that will improve the IF score.

These impact measures also known as bibliometric indicators are limited to the academic community and cannot provide the broad perspective of research impact in public, government or business. The understanding that scholarly impact outside scientific and academic sphere has given rise to an area of scientometrics called alternative metrics or “altmetrics.” Moreover, researchers in this area incline to center around gauging scientific activity via social media, namely Twitter. However, these count-based measurements of impact are sensitive to gaming as they lack concrete references to the primary source. In this work, we expand a conventional citation graph to a heterogeneous graph of publications, scientists, venues, organizations based on more reliable social media sources such as mainstream news and weblogs. Our method is composed of two components: the first one is combining the bibliometric data with social media data like blogs and mainstream news. The second component investigates how standard graph-based metrics can be applied to a heterogeneous graph to predict the academic impact. Our result showed moderate correlations and positive associations between the computed graph-based metrics with academic impact and also reasonably predict the academic impact of researchers.",7,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-017-0466-x https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/7390,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13278-017-0466-x,0,,10.1007/s13278-017-0466-x,2763633408,,001-310-713-901-731; 002-257-308-877-076; 002-541-304-332-19X; 003-106-377-991-903; 003-498-582-546-038; 003-840-549-027-309; 005-278-577-590-526; 005-657-459-454-849; 010-918-932-001-620; 018-025-399-192-993; 019-684-018-548-024; 028-987-648-351-407; 031-998-714-163-490; 033-436-041-618-363; 033-852-335-746-849; 034-220-390-464-597; 035-784-414-732-681; 035-964-848-340-165; 037-772-356-763-328; 038-046-756-154-02X; 046-072-700-614-970; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-311-090-049-993; 052-131-519-754-594; 052-661-260-055-265; 053-086-790-955-429; 053-142-487-981-740; 055-840-426-103-857; 057-228-216-544-728; 057-286-311-076-534; 061-599-718-460-193; 064-446-622-130-298; 066-507-313-507-599; 085-001-502-383-40X; 089-914-448-038-331; 090-075-808-927-484; 094-700-548-381-732; 096-546-585-695-802; 113-688-815-279-731; 119-573-350-073-861; 121-011-195-507-937; 128-129-106-162-85X; 130-723-951-119-449; 141-134-741-084-026; 142-048-401-047-531; 149-449-384-202-908; 170-590-614-785-576; 174-619-377-275-100; 175-940-209-265-576; 188-006-649-973-495; 192-130-814-634-01X,4

It is an exciting time to be involved in the field since there are so many opportunities to contribute in innovative ways. We develop altmetrics tools and related services at Altmetric LLP, a small London-based start-up founded in 2011 [1]. Like all developers of new altmetrics tools, we frequently encounter challenges in defining what should be measured, accurately collecting attention from disparate sources and making sense of the huge amount of compiled data. We outline five of these challenges in this piece, illustrating them with examples from our experience. It is worth noting that the altmetrics community as a whole comes together regularly to discuss these and other issues, with two open workshops held in 2012 and more planned for the future.",39,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390410/epdf https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fbult.2013.1720390410 http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean_Liu/publication/237079826_Five_Challenges_in_Altmetrics_A_Toolmaker%27s_Perspective/links/00b7d51b5e155bbd8d000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_Liu_Adie.pdf http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean_Liu/publication/237079826_Five_Challenges_in_Altmetrics_A_Toolmaker%27s_Perspective/links/00b7d51b5e155bbd8d000000.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390410,0,,10.1002/bult.2013.1720390410,2055518380; 2915005792,,110-457-195-877-695; 112-940-088-541-54X; 141-134-741-084-026,37

The Web of Science’s (WoS) Incites Essential Science Indicator (ESI) database was used to extract the metrics of HCPs while the online portal altmetric.com was used to obtain the altmetrics data for each HCP. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between citation data and altmetrics of the HCPs. The results indicate that clinical medicine posted the highest number of HCPs but was behind Space Science and Molecular Biology & Genetics in terms of citations per paper. Only six fields recorded more than 100 HCPs. Overall, South Africa’s HCPs have the highest altmetrics presence in Dimensions followed by Mendeley, Twitter, Facebook, News Outlets and Blogs.

HIRMEOS, H igh I ntegration of R esearch M onographs in the E uropean O pen S cience infrastructure, is a 30-month EU-funded project and tackles the main obstacles of the full integration of important platforms supporting open access monographs and their contents. HIRMEOS will work on innovative services on identification, entities recognition, annotation, and altmetrics, using when possible common standards. These standards are well established in journal publishing, however not common enough yet in book publishing to pave the way for deeper linking of book and journal content or crosslinking of references, entities or usage. HIRMEOS is based upon 5 Open Access book-publishing platforms, OpenEdition Books, OAPEN Library, EKT Open Book Press, Ubiquity Press and Gottingen University Press. During the run of the project these platforms integrate tools for identification, authentication and interoperability (DOI, ORCID, Fundref), for additional information and entity extraction (INRIA (N)ERD), the ability to annotate monographs (Hypothes.is), and gather usage and alternative metric data. HIRMEOS will also enrich the technical capacities of the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB), a most significant indexing service for open access monographs globally, to receive automated information for ingestion, while it will also develop a structured certification system to document monograph peer-review.  The project consortium will develop shared minimum standards for their monograph publications, such that allow the full embedding of technologies and content in the European Science Cloud. Finally, the project will have a catalyst effect in including more disciplines into the Open Science paradigm, widening its boundaries towards the SSH.

The literature is discussed in relation to the possible use of altmetrics in research evaluation. Since the research was particularly interested in the correlation between altmetrics counts and citation counts, this overview focuses particularly on this correlation. For each altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its correlation with traditional citation counts. As the results of the meta-analyses show, the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging counts is negligible (pooled r = 0.003), for blog counts it is small (pooled r = 0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, medium to large (CiteULike pooled r = 0.23; Mendeley pooled r = 0.51).",103,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-015-1565-y http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1407.html#Bornmann14e https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v103y2015i3d10.1007_s11192-015-1565-y.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-015-1565-y https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2780182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-015-1565-y,0,,10.1007/s11192-015-1565-y,2142756309,,000-529-212-070-79X; 001-702-591-626-614; 003-075-869-802-612; 004-029-858-501-784; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-011-849-467-618; 007-479-712-420-399; 008-467-761-400-720; 008-784-377-734-821; 009-865-709-406-084; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-387-674-493-027; 010-537-281-905-239; 015-700-245-441-595; 015-828-855-411-513; 016-715-045-833-488; 016-800-190-255-14X; 020-525-285-809-839; 024-417-271-229-398; 025-704-627-779-867; 026-690-594-587-368; 029-322-655-785-959; 032-589-385-527-212; 034-737-120-920-806; 036-942-477-913-970; 038-688-190-541-526; 040-452-112-976-920; 042-197-800-455-915; 046-850-691-447-936; 047-436-441-352-101; 049-416-575-390-503; 049-905-673-769-223; 050-252-270-491-60X; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 058-250-838-222-405; 063-510-561-434-972; 064-420-766-656-39X; 064-464-535-000-515; 064-509-241-094-364; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-897-343-637-16X; 068-224-488-858-924; 070-237-694-868-044; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-751-303-826-167; 078-082-517-555-79X; 080-120-317-309-996; 082-886-915-862-283; 086-809-706-245-39X; 090-741-145-756-363; 091-943-792-747-422; 093-004-530-053-970; 097-560-061-216-214; 099-816-321-816-355; 102-161-046-039-361; 102-276-478-923-871; 105-402-220-957-576; 105-408-446-496-845; 115-763-857-721-997; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 126-062-861-008-278; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-098-062-346-311; 130-564-902-288-355; 135-882-345-041-290; 139-651-430-124-012; 141-134-741-084-026; 143-488-955-076-815; 144-767-338-197-935; 159-670-771-461-972; 179-223-065-594-04X,81

For some, this announcement will be big news, as the scientific community is increasingly locked into a hate-love relationship with this journal metric. Some researchers use it to decide which journal to submit to, readers may use it to decide which papers to read in a long list of search results, and new journals await eagerly to see what kind of ranking they will get as a means to establish their reputation and credibility. In addition, despite widespread recognition that a journal IF is not a valid or appropriate metric for evaluating individual researchers, some funding and tenure committees may look to it in assessing the value of a candidate’s publication record. Discussion of this type of misuse of the IF has been brewing for some time. In fact, Thomson Reuters stated as far back as 2008 that, “Perhaps the most prominent misuse of the Journal Impact Factor is its misapplication to draw conclusions about the performance of an individual researcher.” We the editors at Cell Press wholeheartedly agree, and so do all of the scientists that we speak to. Yet, 5 years after the index creators themselves implored the scientific community not to use IFs to assess individual scientists for promotion, hiring, and funding decisions, the practice persists. Why is that, and what can we do as a community to effect change?As many of you may know, last month, a number of journals, publishers, scientists, and funders signed and published the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), outlining again the limitations and abuses of IFs and calling for specific actions by stakeholders throughout the scientific community. Although Cell Press declined to sign DORA because there were specific calls to action that we did not feel we could endorse as constructive and appropriate measures, we support the goals of DORA and add our voices and actions to bringing about change in how individual scientists are assessed for hiring, promotion, and tenure.The assessment of science and scientists requires a multidimensional approach. Sadly for everyone who sits on study sections and promotion/hiring committees confronted with large numbers of applicants, there are no shortcuts. Many and arguably the most important of those dimensions are impossible to “metricize,” including the candidate’s track record of making valuable contributions to the advance of research (in terms of both publications and reagents, techniques, and data sets), the creativity of their forward-looking research agenda, the “reach” of their work into adjacent disciplines, their ability to mentor early-career scientists and educate students, their fit within the department, their integrity, and their ability to collaborate effectively. There are no numbers for these.So how do editors think about IFs, and what role do they play in deciding what a journal will publish? Probably to most scientists’ surprise, we do not think about IFs on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. Of course, we would like the work that we publish to garner significant attention from the scientific community and be a cornerstone on which subsequent science builds. Typically, this means we would like, as we expect the authors would, that many people read the papers we publish, are inspired by them to consider new avenues in their own research, and therefore cite the papers in their own work. To the degree that this creates a high IF, we are pleased when our IF is high or growing. But first and foremost, our goal is to provide a fast, informed, and rigorous review process that successfully identifies findings that change the way we understand and think about biological processes to create a journal of interest and value to our readers. We publish papers that fulfill this primary objective even if we suspect that that those papers may not be highly cited. By taking this approach, we believe that we add value to underrepresented or under-cited fields by maintaining the breadth of scope of our journals and by bringing work that may otherwise be considered of niche interest to the attention of a wider audience.At a broader level, can any single journal metric, such as the IF, be a valuable or meaningful piece of data on its own? Probably not. Thomson Reuters also supplies a range of other citation-based metrics, including the immediacy index to capture the timeliness of a journal’s impact by measuring same-year citations, the citation half-life to measure the “posterity factor” of a journal, and a 5-year impact factor to give a longer-term measure of the citation activity of a journal’s content. In addition, alternative metrics such as the Eigenfactor, SNIP, and SCIMAGO are all designed to provide different and more nuanced views of journal citation performance based on sophisticated algorithms that take into account a variety of factors. The relative “scores” for journals vary depending on the particular metric. Nevertheless, while very few scientists can quote the immediacy indices, Eigenfactors, or SCIMAGO scores of journals, they often know the IFs. Why is that? How was it decided that the 2-year citation metric is the one meaningful metric that dominates all others? Perhaps it is because there is an intuitive ease about IFs and a 2-year window “feels” right in balancing enough time for other scientists to build on the work and publish without creating too much of a delay in assessing impact. Perhaps it is because of Thomson Reuters’ active and selective marketing of IFs over its other metrics. No one can really say, but it is clear that, although the expediency and objectivity that metrics provide can be appealing and each measure may be valid on its own, to capture the multidimensional value and quality of a journal, any assessment needs to involve a panel of measures that capture different aspects of impact.In support of this ongoing trend, Cell Press will change how we inform the scientific community about our impact factors and will place them in the context of multiple metrics. Several months ago, we added article-level altmetrics to our site so that readers can track the real-time community response to individual papers. In addition, search results on our site include citation information based on Scopus data. When considering this overall array of information, it is important to keep in mind that article-level metrics and measures of social media buzz are just as subject to bias and error as journal-level metrics. Individual articles with relatively few citations/downloads/Facebook Likes published in high-quality journals should not be viewed as “mistakes” or as making a limited contribution to the field. These papers met a very high editorial standard for changing the way that we think about an important biological problem and went through a rigorous peer review evaluation. Some important questions capture the attention of only a small number of researchers, perhaps because they are ideas ahead of their time or require expertise in new technologies; others spark contributions from many labs. As a result, some fields naturally have more active citation patterns than others, but that difference is not a reflection of the interest or importance of the work. We as editors know perhaps better than anyone that this year’s citation sleeper can be a Nobel Prize winner 10 years down the road. We are careful to judge the papers we publish based on the science and not on measures of popularity like citations and downloads, and we encourage readers, funders, and search committees to do the same. So, as the buzz over this month’s IF news comes and goes, we, the editors at Cell Press, will continue focusing on the things that we know are truly important, like exciting, compelling science and talking to authors and reviewers, and we will remember that any rating is just a rating.",154,Cell Biology; Editorial Policies; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Science; Workforce,,http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(13)00756-3 https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(13)00756-3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23806748 https://core.ac.uk/display/82065593 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82065593.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.017,0,23806748,10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.017,2053117771,,,0

The results show that 35.6% of news in Altmetric.com are not accessible and 28.9% of blog mentions in PlumX point to a broken link. These worrying percentages of broken links are due, mainly, to the employment of third parties to supply news and blog events. Altmetric.com is the service that provides a better-balanced distribution of events, while PlumX and CED group their events around the last two years.

This is evident as books in pure sciences were more frequently cited, books in medicine received more social media attentions and engineering books had the highest download counts and Mendeley bookmarks. The results also demonstrated that Crossref citations and SpringerLink downloads correlated significantly in all four disciplines indicating books with more download statistics also accumulated higher citation counts. The study is significant to provide evidence that alternative sources such as usage-based and social media-based metrics could act as complement to traditional citation-based measures for assessing the impact of books and/or book chapters in a multidimensional way.",121,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-019-03198-6 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v121y2019i1d10.1007_s11192-019-03198-6.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03198-6,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03198-6,2964408953,,000-792-009-951-071; 001-731-506-576-898; 003-168-179-893-142; 005-699-111-606-288; 008-998-283-383-315; 017-349-318-774-487; 018-590-173-884-235; 019-549-905-486-905; 026-537-583-432-28X; 028-948-405-834-39X; 030-074-128-354-124; 033-812-042-547-196; 035-988-212-620-838; 038-972-526-389-790; 039-364-388-904-391; 041-719-557-885-294; 054-221-810-321-366; 056-764-246-223-493; 057-286-311-076-534; 065-813-744-561-991; 066-507-313-507-599; 072-463-767-991-704; 076-399-144-464-512; 080-980-582-763-540; 083-304-448-410-627; 085-211-231-477-329; 086-922-363-187-339; 096-438-024-010-035; 126-062-861-008-278; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-023-687-952-657; 139-605-789-723-604; 154-970-386-977-473; 174-743-361-740-440,0

It studies to what extent these indicators, gained from academic sites, can provide a proxy for research impact. Close to 10,000 author profiles belonging to the Spanish National Research Council were extracted from the principal scholarly social sites: ResearchGate, Academia.edu and Mendeley and academic search engines: Microsoft Academic Search and Google Scholar Citations. Results describe little overlapping between sites because most of the researchers only manage one profile (72%). Correlations point out that there is scant relationship between altmetric and bibliometric indicators at author level. This is due to the almetric ones are site-dependent, while the bibliometric ones are more stable across web sites. It is concluded that altmetrics could reflect an alternative dimension of the research performance, close, perhaps, to science popularization and networking abilities, but far from citation impact.",9,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:infome:v:9:y:2015:i:1:p:39-49 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157714000984 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.11.004 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v9y2015i1p39-49.html http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157714000984 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.11.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.11.004,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2014.11.004,1982015285,,003-186-877-439-974; 003-477-217-495-188; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-011-849-467-618; 008-150-591-136-318; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-813-208-836-925; 019-457-587-825-722; 020-647-409-662-919; 022-783-973-655-305; 036-476-020-758-151; 036-909-353-190-796; 039-862-058-538-423; 040-488-956-243-553; 044-495-558-344-456; 048-879-639-283-972; 050-252-270-491-60X; 056-278-133-462-97X; 066-507-313-507-599; 068-359-236-592-830; 075-267-966-095-209; 078-277-775-662-483; 079-526-559-966-651; 085-278-076-814-028; 086-809-706-245-39X; 096-651-981-739-023; 099-816-321-816-355; 102-276-478-923-871; 106-380-847-894-830; 109-600-459-987-999; 117-472-869-381-363; 122-020-099-723-788; 122-073-156-920-876; 123-687-398-098-005; 126-075-431-794-849; 127-458-994-664-604; 132-626-974-159-177; 141-134-741-084-026; 149-661-584-078-911; 154-016-219-227-690; 165-920-479-435-298,71

Altmetric Explorer was selected as an altmetrics harvesting tool. The search in Altmetric Explorer yielded 66,608 research outputs from 118 nursing journals. The articles with the top 100 altmetric attention score (AAS) were identified and a new search, limited to only those 100 articles, was run to produce aggregate metrics specific to those articles.

The articles were mostly discussed on Twitter, followed by news outlets and Mendeley. Articles indexed in the nursing journals category attracted low online attention compared with articles published in other health journal categories. Twitter remained the dominant source of attention over the years 2012-2018, followed distantly by news outlets. Most online attention came from the USA and the UK. Of the top 100 articles included in the study, the Journal of Advanced Nursing published the highest number of articles (N = 26; Median AAS = 179). The AAS was not significantly different between articles published in Q1 journals and those published in Q2 and Q3 journals. There was a significant relationship between articles' AASs and their citation counts on Scopus and Web of Science. Publication date was significantly related to citation counts on Scopus and Web of Science but not with AASs.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Altmetrics will likely continue to evolve alongside the rapidly expanding use of social media and online platforms. As nursing continues to strive to have our research and scholarship inform policy, translated into practice and recognized for its scientific merit, we have to remain vigilant about the best ways to disseminate the important work we are doing. Research, such as this study, will allow nursing scholars to benchmark our progress as we adapt to the changing environment for measuring impact and quality in the digital age.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation>",75,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jan.13921 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30507052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jan.13921,0,30507052,10.1111/jan.13921,2902158403,,000-529-212-070-79X; 001-788-981-268-621; 002-666-995-736-984; 007-205-762-763-201; 007-359-816-909-053; 009-865-709-406-084; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-493-707-773-877; 015-270-923-005-163; 021-017-849-873-314; 029-944-861-818-893; 034-368-810-407-697; 035-964-848-340-165; 037-995-713-689-583; 038-107-047-654-79X; 044-925-330-919-708; 046-850-691-447-936; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-744-930-738-219; 051-965-959-247-371; 054-802-232-146-783; 055-788-708-180-492; 057-286-311-076-534; 060-446-706-486-739; 066-058-608-660-901; 066-507-313-507-599; 073-628-617-778-798; 078-448-638-876-294; 104-065-171-658-156; 105-402-220-957-576; 105-408-446-496-845; 121-011-195-507-937; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 127-458-994-664-604; 137-126-628-585-297; 141-134-741-084-026; 141-725-623-570-482; 149-808-639-989-493; 165-241-012-213-742; 187-169-644-240-76X,3

Evidence from Mendeley,Political science; Altmetrics; Educational impact; Social science; Scientometrics; Audience measurement; Scopus,,2018,journal article,,,1,,,Mike Thelwall,"Female academics are more likely to be in teaching-related roles in some countries, including the USA. As a side effect of this, female-authored journal articles may tend to be more useful for students. This study assesses this hypothesis by investigating whether female first-authored research has more uptake in education than male first-authored research. Based on an analysis of Mendeley readers of articles from 2014 in five countries and 100 narrow Scopus subject categories, the results show that female-authored articles attract more student readers than male-authored articles in Spain, Turkey, the UK and USA but not India. They also attract fewer professorial readers in Spain, the UK and the USA, but not India and Turkey, and tend to be less popular with senior academics. Because the results are based on analysis of differences within narrow fields they cannot be accounted for by females working in more education-related disciplines. The apparent additional educational impact for female-authored research could be due to selecting more accessible micro-specialisms, however, such as health-related instruments within the instrumentation narrow field. Whatever the cause, the results suggest that citation-based research evaluations may undervalue the wider impact of female researchers.",1,,,https://www.journalofaltmetrics.org/articles/10.29024/joa.2/,http://dx.doi.org/10.29024/joa.2,0,,10.29024/joa.2,2895152674,,002-197-115-294-075; 005-011-849-467-618; 011-015-508-319-858; 011-708-409-002-929; 015-570-408-496-249; 016-965-909-496-100; 021-320-997-060-472; 023-271-041-203-090; 026-192-824-742-713; 027-172-473-980-768; 039-445-534-353-562; 040-252-626-797-747; 044-939-394-642-346; 047-754-345-933-794; 051-543-334-765-566; 054-016-914-748-353; 060-446-706-486-739; 066-058-608-660-901; 070-833-443-933-64X; 078-191-527-209-025; 097-994-139-888-028; 100-862-411-425-084; 103-570-139-041-202; 117-211-438-018-858; 121-011-195-507-937; 144-303-055-937-344; 149-330-237-701-944,2

Articles in the 91 journals comprising the “clinical neurology,” “neuroscience,” and “medicine, general, and internal” Web of Science categories were searched for their relevance to the CIDD topic. The Altmetric Explorer database was used to determine the Altmetric.com Attention Score (AAS) values of the selected articles. The papers with the top 100 AAS values were characterized. Results. Articles most frequently mentioned online were primarily published after 2014 and were published in journals with high impact factors. All articles except one were dealt with the issue of multiple sclerosis. Most were original articles, but editorials were also common. Novel treatments and risk factors are the most frequent topics. The AAS was weakly correlated with journal impact factors; however, no link was found between the AAS and the number of citations. Conclusions. We present the top 100 most frequently mentioned CIDD articles in online media using an altmetric approach. Altmetrics can rapidly offer alternative information on the impact of research based on a broader audience and can complement traditional metrics.",2019,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3748091/ http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2019/3748091.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31871939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/3748091,0,31871939,10.1155/2019/3748091,2990694696,,001-788-981-268-621; 002-339-262-577-367; 002-595-770-183-332; 003-263-634-915-338; 007-205-762-763-201; 010-141-385-349-31X; 011-707-999-275-534; 012-075-924-675-633; 012-223-995-579-595; 018-785-563-749-960; 024-016-063-955-355; 029-109-928-591-963; 030-573-021-134-961; 055-788-708-180-492; 066-507-313-507-599; 066-891-997-964-377; 069-386-182-873-855; 070-165-651-115-034; 078-448-638-876-294; 086-426-133-331-160; 086-764-087-181-764; 092-132-106-998-377; 102-973-599-213-44X; 114-774-084-549-589; 118-345-963-149-418; 126-013-474-776-663; 127-458-994-664-604; 133-448-089-635-211,0

One important impact is the downstream effect that research-backed policy can have on the lives of the average citizen. For that reason, we have developed text-mining techniques to discover mentions of research outputs in policy documents created by diverse groups like the International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By automatically identifying references to scholarly content in policy documents, we aim to help researchers and institutions to better understand the “real world” uses of their work. In this poster, we explain our current process for sourcing, scraping, validating, and sharing these important data. We also include case studies that illustrate how policy data mined by Altmetric are being used.

022-564-635-994-531,,14156555,FapUNIFESP (SciELO),Revista de Administração Contemporânea,Desafios da Editoração de Periódicos Científicos no Brasil,Nome; Philosophy; Humanities; SciELO,2015-01-01,2015,journal article,,,1,VI,VIII,Herbert Kimura,"Conforme ja indicado em outros documentos disponibilizados como  Carta ao Leitor , o mercado de editoracao cientifica no Brasil esta passando por diversas mudancas. Se, ate algum tempo atras, as transformacoes eram mais silenciosas, o final de 2014 foi marcado por sinalizacoes mais contundentes, que tem gerado um debate agora um pouco menos timido. Mais particularmente, dois eventos podem ser citados para fundamentar o argumento de importantes alteracoes na dinâmica de periodicos cientificos no Brasil: a proposta da CAPES em bancar a publicacao de revistas nacionais por editoras internacionais, e os novos criterios para admissao e permanencia de periodicos na colecao SciELO. A reuniao da CAPES com editores de periodicos nacionais e com representantes de  publishers  internacionais em outubro de 2014 causou uma discussao intensa na comunidade. Na reuniao, a CAPES informou sobre o planejamento de dois editais. O primeiro edital estaria voltado para a selecao de  publishers  que auxiliariam periodicos nacionais a avancarem na profissionalizacao e na internacionalizacao. O segundo edital selecionaria as revistas nacionais que receberiam suporte financeiro para disponibilizar seus artigos nas plataformas desses  publishers . Assim, um processo de divulgacao com abrangencia internacional poderia gerar maior exposicao e maior impacto global das pesquisas publicadas nas revistas brasileiras. Informacoes sobre esse evento podem ser encontradas na Carta ao Leitor publicada na edicao 18.6 da RAC, em 2014. E importante enfatizar que essa iniciativa da CAPES encontrou tanto apoiadores quanto criticos. Independentemente da perspectiva, a favor ou contra a proposta da CAPES, existe uma movimentacao consistente na busca de melhores indicadores para a producao cientifica nacional. Nesse contexto, o SciELO, em documento de setembro de 2014, estabeleceu novas politicas e procedimentos associados a indexacao nessa plataforma. Dentro do planejamento do SciELO, existem tres acoes consideradas prioritarias para os periodicos cientificos nacionais: profissionalizacao, internacionalizacao e sustentabilidade financeira. Dentre essas acoes, os novos requisitos do SicELO representam, particularmente os relacionados a internacionalizacao, desafios importantes para os quais a maioria dos periodicos das areas de Administracao e Contabilidade, incluindo-se a RAC, ainda tem um caminho a percorrer. Por exemplo, os periodicos terao que obedecer a certos criterios minimos de porcentagem de editores associados, de revisores e de autores com afiliacao estrangeira. Alem disso, ha definicao de uma parcela minima de artigos a serem publicados no idioma ingles pelos periodicos. Para o SciELO, essas iniciativas voltadas a internacionalizacao permitirao maior visibilidade, gerando uma quantidade maior de citacoes de artigos de periodicos da colecao. A despeito de o atendimento a esses requisitos de internacionalizacao nao ser imediato, os periodicos que pretendem ser incluidos ou que desejam se manter na plataforma SciELO devem ja iniciar um planejamento para a adequacao ao novo ambiente. Alem disso, outros pontos de atencao mais prementes foram definidos pelo SciELO e ja estao sendo contemplados ou incorporados pela RAC. Por exemplo, a partir de 2015, o SciELO exige que todos os artigos publicados pelos periodicos da colecao utilizem marcacao XML para automatizar o levantamento de elementos bibliograficos, bem como para viabilizar a disponibilizacao dos artigos em diversos formatos, inclusive para dispositivos moveis. Todos os periodicos deverao tambem ser gerenciados por meio de sistemas de editoracao  online . Destaca-se que a RAC, ja a partir de julho de 2014, tem gerado arquivos em conformidade com o formato do XML-SciELO. Adicionalmente, o periodico migrou do Open Journal System para o ScholarOne Manuscripts, visando a maior agilidade no processo de submissao e no acompanhamento de avaliacoes. E importante estabelecer que a velocidade do fluxo editorial depende nao somente de sistemas automatizados, como tambem de melhoria de eficiencia de processos da equipe editorial, de autores e de avaliadores. Assim, avancos relevantes devem ser empreendidos para que a comunidade entenda que autores e avaliadores possuem responsabilidade para o aprimoramento das metricas dos  journals . Tendo em vista que os diversos desafios impostos pelas alteracoes do mercado de periodicos cientificos exigem capacitacao e profissionalizacao da equipe, os periodicos da ANPAD estiveram presentes em eventos como, por exemplo, os da ABEC e os do SciELO. No XXII Curso de Editoracao Cientifica, em maio de 2014, foram abordados temas diretamente ligados ao processo editorial, como, por exemplo, o idioma de publicacao, a obtencao de revisoes construtivas, o envolvimento de pareceristas, a deteccao de plagio, etc... No VIII Workshop de Editoracao Cientifica promovido pela ABEC, a equipe editorial teve a oportunidade de participar de minicursos, compartilhar experiencias com outras equipes e vislumbrar tendencias no segmento, apresentadas por profissionais brasileiros e estrangeiros. Nesses eventos, ha diversos representantes de periodicos de areas que estao mais avancadas no processo editorial cientifico e, dessa maneira, a troca de informacoes e extremamente enriquecedora. Finalmente, na IV Reuniao Anual do SciELO, foram apresentados diversos indicadores da producao cientifica nacional, bem como as orientacoes que estao sendo definidas para que artigos dos periodicos brasileiros tenham maior impacto na comunidade internacional. Em um contexto em que as mudancas no segmento de periodicos cientificos trazem tambem questoes referentes a sustentabilidade financeira, a RAC tem a satisfacao de informar a obtencao de recursos em chamada de 2014 do MCTI/CNPq/MEC/CAPES para apoio a editoracao de periodicos. Parte dos valores desse apoio financeiro sera utilizada para aperfeicoamento da revista, principalmente em relacao a aspectos de formatacao e disponibilizacao de conteudo, com o objetivo de conferir maiores visibilidade, influencia e impacto. Em particular, tendo sido contemplada tambem com recursos na chamada de editoracao de 2013, a RAC iniciou o projeto de marcacao XML nao somente para atender as novas exigencias do SciELO, como tambem para estabelecer as bases de um sistema que permita a geracao de algumas metricas de impacto de artigos, autores, periodicos, instituicoes. Nesse sentido, antecipando obstaculos para integracao e compilacao de dados, alguns itens, embora possam parecer meros detalhes, sao relevantes, dentro de uma perspectiva de internacionalizacao da producao nacional. Por exemplo, a existencia do  Digital Object Identifier  (DOI) de cada trabalho e fundamental para a captura automatica de dados bibliograficos. Destaca-se que todos os periodicos da colecao SciELO possuem DOI. Alem disso, outro detalhe importante e a necessidade de o autor estabelecer um padrao para referencias a seus trabalhos.  Benson e Silver (2013)  alertam para o fato de que nomes de autores representam fonte de confusao comum, fazendo com que editores tenham grande dificuldade em reproduzir e indexar adequadamente essas informacoes, principalmente quando nao seguem convencoes usuais. Se, quando o artigo e direcionado ao publico brasileiro, a preocupacao com o nome pode nao ser grande, ao buscar leitores em outros lugares do mundo, a notacao pode fazer diferenca. Abordagens distintas em relacao a ordem entre nome e sobrenome, a acentuacao dos nomes proprios ou a inclusao de sufixos como  Filho  e  Neto , podem implicar diferentes metricas de produtividade de um determinado autor. No caso de autores brasileiros,  Benson e Silver (2013)  citam explicitamente que a existencia de multiplos sobrenomes pode levar a problemas ou inconsistencias nas bases de autores. Nesses casos, metricas do autor podem ficar comprometidas como, por exemplo, o indice h. O indice h, sugerido por  Hirsch (2005) , e uma medida que reflete a producao e o impacto de um autor, levando em consideracao as citacoes de seus artigos. De acordo com  Hirsch (2005) , um pesquisador possui um indice h se, dentre seus N artigos, um numero h deles recebe um minimo de h citacoes, sendo que os outros N-h artigos nao possuem, individualmente, mais de h citacoes. Assim, a identificacao consistente do nome do autor torna-se necessaria. Assim, o acompanhamento de metricas depende nao somente da adequada marcacao XML, como tambem da padronizacao, por parte do autor, de suas informacoes. Esse procedimento de uniformizacao de dados permitira, tambem, que trabalhos do autor sejam melhor rastreados em medidas alternativas como as  Altmetrics , ou seja, indicadores baseados em  web  e calculados a partir de plataformas de midia social como, por exemplo, Twitter e Mendeley ( Bornman, 2014 ). Como o leitor pode perceber, as mudancas no mercado de editoria cientifica trazem tambem desafios aos proprios autores e pesquisadores. Esperamos a todos que o ano de 2015 seja proficuo e produtivo.",19,,,https://rac.anpad.org.br/index.php/rac/article/view/1086/1082,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1982-7849rac2015140135,0,,10.1590/1982-7849rac2015140135,2953061057,,101-752-490-869-458; 130-446-333-613-121,0

Methods To identify all 2015 dental articles, PubMed was searched via Altmetric platform using the following query: (“2015/1/1”[PDAT]: “2015/12/31”[PDAT]) AND jsubsetd[text] NOT 2016[PDAT] on November 12, 2016. Altmetric data of all 2015 dental articles and journals were extracted and analysed by Microsoft Office Excel 2016 using descriptive statistics, graphs and trend-line analysis. To find the most important and influential Altmetric factors, multi-layered perceptron artificial neural network was employed using SPSS 22. Results A total of 14,884 dental articles published in 2015 using PubMed database were found, from which 5,153 (34.62%) articles had an Altmetric score. The mean Altmetric score was 2.94 ± 9.2 (95% C.I:2.703.22). Mendeley readers (73.19%), Twitter (21.48%), Facebook walls (3.67%), news outlets (0.69%) and bloggers (0.57%) were the most popular Altmetric data resources. At journal level, 147 dental journals with valid Altmetric data were included in the study. The British Dental Journal had the first rank, followed by Journal of Dental Research, Journal of Clinical Periodontology and Journal of the American Dental Association. Sensitivity analysis showed news outlets, tweeters and scientific bloggers were the most important and influential Altmetric data resources. Discussion In comparison with all science subjects and medical and health sciences, 2015 Altmetric scores in dentistry were very low. Uses of new and emerging scholarly tools such as social media, scientific blogs and post-publication peer-review were not common in the dental science. This negligence may be due to lack of knowledge and attitude. An Altmetric score is dynamic and may fluctuate over time.",222,"Bibliometrics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dentistry/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Neural Networks, Computer; Periodicals as Topic/statistics & numerical data",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28496225 https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2017.408 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28496225,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.408,0,28496225,10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.408,2612737072,,005-619-169-003-962; 011-744-070-943-487; 013-848-964-561-065; 014-757-557-781-557; 019-759-009-179-03X; 033-852-335-746-849; 036-612-601-064-24X; 043-606-791-244-024; 043-926-859-214-140; 047-436-441-352-101; 059-533-152-812-52X; 066-507-313-507-599; 075-820-818-611-110; 102-425-329-167-44X; 136-242-137-490-99X; 186-429-639-951-411,13

This method is modeled after the traditional cost-per-use method of analyzing a library collection, and facilitates comparison to other non-OA items. The first example consisted of using a formula dividing the total library-funded article processing charges (APCs) by the total global use of the specific PLOS journal articles that were funded. The second and third examples demonstrated what a library-funded OA membership to BioMed Central would cost alone, and then with APCs that cost could be divided by the total usage of the funded articles to determine cost-per-use.; Main Results – The authors found both of the examples described in the article to be potential ways of determining cost-per-use of OA articles, with some limitations. For instance, counting article usage through the publisher’s website may not capture the true usage of an article, as it does not take altmetrics into consideration. In addition, article-level data is not always readily available. In addition, the cost-per-use of OA articles was found to be very low, ranging from $0.01 to $1.51 after the first three years of publication based on the cost of library-funded APCs. The second and third methods revealed a cost-per-use of $0.10 using membership-only payments, while using the cost of membership plus APCs resulted in a cost-per-use of $0.41.; Conclusion – Libraries may wish to consider using these methods for demonstrating the value of OA funds in terms of return on investment, as these techniques allow for direct comparison to the usage of traditional journals. However, several barriers need to be overcome in how article-level usage is obtained in order for these methods to be more accurate and efficient. In addition, while the authors report that ""The specific examples in this study suggest that OA APCs may compare favorably to traditional publishing when considering value for money based on cost per use,"" they also caution that the study was not designed to answer the question if the ROI is greater for OA publications than for traditional articles, stating that ""...the data in this study should not be interpreted as a verification of such an argument, as this study was not designed to answer that question, nor can it do so given the limitations on the data. This paper was designed to present and illustrate a method. Further study would be necessary to verify or refute this possibility"" (p. 15).",13,,,https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/eblip/index.php/EBLIP/article/view/29453,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/eblip29453,0,,10.18438/eblip29453,2903840067,,,0

While Wikipedia offers high-quality content about certain topics, a large proportion of articles are insufficiently developed. The Wikimedia Foundation has engaged in partnerships with scientific and academic institutions to improve the coverage and communication of science to the public. These efforts are beneficial to professional and academic associations interested in sharing reliable, vetted information about their discipline with the world. Methods The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is one of the research agencies engaged in this effort. NIOSH developed and manages the WikiProject Occupational Safety and Health. NIOSH also participates in a classroom program (where students write Wikipedia articles) to expand and improve Wikipedia’s content on public and occupational health. The evaluation of their efforts is conducted using an Altmetrics platform that tracks alternative metrics for information products located on the web that have a persistent tracking number, such as an ISBN or DOI. Result Metrics on these efforts are publicly available thru Wikipedia, the Wiki Education Foundation and Altmetric so reach can be evaluated continuously by the number of views and quality of entries.

To highlight and share small pieces of information with possibly vast audiences or small circles of the interested has some value in almost any aspect of social life. But what is the value exactly for a scientific field? We perform a comprehensive study of computer scientists using Twitter and their tweeting behavior concerning the sharing of web links. Discerning the domains, hosts and individual web pages being tweeted and the differences between computer scientists and a Twitter sample enables us to look in depth at the Twitter-based information sharing practices of a scientific community. Additionally, we aim at providing a deeper understanding of the role and impact of altmetrics in computer science and give a glance at the publications mentioned on Twitter that are most relevant for the computer science community. Our results show a link sharing culture that concentrates more heavily on public and professional quality information than the Twitter sample does. The results also show a broad variety in linked sources and especially in linked publications with some publications clearly related to community-specific interests of computer scientists, while others with a strong relation to attention mechanisms in social media. This refers to the observation that Twitter is a hybrid form of social media between an information service and a social network service. Overall the computer scientists’ style of usage seems to be more on the information-oriented side and to some degree also on professional usage.

The question of whether the literature on Leonardo da Vinci reflects his interdisciplinarity as scientist and artist is addressed. We argue that the medical and material sciences show a high number of citations to the respective publications, and much higher number of citations to publications ratio than the humanities and social sciences fields. We also found that there is no relationship between the number of publications for each research area and the citations (between productivity and quality). The largest category of papers, in terms of citations and in terms of the number of subfields, discussing da Vinci’s contribution to the various sciences, belongs to exact sciences. This finding is surprising as Leonardo da Vinci has become a synonym for the mysterious artist whose paintings consist of many messages that are difficult to explain. Therefore it seems natural that Leonardo the artist would get a lot of research attention. Nevertheless, the bibliometric findings show that the academic community has interest in his contributions to science, no less than in his work of art.",55,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12115-018-0307-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12115-018-0307-1,0,,10.1007/s12115-018-0307-1,2898788542,,008-337-027-012-736; 016-325-303-690-114; 030-731-390-088-21X; 098-922-849-763-020; 100-462-090-393-92X; 125-557-446-223-390; 166-083-420-398-251,1

Alternative metrics (‘altmetrics’), first described by Priem and colleagues,1 is a term used to describe ‘web-based metrics for the impact of scholarly material with an emphasis on social media outlets as a source of data’.2 These article-level metrics are increasingly being used in conjunction with traditional bibliometric methods, such as the Impact Factor (IF), the immediacy index, and citation counts, to assess the impact of journals and journal articles and the outputs of individual researchers.; ; A journal’s IF is calculated as the average number of times articles published in the past 2 years have been cited in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR).3 The IF is not article specific, does not show the immediacy of the citation count, and may not be an appropriate or accurate means of assessing the overall impact of research in an article. The h-index4 is another measure that is frequently used to define an individual researcher’s citation records. There is a growing consensus that the IF as a single measure of quality is outdated. The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA)5 recommends the need to eliminate the use of journal-based metrics. It suggests that publishers should offer a range of performance measures to assess and evaluate scholarly output. Altmetrics have the potential to add another dimension to this.; ; Traditional bibliometric analysis and peer review have formed the standard methods to assess the ‘scientific status of disciplines, research institutes and scientists’,6 and it is well known that unless the ‘discipline’ or research is published in a journal with a high IF then it may be ‘lost’.

With a number of highly visible studies both in the natural sciences and in political science using such data to shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying violent conflict, researchers have recently raised issues of systematic (reporting) biases. While many sources of bias are qualitatively known, biases in event data are usually not studied with quantitative methods. In this study we focus on a unique case - the conflict in Iraq - that is covered by two independently collected datasets: Iraq Body Count (IBC) reports of civilian casualties and Significant Action (SIGACT) military data. We systematically identify a number of key quantitative differences between the event reporting in the two datasets and demonstrate that even for subsets where both datasets are most consistent at an aggregate level, the daily time series and timing signatures of events differ significantly. This suggests that at any level of analysis the choice of dataset may substantially affect any inferences drawn, with attendant consequences for a number of recent studies of the conflict in Iraq. We further outline how the insights gained from our analysis of conflict event data have broader implications for studies using similar data on other social processes.",3,,,https://epjds.epj.org/articles/epjdata/abs/2014/01/13688_2014_Article_25/13688_2014_Article_25.html http://www.epjdatascience.com/content/3/1/25 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140%2Fepjds%2Fs13688-014-0025-x.pdf https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0025-x https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/36231 https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0025-x https://core.ac.uk/display/81715495 https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0025-x https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0025-x https://paperity.org/p/50628724/views-to-a-war-systematic-differences-in-media-and-military-reporting-of-the-war-in-iraq https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81715495.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0025-x,0,,10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0025-x,2102423903,,001-310-713-901-731; 005-105-361-176-494; 006-142-850-989-559; 008-325-353-547-164; 015-479-975-062-052; 016-660-542-587-112; 019-515-487-523-543; 020-330-388-163-583; 020-343-625-653-803; 021-027-432-105-458; 021-720-113-838-49X; 022-743-109-964-221; 023-081-414-162-475; 023-214-347-396-576; 024-195-179-339-147; 029-781-914-688-700; 030-910-448-945-75X; 031-135-060-533-849; 031-626-201-644-777; 034-099-448-571-001; 036-493-306-521-859; 038-400-317-404-559; 047-504-385-064-392; 047-959-703-338-282; 054-492-546-823-555; 057-586-071-243-253; 057-811-021-409-030; 058-643-909-275-756; 059-715-779-271-71X; 063-095-172-656-162; 063-196-365-665-631; 063-680-896-170-974; 064-155-236-845-703; 064-983-128-387-606; 066-226-743-764-594; 066-507-313-507-599; 070-961-289-647-86X; 071-598-315-562-695; 076-037-351-531-687; 079-588-325-267-667; 086-970-021-716-612; 089-021-112-040-499; 089-545-380-042-80X; 093-372-255-961-075; 094-096-808-082-985; 094-467-235-915-416; 096-976-738-232-21X; 099-114-030-653-65X; 101-460-831-219-265; 105-395-385-823-338; 105-592-035-766-428; 110-010-586-420-202; 129-915-946-532-002; 131-481-856-740-824; 133-818-082-699-947; 146-446-694-631-625; 151-795-142-475-018; 154-051-538-321-848; 156-413-086-375-068; 156-591-274-781-137; 169-714-476-713-369; 175-269-025-009-211; 192-121-474-881-481,3

The production and publication of that data should be recognized as valuable scholarship, but data lacks an essential prerequisite for modern-day scholarly recognition—accepted metrics of significance. The scientific community has traditionally estimated the impact of a journal article by counting the number of subsequent references to it; more recently, a suite of web-based alternative metrics (‘altmetrics’) offer faster assessment and the chance capture other kinds of impact1. Data can be fit into these article-centered assessment systems by proxy, via data descriptor articles in journals like Earth Systems Science Data or Scientific Data2,3. Another approach is to apply familiar metrics directly to datasets published in online databases or repositories. Complicating matters, the same metric may mean different things with respect to articles versus datasets. A researcher can read an article online closely without downloading the PDF version, but if they view a dataset landing page without downloading the data, their level of engagement is almost certainly low.

Massaro,"Background A prior randomized controlled trial of social media exposure at Circulation determined that social media did not increase 30‐day page views. Whether insufficient social media intensity contributed to these results is uncertain.; ; Methods and Results Original article manuscripts were randomized to social media exposure compared with no social media exposure (control) at Circulation beginning in January 2015. Social media exposure consisted of Facebook and Twitter posts on the journal's accounts. To increase social media intensity, a larger base of followers was built using advertising and organic growth, and posts were presented in triplicate and boosted on Facebook and retweeted on Twitter. The primary outcome was 30‐day page views. Stopping rules were established at the point that 50% of the manuscripts were randomized and had 30‐day follow‐up to compare groups on 30‐day page views. The trial was stopped for futility on September 26, 2015. Overall, 74 manuscripts were randomized to receive social media exposure, and 78 manuscripts were randomized to the control arm. The intervention and control arms were similar based on article type ( P =0.85), geographic location of the corresponding author ( P =0.33), and whether the manuscript had an editorial ( P =0.80). Median number of 30‐day page views was 499.5 in the social media arm and 450.5 in the control arm; there was no evidence of a treatment effect ( P =0.38). There were no statistically significant interactions of treatment by manuscript type ( P =0.86), by corresponding author ( P =0.35), by trimester of publication date ( P =0.34), or by editorial status ( P =0.79).; ; Conclusions A more intensive social media strategy did not result in increased 30‐day page views of original research.",5,Humans; Internet; Marketing; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Social Media,,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/jaha.115.003088 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27121850 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27121850 https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/27662137 http://jaha.ahajournals.org/content/5/5/e003088 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4889182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/jaha.115.003088,0,27121850,10.1161/jaha.115.003088,2342510006,PMC4889182,008-252-780-662-680; 010-537-281-905-239; 011-775-157-588-299; 017-573-461-799-106; 018-861-411-710-786; 025-015-884-448-862; 044-826-036-399-71X; 050-252-270-491-60X; 056-278-133-462-97X; 057-531-335-698-852; 066-420-899-984-779; 066-507-313-507-599; 071-123-245-005-332; 111-466-843-772-308,23

Button; Marcus R. Munafò,"Most researchers acknowledge an intrinsic hierarchy in the scholarly journals (“journal rank”) that they submit their work to, and adjust not only their submission but also their reading strategies accordingly. On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.",7,,,http://epub.uni-regensburg.de/28746/1/fnhum%2D07%2D00291.pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/abstract https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/deep-impact-unintended-consequences-of-journal-rank http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3690355/ http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1301.html#abs-1301-3748 https://core.ac.uk/display/16688661 https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/deep-impact(c4dc3781-7542-4fad-b32e-8ea3e0cfbdb2)/export.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690355/ https://pubpeer.com/publications/01B460630DA0B1424A4E568D23472D https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=cf9feaf7-077f-432f-b9aa-e9861d421d6f https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/28746/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/pdf http://live.offene-doktorarbeit.de/quelle/Brembs_2013 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82840099.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291,0,23805088,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291,2103948822,PMC3690355,000-038-775-431-310; 002-320-710-546-768; 003-557-959-301-864; 005-570-162-494-063; 005-760-982-046-853; 006-457-039-206-005; 006-457-411-091-209; 006-539-152-046-073; 007-043-383-870-200; 007-081-125-036-296; 008-812-618-060-828; 009-806-913-742-800; 010-922-406-661-540; 011-048-122-221-365; 011-337-603-968-030; 011-754-235-054-311; 012-992-198-692-890; 015-198-151-868-861; 015-567-817-927-719; 015-883-899-751-431; 016-136-171-348-364; 017-085-829-673-85X; 017-688-558-362-189; 017-900-658-482-220; 018-046-596-789-492; 018-141-003-523-134; 018-558-981-410-660; 018-678-941-310-020; 018-679-713-681-844; 020-574-736-729-573; 020-737-737-369-93X; 020-885-179-109-002; 020-887-546-787-796; 021-843-823-560-621; 022-570-676-804-758; 022-777-683-846-284; 022-922-842-060-501; 023-973-026-957-261; 024-213-603-549-511; 024-823-049-331-504; 026-164-149-438-516; 028-800-911-277-740; 029-175-246-581-544; 029-275-447-659-262; 029-275-968-917-116; 029-366-078-413-649; 029-511-659-481-648; 030-265-852-580-503; 030-425-337-421-604; 031-250-793-155-21X; 031-301-689-003-731; 032-094-932-105-517; 032-878-937-320-799; 034-371-395-876-396; 034-499-800-499-452; 034-749-433-776-444; 035-444-147-427-058; 037-871-369-132-06X; 038-260-853-743-00X; 038-370-977-339-09X; 039-171-995-099-848; 039-505-270-645-642; 040-764-006-633-177; 041-433-034-697-135; 041-686-938-764-332; 041-970-712-811-974; 043-298-294-118-973; 043-340-530-955-703; 043-617-609-965-006; 043-869-835-870-671; 046-655-441-574-330; 049-153-876-603-187; 049-898-881-273-510; 050-002-114-288-085; 050-719-220-759-782; 051-068-977-391-158; 051-413-995-162-257; 052-090-012-058-700; 052-721-183-516-807; 055-621-361-329-205; 056-763-990-330-735; 058-879-760-182-519; 060-905-981-244-929; 064-291-140-248-118; 064-474-336-766-066; 065-832-661-563-75X; 066-617-920-436-857; 066-839-689-325-444; 067-873-273-171-010; 068-128-557-934-813; 068-853-513-344-450; 069-730-469-626-704; 073-769-934-332-65X; 075-139-433-566-577; 079-911-440-353-859; 080-731-787-057-212; 081-870-279-713-304; 084-006-498-514-011; 084-385-827-724-38X; 084-394-726-222-377; 087-391-896-592-122; 089-571-980-818-260; 089-660-550-933-845; 091-035-154-896-614; 091-541-211-455-180; 093-951-158-344-872; 096-158-847-688-094; 100-080-855-264-000; 100-336-535-803-673; 102-565-141-814-873; 110-194-771-195-480; 112-640-353-590-20X; 113-494-757-364-958; 115-036-770-697-145; 116-394-282-065-030; 116-963-376-953-669; 117-704-576-690-269; 119-543-644-010-682; 121-092-652-122-846; 121-118-846-398-122; 125-005-885-072-656; 125-644-333-558-843; 126-252-055-617-009; 126-963-830-826-874; 129-988-999-440-854; 130-623-328-861-459; 138-065-934-828-189; 141-134-741-084-026; 148-996-224-496-800; 151-646-811-679-140; 151-678-690-622-274; 161-704-622-816-21X; 164-725-320-728-240; 166-220-757-208-933; 167-387-958-245-627; 167-690-084-541-653; 178-348-684-531-382; 178-940-076-847-378,166

Fueled by technological possibilities and an increasing demand to demonstrate impact beyond the scientific community, altmetrics have received great attention as potential democratizers of the scientific reward system and indicators of societal impact. This paper focuses on the current challenges for altmetrics. Heterogeneity, data quality and particular dependencies are identified as the three major issues and discussed in detail with an emphasis on past developments in bibliometrics. The heterogeneity of altmetrics reflects the diversity of the acts and online events, most of which take place on social media platforms. This heterogeneity has made it difficult to establish a common definition or conceptual framework. Data quality issues become apparent in the lack of accuracy, consistency and replicability of various altmetrics, which is largely affected by the dynamic nature of social media events. Furthermore altmetrics are shaped by technical possibilities and are particularly dependent on the availability of APIs and DOIs, strongly dependent on data providers and aggregators, and potentially influenced by the technical affordances of underlying platforms.",108,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1603.html#Haustein16 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2962819 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160304939H/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04939 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-016-1910-9 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1910-9 https://crc.ebsi.umontreal.ca/en/publications/grand-challenges-in-altmetrics-heterogeneity-data-quality-and-dependencies/ http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1910-9 https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1910-9,0,,10.1007/s11192-016-1910-9,2298224214,,001-731-506-576-898; 002-666-995-736-984; 003-019-225-525-983; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-150-591-136-318; 009-222-447-794-574; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-141-385-349-31X; 011-897-978-960-946; 018-303-419-151-652; 019-120-240-188-628; 019-457-587-825-722; 023-271-041-203-090; 024-491-347-287-793; 029-165-255-951-763; 029-500-644-026-171; 034-605-737-341-631; 038-212-076-923-252; 040-252-626-797-747; 047-436-441-352-101; 051-965-959-247-371; 053-086-790-955-429; 053-827-960-061-58X; 054-178-855-505-010; 055-788-708-180-492; 063-144-189-164-648; 065-951-100-643-938; 068-624-912-307-025; 068-703-226-662-380; 079-343-312-870-007; 099-816-321-816-355; 104-285-529-755-546; 107-711-465-423-080; 118-533-064-636-376; 127-458-994-664-604; 132-816-312-839-541; 141-134-741-084-026; 141-212-834-542-277; 141-338-037-979-664; 154-271-389-625-278; 160-462-293-223-417,86

We propose that relational analyses of social media platforms may shed new light on these understudied dimensions of scientific impact and may enrich assessment efforts.

One major hurdle within the scientific community has been the lack of widely accepted standards for citing that data, making it difficult to track usage and measure impact. Within the neuroimaging community, there is a need for a way to not only clearly identify and cite datasets, but also to derive new aggregate sets from multiple sources, while clearly maintaining lines of attribution. This work presents a functional prototype of a system to integrate Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and a standardized metadata schema into a XNAT-based repository workflow, allowing for identification of data at both the project and image level. These item and source level identifiers allow any newly defined combination of images, from any number of projects, to be tagged with a new group-level DOI that automatically inherits the individual attributes and provenance information of its constituent parts. This system enables the tracking of data reuse, down to the level of individual images. The implementation of this type of data identification system would impact researchers and data creators, data hosting facilities, and data publishers, but the benefit of having widely accepted standards for data identification and attribution would go far towards making data citation practical and advantageous.",10,,,https://works.bepress.com/jean_frazier/128/ https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/psych_pp/737/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27570508 http://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1741&context=psych_pp http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034/full https://core.ac.uk/display/82880012 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82880012.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2016.00034,0,27570508,10.3389/fninf.2016.00034,2515962581,PMC4981598,003-165-123-577-307; 003-203-981-612-441; 007-939-775-319-655; 009-531-378-283-656; 013-549-812-638-473; 014-171-565-767-028; 016-237-096-150-851; 022-526-129-975-007; 026-770-856-777-074; 030-425-337-421-604; 035-164-163-473-242; 038-732-681-796-772; 040-258-093-157-997; 043-322-951-277-390; 044-824-009-095-121; 049-898-881-273-510; 056-203-010-869-669; 068-252-359-061-757; 070-462-022-251-464; 070-879-517-241-966; 078-145-866-744-80X; 081-306-131-270-108; 096-227-622-831-693; 123-515-738-896-329; 147-285-090-437-276,9

The survey was implemented via Google Forms and sent through mailing lists. The number of recipients was not known, but university statistics for 11 of the 12 universities list 17,380 faculty (statistics were not available for one university, located in a different administrative area). The questions aimed to identify the types of documents used by scholars for teaching and research, the search tools used, the strategies used to keep up-to-date in their disciplines, preferences for print or electronic books, the sources used to access documents, their preferred channels to disseminate their own research, and their views regarding library services.; ; Main Results – The response rate was 12.7%. Based on the results, scholarly journals were the most used information resource for research across all academic disciplines, with 94% of respondents rating them as important. For teaching, faculty preferred to use textbooks for undergraduates, and journal articles for Master’s students. To search the literature, faculty chose bibliographic databases and Internet search engines over the library catalog and physical collections, although the catalog was the first choice for known-item searches. Respondents favored print to read entire books or chapters but preferred the electronic format for skimming. Of the respondents, 78% rated the library as an important channel to access resources, while 61% also considered free online materials important. If the material was not available at their library, 71% frequently chose to search for a free online version and 42% used the inter-library loan service. For their own research, faculty have published in scholarly journals more often than other channels and have selected the journal based on its impact factor (77.5% ranked it as important) and on its area of coverage (73.4%). When asked to rank library services, faculty placed paying for resources highest, with 86.2% identifying it as important. Next were facilitating teaching and helping students develop information literacy skills. Finally, a majority of faculty considered themselves highly dependent on the library.; ; Conclusion – Journal articles are the most widely used information resource for research and teaching purposes, regardless of discipline. This includes arts and humanities, which are known for heavy monograph usage. Articles are also scholars’ preferred channel for publishing. With regards to books, faculty have mixed feelings about print and electronic formats. Spanish faculty display information behaviours similar to their British and American counterparts, as documented in the Ithaka S+R 2012 surveys. Blogs and social networks are not widely used in spite of growing attention to such channels for research output and altmetrics. Open access is also relatively unimportant for faculty when they choose where to publish. A majority of respondents still consider library services as important, for collections as well as teaching and learning support, which may present opportunities for librarians.",11,,,https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/EBLIP/article/view/27835/0 https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/eblip/index.php/EBLIP/article/view/27835/0,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/b8hs6m,0,,10.18438/b8hs6m,2524262208,,,1

Recent government reviews, such as the Research Excellence Framework in the UK, have placed increasing demands on authors to provide substantial evidence of the academic and wider impact of their work. Over reliance on indices such as the Impact Factor has led to questionable tactics – with researchers seemingly choosing to submit work produced in the format that is most likely to have accrued impact demonstrated in the form of citations (i.e. published articles). But what about other outputs, and the other attention the work has received, and its application in real-world practices? Altmetrics, or alternative metrics, have evolved in the last few years as an alternative to only using the Impact Factor, and offer a much richer picture of how a piece of research has been received. Instead of only looking at how the work is received within academia (most often via a citation count) altmetrics track the sharing and discussion of research in a much wider range of online sources – including global traditional and social media, post-publication peer-review forums, and public policy documents. A focus on the qualitative data rather than the quantitative enables a better understanding of where and why the work is being discussed and potentially put into practice. It also offers a chance to focus on an individual article instead of making an assumption based on the perceived quality of the journal it is published in – a key pain point for those involved in research evaluation. A relatively new field, there is still much work to be done into what, why, and how the attention surrounding a paper should (or should not) be measured. There is already a justified concern that they will simply become another number by which a researcher can be judged, and a danger that they will be used to indicate quality where in reality they can offer nothing of the sort. What they do provide, however, is a valuable insight into the wider reception of research, and in a much more immediate way than citation counts alone are able to give. New tools are being developed at a rapid pace to enable institutions and funders to more easily track where the research their authors publish is being picked up – to help identify success stories and to further validate their knowledge of their audiences. We will give a brief overview of the progress within the field of altmetrics to date, including tangible use cases amongst academics and institutional managers, and explore how by pulling together academic impact (the more traditional bibliometrics) and the wider societal impact (altmetrics) it is possible to benefit from delving deeper into the context and engagement surrounding research.",,,,http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/SCS/article/view/3230 https://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/SCS/article/view/3230,http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/5.3230,0,,10.7557/5.3230,2038532656,,,1

In the last few years, the interest in altmetrics has grown, giving rise to many questions regarding their potential benefits and challenges. This paper aims to address some of these questions. First, we provide an overview of the altmetrics landscape, comparing tool features, social media data sources, and social media events provided by altmetric aggregators. Second, we conduct a systematic review of the altmetrics literature. A total of 172 articles were analysed, revealing a steady rise in altmetrics research since 2011. Third, we analyse the results of over 80 studies from the altmetrics literature on two major research topics: cross-metric validation and coverage of altmetrics. An aggregated percentage coverage across studies on 11 data sources shows that Mendeley has the highest coverage of about 59 % across 15 studies. A meta-analysis across more than 40 cross-metric validation studies shows overall a weak correlation (ranging from 0.08 to 0.5) between altmetrics and citation counts, confirming that altmetrics do indeed measure a different kind of research impact, thus acting as a complement rather than a substitute to traditional metrics. Finally, we highlight open challenges and issues facing altmetrics and discuss future research areas.",109,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v109y2016i2d10.1007_s11192-016-2077-0.html https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2077-0 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3011692 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-016-2077-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2077-0,0,,10.1007/s11192-016-2077-0,2488987723,,001-731-506-576-898; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-011-849-467-618; 005-278-577-590-526; 006-351-772-268-027; 007-900-260-270-647; 008-150-591-136-318; 009-222-447-794-574; 009-989-170-038-218; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-474-157-259-115; 010-537-281-905-239; 011-897-978-960-946; 015-270-923-005-163; 015-367-685-215-43X; 015-790-477-028-099; 016-644-936-482-33X; 019-120-240-188-628; 019-161-426-176-781; 019-549-905-486-905; 021-017-849-873-314; 021-120-673-715-990; 021-696-172-742-263; 022-970-333-981-149; 023-271-041-203-090; 024-791-978-806-195; 026-690-594-587-368; 027-205-205-984-47X; 029-322-655-785-959; 030-307-964-782-276; 034-605-737-341-631; 035-123-753-214-354; 035-205-069-238-404; 038-264-066-505-537; 040-081-269-911-009; 040-452-112-976-920; 041-769-786-296-632; 046-850-691-447-936; 047-232-143-954-249; 047-754-345-933-794; 048-656-607-559-008; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-277-248-391-128; 050-394-782-421-617; 051-472-143-393-282; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-129-828-982-897; 053-086-790-955-429; 055-197-819-525-25X; 055-808-236-401-052; 055-831-901-562-709; 056-764-246-223-493; 057-286-311-076-534; 058-593-263-741-427; 058-798-634-261-481; 059-222-532-022-222; 060-383-547-303-222; 063-144-189-164-648; 066-058-608-660-901; 066-507-313-507-599; 066-827-534-057-723; 067-897-343-637-16X; 068-224-488-858-924; 071-814-237-362-770; 072-463-767-991-704; 072-719-106-592-112; 073-628-617-778-798; 075-267-966-095-209; 076-399-144-464-512; 077-595-428-639-93X; 078-391-322-041-210; 078-581-598-392-668; 089-354-400-351-318; 093-422-010-000-906; 097-088-943-118-521; 098-735-085-587-405; 099-676-204-626-155; 099-816-321-816-355; 100-133-246-409-16X; 102-224-708-510-868; 104-777-393-167-585; 105-408-446-496-845; 107-711-465-423-080; 108-961-779-726-939; 110-457-195-877-695; 111-241-030-578-72X; 114-569-399-530-919; 115-493-561-227-28X; 121-011-195-507-937; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 126-062-861-008-278; 127-458-994-664-604; 128-511-665-080-540; 129-098-062-346-311; 130-446-333-613-121; 131-548-455-537-095; 132-388-166-608-244; 132-626-974-159-177; 134-942-428-873-91X; 137-491-293-350-124; 138-384-327-460-544; 138-411-397-282-780; 139-503-689-611-173; 139-651-430-124-012; 141-134-741-084-026; 141-212-834-542-277; 149-808-639-989-493; 150-106-942-587-883; 160-462-293-223-417; 163-502-281-381-20X; 163-595-480-871-354; 174-532-146-943-325; 174-743-361-740-440; 195-502-372-809-145,58

Authorship, academic affiliation, date published, articletype, and format were tabulated for descriptive analysis. Using metrics from Google Scholar, alternativescholarly impact metrics (altmetrics), and the eScholarship website, the authors identified top articles andgrouped them into themes.Results: Of the 136 articles included in the first four years of the Special Issue, 126 represented peerreviewedpublications with an overall acceptance rate of 25.0% (126/505). Authors from this cohortrepresented 103 of the 182 (56.6%) Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)programs in existence at the time of the inaugural issue. Multi-institutional studies represented 34.9%(44/126) of the peer-reviewed publications. Traditional and alternative publication metrics are reported toassess the impact of articles from the Special Issues.Conclusion: The Special Issue is a proven outlet to share best practices, innovations, and researchrelated to education.

In this citation analysis, abstracts were examined. Results Drawing on a dataset containing articles aggregated via Altmetric Explorer, a querying interface provided by Altmetric LLP, content analysis was used to 1) determine the distribution of federal statistics incorporated in scholarly studies, and 2) qualitatively understand the particular ways in which studies incorporated federal statistics. It was found that the dominant source of federal statistics was the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), followed by the Census Bureau, and then the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prevalent qualitative themes underlying the studies in this dataset included mortality and population studies, linked datasets, international studies, and critical studies (i.e. presenting alternative measures for federal statistics). Conclusions When querying studies referencing one or more of the principal US statistical agencies in Altmetric Explorer, almost all studies in the final dataset cited these agencies because they had cited federal statistics. This finding need not have been the case however. A separate study on the use of federal statistics in scholarly research will compare altmetrics to traditional citation analysis. Preliminary results from Google Scholar, using traditional citations, found non-dataset publications to be the most frequently cited titles from NCHS and the Census Bureau.",32,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X1500060X https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2015.05.002 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X1500060X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2015.05.002,0,,10.1016/j.giq.2015.05.002,570513229,,001-816-866-938-824; 003-035-019-639-728; 004-126-036-978-457; 010-540-142-901-85X; 012-265-155-436-116; 017-956-158-383-843; 018-942-909-655-483; 028-994-605-031-222; 035-964-848-340-165; 036-610-716-379-365; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-899-064-056-76X; 054-130-618-046-268; 060-545-809-238-66X; 063-386-249-155-252; 064-199-122-091-530; 066-507-313-507-599; 077-703-618-427-060; 088-648-967-653-090; 104-296-149-127-787; 112-163-124-398-602; 122-488-184-647-509; 123-940-043-975-116; 127-076-514-010-940; 141-134-741-084-026; 148-390-032-154-447; 159-420-120-513-255; 167-384-816-280-183; 172-253-610-299-656,2

Bowman; Fereshteh Didegah; Jonne Lehtimäki,"The goals of this research were two-fold. First, this research set out to investigate possible institutional characteristics that may or may not have an influence on online attention or, in other words, the number of altmetric events surrounding the scientific articles from that institution. The results suggest that international connections are important in the accumulation of altmetric events, possibly due to the creation of weak ties between researchers and their institutions. Second, it was studied whether the institutional research profile, i.e. in what fields the institution published, matched with the distribution of altmetric events across the same fields of science. Our analysis shows that the universities’ research profiles are not always reflected in the online events. Overall, the results of both goals of this research reflect a complex system where the received online attention can be attributed to many different factors.",2,,,https://www.journalofaltmetrics.org/articles/10.29024/joa.20/,http://dx.doi.org/10.29024/joa.20,0,,10.29024/joa.20,2970982669,,000-114-141-599-148; 001-731-506-576-898; 005-969-100-665-44X; 010-393-512-386-940; 017-104-460-279-190; 021-120-673-715-990; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-537-583-432-28X; 028-800-911-277-740; 044-288-540-661-670; 046-841-674-135-16X; 050-101-745-005-68X; 055-788-708-180-492; 060-446-706-486-739; 070-165-651-115-034; 072-463-767-991-704; 078-448-638-876-294; 127-458-994-664-604; 132-884-081-878-424; 145-605-646-070-949,0

Design/methodology/approach – A survey of the strengths and limitations of citation-based indicators is combined with evidence about existing uses of wider impact data in the arts and humanities, with particular reference to the 2014 UK Research Excellence Framework. Findings – Data are already used as impact evidence in the arts and humanities but this practice should become more widespread. Practical implications – Arts and humanities researchers should be encouraged to think creatively about the kinds of data that they may be able to generate in support of the value of their research and should not rely upon standardised metrics. Originality/value – This paper combines practices emerging in the arts and humanities with research evaluation from a scientometric perspective to generate new recommendations.",71,,,https://emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JD-02-2015-0028 https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JD-02-2015-0028/full/html https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-02-2015-0028 http://crco.cssd.ac.uk/id/eprint/498/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74364031.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/jd-02-2015-0028,0,,10.1108/jd-02-2015-0028,1588207589,,000-215-471-218-689; 000-701-825-394-422; 001-056-408-180-308; 003-078-576-803-447; 007-795-098-160-316; 011-521-940-777-040; 012-899-257-322-472; 012-985-161-732-232; 013-525-736-972-288; 013-718-374-513-420; 015-883-899-751-431; 016-800-190-255-14X; 018-315-516-617-475; 019-549-905-486-905; 022-483-441-357-134; 022-518-667-086-127; 027-705-670-883-165; 028-593-154-415-675; 029-947-472-322-601; 030-774-201-524-060; 032-120-454-622-654; 035-067-893-395-886; 035-144-028-934-431; 035-267-155-186-149; 036-920-750-958-41X; 038-240-957-834-67X; 042-626-235-421-626; 044-513-348-328-390; 044-838-240-966-193; 045-611-992-576-93X; 051-871-595-629-987; 053-920-541-627-557; 058-914-133-640-307; 062-022-048-057-724; 062-173-396-255-135; 062-738-623-441-41X; 076-098-271-542-772; 078-762-062-751-821; 079-278-714-415-834; 081-564-516-227-727; 084-175-826-961-740; 091-805-525-900-415; 093-330-513-915-317; 094-974-909-348-830; 101-657-198-569-92X; 109-267-469-989-967; 111-259-512-571-251; 111-876-592-154-75X; 118-587-164-553-344; 125-751-364-116-072; 132-238-138-313-349; 132-884-081-878-424; 137-436-186-301-00X; 146-447-979-762-527; 146-939-011-547-471; 147-527-057-658-789; 150-848-734-857-343; 156-416-696-579-037; 168-054-815-560-161; 172-214-359-908-316,18

The TIAregistry.org project was designed to describe the contemporary profile, etiologic factors, and outcomes in patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke who receive care in health systems that now offer urgent evaluation by stroke specialists. MethodsWe recruited patients who had had a TIA or minor stroke within the previous 7 days. Sites were selected if they had systems dedicated to urgent evaluation of patients with TIA. We estimated the 1-year risk of stroke and of the composite outcome of stroke, an acute coronary syndrome, or death from cardiovascular causes. We also examined the association of the ABCD2 score for the risk of stroke (range, 0 [lowest risk] to 7 [highest risk]), findings on brain imaging, and cause of TIA or minor stroke with the risk of recurrent stroke over a ...",374,"Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality; Female; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient/complications; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Risk; Risk Factors; Stroke/etiology",,https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/619661 https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/publications/619661 https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1412981 http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1412981 https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2c2cb386-20e2-43dc-8ca6-04c64e4690be https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/619661 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27096581 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/77017415.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1412981,0,27096581,10.1056/nejmoa1412981,2339795684,,004-397-265-107-713; 014-961-697-672-924; 016-469-220-698-930; 017-581-894-055-698; 018-285-782-380-146; 023-573-642-215-39X; 029-729-916-368-016; 031-471-599-749-11X; 046-725-159-019-692; 048-579-090-707-904; 049-223-867-746-427; 067-618-124-834-847; 077-744-691-986-468; 081-753-140-701-867; 095-152-723-779-361; 095-918-002-696-845; 099-309-632-060-827; 110-434-209-219-14X; 114-103-697-396-32X; 116-084-373-762-41X; 127-224-637-765-165; 150-206-926-038-444; 154-298-947-564-765,172

This channel opens a new opportunity to measure the impact of social use of scholarly publications in social media (altmetrics) which supplements our understanding on the scholarly impact of publications (bibliometrics). Two different channels, social media and journal, are known to establish various citation patterns statistically. However, thematic difference between altmetrics and bibliometrics structurally and contextually is unknown. Therefore, we perform document co-citation network analysis for structural comparison and topic modeling for contextual comparison. We also suggest Spearman’s correlation for statistical comparison. A case study is done for the publications from Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology and the tweets mentioning the publications. We identified a weak correlation between scholarly impact and social use of these publications. We also found the structures of the traditional citations and Twitter citations share common but high interest in information retrieval system and impact analysis, while Twitter citations have diverse interest in data mining, network analysis, and information behavior as well. In addition, from content analysis, we found the two citation patterns to have both common and distinct characteristics. Specifically, the topics covered by both citation patterns show intersections and exclusive contexts. In conclusion, the traditional citation patterns and the Twitter citation patterns in Information Science are different statistically, structurally, and contextually.

The field of timing and time perception has witnessed tremendous growth and multidisciplinary interest in the recent years with the advent of modern neuroimaging and neurophysiological approaches. In this article, I used a data mining approach to analyze the timing literature published by a select group of researchers (n = 202) during the period 2000-2015 and highlight important reviews as well as empirical articles that meet the criterion of a minimum of 100 citations. The qualifying articles (n = 150) are listed in a table along with key details such as number of citations, names of authors, year and journal of publication as well as a short summary of the findings of each study. The results of such a data-driven approach to literature review not only serve as a useful resource to any researcher interested in timing, but also provides a means to evaluate key papers that have significantly influenced the field and summarize recent progress and popular research trends in the field. Additionally, such analyses provides food for thought about future scientific directions and raises important questions about improving organizational structures to boost open science and progress in the field. I discuss exciting avenues for future research that have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the neurobiology of timing, and propose the establishment of a new society to promote open science and collaborative work within the highly diverse and multidisciplinary community of researchers in the field of timing and time perception.",10,,,https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/publications/630591 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00330/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/87877835 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945625/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2016.00330/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00330/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82847821.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00330,0,27471445,10.3389/fnins.2016.00330,2470085208,PMC4945625,000-834-988-701-713; 001-156-714-394-37X; 004-948-181-796-257; 005-764-564-405-145; 007-292-929-089-350; 008-852-650-193-272; 011-432-515-912-139; 013-493-862-098-022; 014-027-440-367-649; 016-157-585-348-586; 019-393-032-993-802; 019-907-085-939-215; 019-976-800-475-106; 026-855-005-196-039; 026-873-661-316-069; 027-065-311-977-087; 029-554-153-566-468; 030-554-798-784-61X; 030-808-460-393-811; 033-421-481-865-227; 040-575-970-086-713; 042-547-996-791-204; 042-774-313-826-958; 048-607-955-741-120; 054-262-694-329-790; 055-851-515-383-962; 060-559-894-897-527; 061-381-296-273-328; 064-700-989-814-574; 065-272-050-892-113; 067-489-518-178-063; 070-033-192-490-403; 070-318-553-122-569; 072-266-931-273-497; 077-669-636-893-608; 077-737-207-556-306; 082-255-695-900-573; 083-569-951-314-812; 085-253-712-140-247; 087-919-992-206-677; 093-587-603-438-490; 097-552-247-503-684; 105-597-472-493-117; 111-244-645-631-981; 118-039-598-940-424; 118-150-151-586-786; 133-089-183-427-433; 135-654-207-256-336; 139-992-770-974-908; 140-845-115-330-650; 144-210-821-407-738; 155-582-266-217-914; 167-747-237-523-259,10

Method This qualitative study aimed to: a) understand the experience of stigma in people with IBD and whether stigma derives from the bowel disorder diagnosis or from related FI; b) understand how stigma affects social, personal and emotional wellbeing, and how people with IBD manage these issues. Using purposive stratified sampling, 40 members of a UK IBD charity were recruited. Participants self-identified as having FI or not, and feeling stigmatised or not. Stigma was described as: being, or feeling that you are being treated differently, feeling ashamed or guilty, worrying that others will find out about your illness, or that others will think badly of you because of your illness . Unstructured individual interviews took place in participants’ homes. Data were analysed using an interpretive method. Results Three themes emerged: Being in and out of control (emotional command of one’s situation), Relationships and Social Support (intimate, family and professional helping networks), and Mastery and Mediation (adjusting to/balancing demands of IBD and life). Stigma arises from both IBD and FI due to socio-cultural demands of physical control over bodily functions, causing distress and social isolation. Attitudes towards bodily fluids and functions learnt in childhood, personality, humour, mental health, and perspective affect the stigma experience. Adults who create robust support networks, develop a sense of emotional control, and gain mastery of their situation are more likely to become stigma-resilient over time. Conclusion Clinicians can identify the stigma-vulnerable by asking patients about childhood attitudes towards bodily functions, and assessing personality and self-efficacy mechanisms. Patients can be more rapidly helped towards stigma-resilience and normalisation by learning to assess disease-related risks, e.g. incontinence, and make contingency plans (achieving emotional control), by learning how to tell others about IBD to secure their help (actively seeking supportive relationships), and by learning to do things differently in order to achieve tasks (mastery of IBD and life). Further research is needed to develop stigma-reduction strategies to improve quality of life for people with IBD. Disclosure of interest None Declared. References Goffman E.

Así se encuentran dentro de estos productos libros, capítulos en libro, artículos científicos, artículos de divulgación, materiales de intervención psicosocial,  patentes, modelos, normas, software, artefactos de intervención social, acciones de apropiación social del conocimiento, participación en escenarios académicos y sociales de los productos de investigación, las acciones de transformación de política pública, como otros productos de innovación social y los procesos de formación asociados a la producción de investigación.; ; Luego, en este proceso de medición es necesario evaluar los productos y esto presenta un alto nivel de complejidad. Por ejemplo, en el caso de los artículos publicados en revistas tienen una evaluación más clara por cuanto los mismos deben pasar por procesos de valoración de pares y además, las revistas visibilizan la calidad mediante el reconocimiento que los investigadores dan a su trabajo expresado en los usos de estos contenidos. En este sentido, una revista con una alta citación de sus contenidos puede generar un indicador de la calidad de los artículos de la misma y los sistemas de información de citación o de descargas pueden darnos indicadores de esta dinámica de evaluación de la calidad de estos productos. Pero esta información no solo es utilizada para valorar los productos sino que además hay estudios que muestran el uso, validez de técnicas, tráfico de videos o impacto de ciertos contenidos sobre una comunidad (Haran & Poliakoff, 2011; Sugimoto et al., 2013; Thelwall, Haustein, Larivière, & Sugimoto, 2013).; ; Por otro lado y con un grado de complejidad mayor, la evaluación de los libros y capítulos en libro no pasan por los mismos sistemas de valoración y edición previa, lo que añade una distancia en términos de calidad percibida. Sin embargo, las editoriales se han dado cuenta hoy por hoy de la necesidad de contar con  procesos  transparentes y exigentes) de valoración por pares de los contenidos. Es por esta razón que en gran parte de los sistemas de valoración de productos que los artículos y los libros no tienen la misma asignación de valor.; La valoración de otras formas de producción como la presentación en eventos académicos o la presentación en medios de difusión puede resultar un poco más difusa, pues no todos los eventos académicos hacen evaluación por pares y los medios de comunicación no necesariamente deciden sus contenidos en relación con la calidad de la investigación si no por las dinámicas mediáticas que se escapan de la dinámica de la valoración académica. No obstante, estas actividades podrían tener una valoración en relación con la difusión y las descargas en la red a este tipo de contenidos y en las citaciones que se hacen de ese contenido no solo en el ámbito académicos, si no social (Thelwall et al., 2013). Además, dado que ha sido un campo creciente, debido a la facilidad en el acceso a la información, se han creado páginas que intentan evaluar los contenidos generados por fuera de sistemas tradicionales de producción textos escritos, como por ejemplo los blogs (Zivkovic, 2011).; ; Por otro lado, otros productos que pueden ser fácilmente valorables son las patentes; por cuanto pasan por procesos de evaluación y reconocimiento de pares. Por el contrario, es un poco más complejo valorar las intervenciones o las innovaciones sociales como las que se expresan en leyes o en documentos de política pública, ya que deberían tener un reconocimiento importante por el impacto que generan en la sociedad. No obstante, las dinámicas políticas no necesariamente toman en cuenta estos contenidos de incidencia social solo por la fuerza de los hallazgos académicos, sino por las consecuencias políticas o económicas de las mismas. En este sentido, informes de política pública o leyes que se logren con base en hallazgos de investigación deberían tener un peso significativo en la evaluación. Por otro lado están productos un poco más complejos de medir como los que están asociados a incorporar resultados de investigación a cambios en las dinámicas sociales en comunidades. Éstos son más difíciles de medir y valorar ya que no es posible  dar cuenta de la calidad de los mismos y de sus impactos. Por lo anterior, es claro que estamos ante el reto de encontrar formas de medir su utilidad, impacto y calidad.; Los procesos de formación pueden ser evaluados midiendo a los estudiantes en los proyectos y grupos de investigación y en el caso de procesos de formación en doctorado seguramente las tesis de maestría y doctorado pueden dar indicadores, tanto a corto como a largo plazo. Por ejemplo, algunos de estos tipos de productos terminan en libros y artículos en revistas generando más indicadores menos inmediatos. Pero, es necesario pensar el tema por cuanto la formación doctoral en contextos como el colombiano es incipiente y pueden existir centros de investigación que no están orientados a la formación y no podrían dar cuenta de su actividad en esta dimensión.; ; También, es necesario tener en cuenta que estos sistemas de medida deben compararse contra las dinámicas propias de cada una de las áreas de conocimiento. En este sentido, no es lo mismo evaluar los impactos de la biomedicina, que de la astronomía o de las ciencias sociales que de las humanidades. En el caso colombiano la producción de artículos en ciencias sociales registrados en Scopus es grande y está en crecimiento con relación a otras áreas del conocimiento , por lo tanto, no puede compararse si no contra sí misma. Así, las herramientas de contabilizar y visualizar la producción (en este caso Scopus) permiten ver este crecimiento contrario a lo que algunos académicos sin evidencia pueden llegar a afirmar. La estrategia de Scopus de inclusión de revistas de América Latina en forma exponencial y en especial de abrirle la puerta a las revistas de ciencias sociales y humanidades permite dar cuenta de las dinámicas de citación de estos productos en forma cada vez más fiable.; ; Por último y como una forma de recoger en muchos casos la discrepancia ante los sistemas de medición, es necesario que se evalúen los sistemas de ponderación de los productos y los pesos de los mismos. Al igual que las ventanas de evaluación temporal y de las limitaciones de los sistemas de registro, pues las fallas en estos sistemas de registro y ponderación pueden deslegitimar el sistema de valoración. En el caso colombiano, estas fallas, por lo general, han generado desconfianza y el sistema debería definir estrategias de ajuste y de mejoramiento en el proceso hasta que el mismo sea suficientemente robusto y confiable. Otro elemento adicional debería ser el comparar estos modelos de medición entre países (mediciones comparables a nivel internacional) para identificar las debilidades y las fortalezas como los impactos que ellos tienen sobre las dinámicas de producción académica.; Con todo lo anterior, lo que sí parece evidente es que no podemos escapar de los procesos de evaluación y que debemos contribuir a mejorar los mismos a estudiar sus impactos y a asegurar la calidad de los mismos, justificando y valorando su uso al interior de la comunidad académica y social.; ; Referencias; ; Haran, B., & Poliakoff, M.

Retrieved April 16, 2014, from http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/network-central/2011/10/19/what-is-researchblogging-org/Generally speaking, the measurement of products, researchers, or groups, is a complex process that may give rise to tensions, especially when considering that these measurements have economic and institutional implications.; ; The first step in the measurement process, in the case of scientific output, is to list the type of products that can account for academic activity and that may be subject to measurement indicators.  These include books, book chapters, scientific papers, divulgation papers, psychosocial intervention materials, patents, models, guidelines, software, social intervention artifacts, social knowledge appropriation actions, participation in academic and social events with research products, actions of public policy transformation, other social innovation products and the processes linked to the production of research.; ; The next step is to assess those products, which is a very complex matter.  For example, clear evaluation criteria are available for journal papers, since they need to undergo peer review and journals transform quality into visibility by taking advantage of the recognition that researchers give to them in terms of citations.  A journal with a high citation count can provide an indicator of its quality and information systems can also provide indications of these quality assessment dynamics.  This information is not only used to assess products but has also been used in studies about usage, techniques, video traffic or impact of certain contents in a community. (Haran & Poliakoff, 2011; Sugimoto et al., 2013; Thelwall, Haustein, Larivière, & Sugimoto, 2013).; ; On the other hand, and with a greater degree of complexity, assessing books and book chapters do not have the same systems of evaluation and edition, which decreases their perceived quality.  Nevertheless, publishing houses have realised that transparent and demanding assessment processes are needed.  This is why both assessment systems are not assigned the same value.; ; Giving value to other forms of production, such as presenting in academic events or in general mass media, may be a little more difficult, because not all academic events have peer reviewing processes and mass media do not necessarily choose what contents to publish based on the quality of the research but on their own dynamics, which are completely different from those found in academia.  However, these activities could be assessed by using download, diffusion and citation indicators both in academic and social settings (Thelwall et al., 2013).  With the associated growth in this field, new websites that attempt to assess the quality of the contents created outside traditional written production settings, such as blogs, have been created (Zivkovic, 2011).; Another type of product that can be easily evaluated is patents, since their assessment has a peer reviewing component.  Social interventions or innovations expressed in laws or public policy documents, however, are more difficult to assess, despite the important potential recognition they should have due to their impact on society.  Political dynamics do not necessarily take into account the research value of these contents despite their social incidence, but also their political or economical consequences.  In terms of assessment, reports on public policy or laws based on research findings should have a more significant weight.  Even more difficult would be to measure the impact of research findings on social dynamics within communities, since it is not easy to assess their quality and impact.  The challenge clearly is to find those ways of measuring usefulness, impact, and quality.; ; Educational processes can be assessed by measuring the performance of students in projects and research groups, and associated documents (master’s and doctoral theses), both in the short and long term.  Some of these products end up being part of books and journal papers, but the difficulty lies in the weight and maturity of these processes in certain contexts: for example, in the Colombian context, doctoral training is still incipient, and a number of research centres are not geared towards training and could not, therefore, account for their own activity in this dimension.; ; These measurement systems should compare their results within each field of knowledge and taking their own dynamics into account.  It is not the same to assess the impact of biomedicine or astronomy or social science, or the humanities.  In Colombia, the production in the field of social science recorded by Scopus is strong and growing more than other knowledge areas, and thus cannot be compared against any other field than itself.  The tools used to tally and visualise production (Scopus in this case) allow us to observe this growth and counter the arguments of some academics that state otherwise without evidence.  Scopus’ strategy of covering Latin American journals, and especially of opening its doors to the Social Sciences and the Humanities, enables us to monitor their citation dynamics in an increasingly reliable way.; ; A final step would be to revise the processes of weighting products, the assessment windows and the limitations of recording systems, because failures in these systems and in the weighting process may contribute to reduce the perceived quality of the assessment system.  In Colombia, these problems have created a lack of trust in the system, and adjustment and improvement strategies should be implemented until the whole process is robust and reliable.  Another element is to compare these models of measuring the performance of countries to identify strengths and weaknesses, along with the impacts on academic output.; ; What is ultimately self-evident is that we cannot seem to escape assessment processes and that we need to contribute to improve them, to enhance their impact and their quality, and to justify and value their use within academic and social communities.; ; References; ; Haran, B., & Poliakoff, M.

Bibliometric data from endodontic articles and journals with an altmetric score &gt;5 (top 5%) were retrieved from PubMed and analysed using the VOSviewer.

More recently they are moving toward Open science and are identified as one of the main stakeholders in promoting visibility and access of locally-produced scholarship by developing innovative digital publishing service, as well as providing support and guidance on tools and practices in the new open science environment. In line with these open access practices, the IRPPS e-Publishing service was developed with the aim of managing and disseminating its in-house publications. Launched in 2012, the service currently hosts two series – IRPPS Monographs and IRPPS Working Papers – and uses an open source software (Open Journal Systems, OJS) that supports every stage of the publishing process, including the peer-review process. At the beginning of the project a range of services was also developed to assure a uniform and transparent editorial process such as guidelines for submission, editorial and publishing policies aligned with international developments etc. In addition, for each published product a persistent identifier and long-term preservation in the CNR institutional repository, as well as indexing procedures in disciplinary archives and/or academic publishing search engines (i.e. Google Scholar, RePEc, etc.), have been provided contributing to increased availability and visibility of IRPPS scientific outputs. Six years after its launch, it is necessary to make an assessment on strengths and weaknesses of the project. For these reasons the paper intends to describe the analysis carried out to evaluate its impact on both the production of the Institute’s scientific outputs and on their visibility. In particular our object is to investigate the relation between the editorial quality of products connected with already implemented publishing tools (editorial scientific board, international bibliographic codes, copyright/ creative commons etc.) and their impact on managerial, organizational and diffusion activities.  For these reasons we analysed the characteristics of published contents in terms of number and type of material, publishing practices and usage statistics. This analysis allows us to gain insight of trends in the increase of published products as well as changes in the types of publications, while publishing practices provide indications on co-authorship and internal and external networking, among other things. This allows us to verify to what extent the editorial improvements introduced by the development of an e-Publishing service have attracted authors to choose this platform to disseminate their work in an open access mode. This is crucial in our case given that the production in Humanities and Social sciences is more locally oriented and mainly monograph-based. Moreover, usage statistics on the basis of data provided by Google analytics and OJS statistical reports, helps analysing readership as well as type of use of IRPPS research products also comparing these results with access of papers previously available on the institutional web page. This analysis provides the basis for the implementation of innovative publishing tools such as altmetrics, and other quantitative and qualitative impact metrics, such as those linked to academic social networks. Moreover, indications from this review can drive the development of an editorial plan related to the digitization of previously published works that have represented important achievements of IRPPS research results. These additional services and the digitization project help and contribute to a larger diffusion and visibility of the scientific research products as well as to a better evaluation process through the use and improvement of alternative metrics together with traditional ones .",,,,https://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/SCS/article/download/4532/4215,http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/5.4532,0,,10.7557/5.4532,2900508619,,,0

Since launching in 2012, Altmetric.com collects online metrics and metadata around millions of digital research and communications outputs ranging from press releases to peer reviewed journal publications. Using automated and manual data gathering techniques, we have conducted sentiment and stakeholder affiliation analyses of data from the National Institutes for Occupation Health and Safety to help identify key stakeholder networks in the OSH community, how they engage, what platforms they use, and what they’re saying. Methods We reviewed NIOSH attention data across the 16 platforms Altmetric tracks using the Altmetric Explorer platform. We grouped those platforms into ‘red flag’ and ‘green flag’ platforms with distinct sentiment patterns. Red flag platforms were platforms were the sentiment was most likely to be negative or critical. Green flag platforms were platforms where qualitative engagement was most likely to be positive. Blue flag platforms had no sentiment and simply provided findings without editorialising about them. Results NIOSH’s break out using this flagging system was unique and broke out as follows. Red flags included blogs, Reddit, and peer review sites. News, Twitter, and Wikipedia tend to have non-editorialised reporting of NIOSH communications and solely need to be monitored for accuracy – blue flag platforms. Green flag platforms with high positive sentiment likelihood include F1000, Facebook, YouTube, policy and syllabi citations. Stakeholder analysis is ongoing of who engages on these platforms is ongoing and may not be ready for this presentation. Conclusions Peer-reviewed OSH journal literature and web-native digital communications are underserved by existing metrics like citations and web analytics. New web-based alternative metrics and provide deep qualitative data on what communities are being reach, when, on what platforms, and what the content of their engagement is.

Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and many other social networking sites allow users to share and interact with online content and to connect with like-minded people. Its strengths – rapid dissemination and amplification of content and the ability to lead informal conversations – make it a powerful tool to use in a professional context. This commentary explains the overall concept of social media and offers suggestions on usage and possible types of scientific content. It advises researchers on the potential benefits and how to take a strategic approach towards building a social media presence. It also presents examples of effective social media use within the plant science community. Common reasons for scientists to not engage with social media include the fear of appearing unprofessional, posting something wrong or being misunderstood, or a lack of confidence in their computer skills.

This paper presents the first Semantometric measure, which estimates the research contribution. We measure semantic similarity of publications connected in a citation network and use a simple formula to assess their contribution. We carry out a pilot study in which we test our approach on a small dataset and discuss the challenges in carrying out the analysis on existing citation datasets. The results suggest that semantic similarity measures can be utilised to provide meaningful information about the contribution of research papers that is not captured by traditional impact measures based purely on citations.",20,,,http://oro.open.ac.uk/42527/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82980098 http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november14/knoth/11knoth.html https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4867963 https://www.epistemio.com/p/Yc2c69dA,http://oro.open.ac.uk/42527/,0,,,2081038225,,,11

For 29 authors--11 of which are considered as young and 18 as established authors--the h values for Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) and the hmen value for Mendeley have been derived. In order to find out about the reliability of the hmen index as an indicator to assess scholarly impact, a correlation analysis between the indices has been conducted. Furthermore, the index values were divided by the scientific ages of the authors in order to obtain time-oriented h and hmen values which make a comparison of authors with different scientific ages possible. The hmen index was found to have very strong positive and highly significant correlations of around 0.95 with each of the h indices. Time-oriented values showed the faster reception of scientific work via Mendeley in comparison to citation counts and revealed exceptional authors who were found to have rather young scientific ages.",117,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v117y2018i1d10.1007_s11192-018-2882-8.html https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3275995 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-018-2882-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2882-8,0,,10.1007/s11192-018-2882-8,2887641269,,004-712-779-814-551; 004-924-180-697-031; 010-057-293-861-47X; 012-189-268-758-160; 024-371-923-234-248; 024-704-447-017-762; 027-654-899-348-999; 035-964-848-340-165; 044-159-460-387-228; 050-795-585-993-189; 065-828-816-371-612; 066-507-313-507-599; 072-463-767-991-704; 101-752-490-869-458; 122-073-156-920-876; 123-612-630-601-781; 127-458-994-664-604; 143-820-904-820-853; 151-479-337-995-684; 154-624-043-536-340; 162-106-065-447-226; 170-943-882-378-660,0

This article assesses whether Altmetric.com scores are reliable early indicators of likely future impact and whether they may also reflect non-scholarly impacts. A preliminary factor analysis suggests that the main altmetric indicator of scholarly impact is Mendeley reader counts, with weaker news, informational and social network discussion/promotion dimensions in some fields. Based on a regression analysis of Altmetric.com data from November 2015 and Scopus citation counts from October 2017 for articles in 30 narrow fields, only Mendeley reader counts are consistent predictors of future citation impact. Most other Altmetric.com scores can help predict future impact in some fields. Overall, the results confirm that early Altmetric.com scores can predict later citation counts, although less well than journal impact factors, and the optimal strategy is to consider both Altmetric.com scores and journal impact factors.

Graham; Philippe Ravaud; Isabelle Boutron,"Summary The biomedical research complex has been estimated to consume almost a quarter of a trillion US dollars every year. Unfortunately, evidence suggests that a high proportion of this sum is avoidably wasted. In 2014, The Lancet published a series of five reviews showing how dividends from the investment in research might be increased from the relevance and priorities of the questions being asked, to how the research is designed, conducted, and reported. 17 recommendations were addressed to five main stakeholders—funders, regulators, journals, academic institutions, and researchers. This Review provides some initial observations on the possible effects of the Series, which seems to have provoked several important discussions and is on the agendas of several key players. Some examples of individual initiatives show ways to reduce waste and increase value in biomedical research. This momentum will probably move strongly across stakeholder groups, if collaborative relationships evolve between key players; further important work is needed to increase research value.

Our dataset reflects that outputs with “digital humanities” in their metadata were not published in fully-fledged Open Access journals. The role of SSRN and arXiv as open repositories was found to be relatively significant, but the licensing of the outputs available through them was not always immediately clearly displayed. Our working definition of ""Open Access"" requires outputs to be open for human and machine access through CC-BY or at least CC-BY-SA. The absence of clear licensing information at output level is perceived to be problematic, as is the lack of any outputs clearly and visibly licensed with CC-BY. The fact the 3 most-mentioned outputs in the dataset were available without a paywall might signal towards the potential of Open Access for greater public impact. ‘Free access’ outputs in paywalled journals did not reflect higher mentions nor citations than their paywalled or non-paywalled counterparts.

As revistas científicas de acesso aberto têm, potencialmente, maior chance de serem compartilhadas e lidas pelo público nas redes sociais. Nesse cenário, a produção científica do Brasil e da América Latina, a exemplo daquelas indexadas no SciELO, que reúne revistas científicas relevantes e de acesso aberto da região, poderiam se beneficiar da altmetria. No entanto, análises sobre a representatividade de países, idiomas e áreas do conhecimento na altmetria revelam que é preciso aperfeiçoar os indicadores para que valorizem a ciência publicada por países em desenvolvimento, de língua não inglesa, de acesso aberto e relevância nacional ou regional. Tendo isso como base, este paper aponta limitações da altmetria para a ciência praticada na América Latina, tomando como análise o comportamento de uso de redes sociais de acadêmicos e sociedade em geral, a presença de diferentes idiomas para compartilhar artigos de um mesmo tema, bem como os dados de plataformas que geram dados altmétricos, com enfoque para a provedora de dados inglesa Altmetric.com. A altmetria não tem sido capaz de retratar a atenção que artigos científicos brasileiros recebem nas redes sociais, apesar de haver esforços por parte das revistas em divulgação científica e do relativo engajamento social que conseguem mobilizar. É preciso ampliar a coleta de dados no Facebook, em português e espanhol, além de amplificar as coleções de blogs e veículos jornalísticos na região.</jats:p>",31,,,https://app.uff.br/riuff/bitstream/1/7927/1/RESUMO_LEIAUTADO_Germana%20Barata.pdf http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0103-37862019000100313&lng=en http://www.scielo.br/pdf/tinf/v31/2318-0889-tinf-31-e190031.pdf https://app.uff.br/riuff/handle/1/7927,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/2318-0889201931e190031,0,,10.1590/2318-0889201931e190031,2937701261,,001-976-473-572-537; 009-181-564-606-052; 010-418-270-613-554; 017-565-653-433-651; 025-352-608-374-964; 028-584-239-706-303; 033-518-090-321-581; 040-252-626-797-747; 045-452-851-160-660; 053-625-154-719-011; 067-907-728-257-412; 069-622-741-632-33X; 079-614-925-943-127; 080-995-379-308-35X; 098-761-314-823-07X; 127-629-838-081-152; 141-212-834-542-277,0

To examine whether releasing a preprint on bioRxiv was associated with the attention and citations received by the corresponding peer-reviewed article, we assembled a dataset of 74,239 articles, 5,405 of which had a preprint, published in 39 journals. Using log-linear regression and random-effects meta-analysis, we found that articles with a preprint had, on average, a 49% higher Altmetric Attention Score and 36% more citations than articles without a preprint. These associations were independent of several other article- and author-level variables (such as scientific subfield and number of authors), and were unrelated to journal-level variables such as access model and Impact Factor.

For maximum societal effect, this engagement needs to occur both within the research process and throughout the complex process of knowledge transfer. The authors propose that a relational engagement approach to research impact complements and builds on traditional approaches. Traditional approaches to impact employ bibliometric measures and focus on the creation and use of journal articles by scholarly audiences, an important but incomplete part of the academic process. The authors recommend expanding the strategies and measures of impact to include process assessments for specific stakeholders across the entire course of impact, from the creation, awareness, and use of knowledge to societal impact. This relational engagement approach involves the cocreation of research with audiences beyond academia. The authors hope to begin a dialogue on the strategies...",36,,,https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/assessing-the-societal-impact-of-research-the-relational-engagement-approach(b141d2e8-cdc2-4b8f-9c60-57dbbaa46cc2).html https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2763096_code1875363.pdf?abstractid=2759467&mirid=2 https://research.aalto.fi/en/publications/assessing-the-societal-impact-of-research(c38e17fe-065f-44f4-9e27-7d7b8f22d36c).html http://journals.ama.org/doi/pdf/10.1509/jppm.14.121 http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/121052318/2016_Ozanne_Davis_et_al_Relational_Engagement_JPPM.pdf https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/files/121052318/2016_Ozanne_Davis_et_al_Relational_Engagement_JPPM.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2759467 http://research.gold.ac.uk/25515/ http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1127920 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jppm.14.121 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74404568.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jppm.14.121,0,,10.1509/jppm.14.121,2313928532,,001-102-687-410-229; 001-123-056-238-680; 001-528-577-998-365; 001-924-869-985-00X; 003-662-782-068-415; 005-671-468-082-208; 007-278-914-135-069; 010-930-773-700-687; 011-219-275-794-010; 011-298-394-851-629; 012-102-758-467-687; 012-858-584-215-032; 015-373-923-358-905; 016-186-444-253-762; 022-906-153-235-265; 022-921-163-084-11X; 024-581-946-291-179; 025-499-212-434-285; 025-796-218-485-922; 030-567-973-873-808; 031-520-638-064-075; 032-616-669-645-596; 033-315-831-453-953; 035-374-124-957-848; 035-887-732-683-602; 035-929-621-520-483; 040-802-578-229-051; 041-005-463-173-275; 041-108-533-753-69X; 042-336-918-586-205; 044-910-834-598-889; 045-703-255-649-981; 047-771-841-080-916; 048-289-073-109-94X; 049-367-465-900-607; 053-216-034-098-495; 053-366-483-915-829; 057-264-525-180-508; 059-930-532-241-764; 064-131-372-711-228; 064-619-520-365-224; 065-391-814-184-961; 066-170-045-833-919; 070-630-153-926-708; 073-936-752-624-550; 078-476-542-216-396; 079-692-467-708-894; 080-464-229-293-196; 081-273-058-103-558; 087-772-201-687-029; 089-631-589-162-248; 091-679-618-174-083; 093-005-645-084-755; 096-157-238-152-177; 096-814-568-019-747; 097-080-683-054-595; 099-717-775-076-730; 101-752-490-869-458; 102-735-977-794-947; 104-993-237-326-093; 109-328-459-920-639; 118-130-945-941-470; 120-098-990-094-404; 123-524-732-093-028; 129-732-030-970-65X; 140-775-435-947-544; 141-599-269-507-004; 146-433-173-921-624; 151-110-498-246-035; 156-826-355-603-627; 165-907-153-473-247; 168-141-550-728-541; 172-780-298-195-696,28

A special methodology based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient was developed for this purpose. In the case of publications, the correlation between the citedness of a publication (the value of the TC field in the SCI-E DB) and its usage (fields U1 and U2) was evaluated. In the case of source journals for the indicated publications, the correlation was determined between the Cited_Half-Life value and the values of journal-usage metrics, which were determined as the mean U1 (U2) value taken for all publications of the journal. It was established that the nature of journal distribution according to the Cited_Half-Life value of the source journals for Russian publications practically coincides with the nature of the distribution of source journals for publications of the entire global flow: the Russian distribution shifted somewhat toward larger Cited_Half-Life values (the median of the global distribution was 6.1, while that of the Russian distribution was 6.2). This shift increased sharply upon considering the number of Russian and global journal publications, respectively (the median of the global distribution was 5.8, while that of the Russian distribution was 6.8).",52,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S0005105518020061,http://dx.doi.org/10.3103/s0005105518020061,0,,10.3103/s0005105518020061,2808466676,,003-034-665-176-76X; 023-271-041-203-090; 033-518-090-321-581; 033-812-042-547-196; 066-893-762-692-820; 093-664-234-944-828; 103-594-408-373-034; 122-073-156-920-876; 127-458-994-664-604,0

In addition, the number and type of corneal transplantations performed globally indicate that current practices are disproportionately skewed in favor of endothelial keratoplasty, which is targeted for the pathology prevalent in developed countries. Despite the large number of individuals who would benefit from anterior lamellar keratoplasty, this technique seems to be infrequently performed.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Most corneal blindness worldwide is secondary to anterior corneal pathology because of infections and trauma. However, this does not align with the current trends and practices in the field of corneal transplantation.

However, no study has focused on their potential usefulness to capture the impact of scholarly books. While recent literature shows that citation indicators cannot fully capture the impact of books, other studies have suggested alternative indicators such as usage, publishers' prestige or library holdings. In this paper, we calculate 18 indicators which range from altmetrics to library holdings, views, downloads or citations to the production of monographs of a Spanish university using the bibliometric suite PlumX from EBSCO. The objective of the study is to adopt a multidimensional perspective on the analysis of books and understand the level of complementarity between these different indicators. Also, we compare the overview offered by this range of indicators when applied to monographs with the traditional bibliometric perspective focused on journal articles and citation impact. We observe a low presence of altmetric indicators for monographs, even lower than for journal articles and a predominance of library holdings, confirming this indicator as the most promising one towards the analysis of the impact of books.",113,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1710.html#abs-1710-00368 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3168618 https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/161680 http://www.ingenio.upv.es/es/publications/filling-citation-gap-measuring-multidimensional-impact-academic-book-institutional https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v113y2017i3d10.1007_s11192-017-2539-z.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2539-z https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2539-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2539-z,0,,10.1007/s11192-017-2539-z,2763016373,,000-792-009-951-071; 000-859-640-631-508; 001-788-981-268-621; 002-181-962-982-139; 006-765-540-084-51X; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-998-283-383-315; 010-418-270-613-554; 017-141-061-884-548; 017-349-318-774-487; 018-590-173-884-235; 019-120-240-188-628; 019-549-905-486-905; 021-845-167-153-321; 024-704-447-017-762; 027-205-205-984-47X; 030-074-128-354-124; 030-797-455-527-546; 033-534-192-327-546; 035-988-212-620-838; 038-972-526-389-790; 044-516-795-035-024; 046-552-857-552-176; 056-764-246-223-493; 065-813-744-561-991; 066-507-313-507-599; 080-980-582-763-540; 085-211-231-477-329; 109-390-765-723-243; 110-566-203-064-997; 111-876-592-154-75X; 112-060-776-316-965; 114-569-399-530-919; 116-632-637-088-735; 119-099-910-970-312; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 130-697-299-998-916; 137-436-186-301-00X; 139-605-789-723-604; 140-750-789-105-933; 143-804-082-399-413; 145-175-085-754-752; 170-103-845-444-719; 174-743-361-740-440; 177-787-582-091-521,7

By drawing attention to the way in which the researcher is asked to understand herself in this policy context, Hodgson illustrates how particular technologies of performance measurement and management, and of publication, enter the researcher into this economy of visibility.

A new Web-based metric (Altmetrics) has recently been developed for use in scientific fields. The aim of this study was to determine which recent papers in the field of stroke have received the greatest amount of attention from the general public. The Altmetric Attention Score is an automatically calculated metric for monitoring social media. Patients and methods An Altmetric Explorer search was performed on May 25, 2018 to extract the following information: (i) journal name, (ii) journal impact factor (IF), (iii) year of publication, (iv) article topic, (v) article type, and (vi) stroke subtype. Results The journal that published articles that received the most attention on social media was Stroke ( n  = 16). Articles with higher IFs are not expected to receive greater attention on social media. Twenty-one of the identified articles related to the subtypes of ischemic stroke. Regarding contents, approximately half of the top-10 ranked articles were about modifiable risk factors, especially diet and physical activities. Two recent articles on the extension of mechanical thrombectomy after 6 h were included on this list. Conclusions There are some discrepancies in perspectives between scientific articles and general social media, and the Altmetric Attention Score is considered to more dynamically reflect the interests of the general public. We therefore suggest that physicians can use Altmetric analysis to identify what the general public actually wants to know about in the real world, while they should also have a critical view of the social media that attracts the public with a stimulating theme rather than a worthy subject.",183,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846719301829,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2019.105386,0,31207458,10.1016/j.clineuro.2019.105386,2950658398,,002-339-262-577-367; 006-733-709-038-484; 008-311-188-212-813; 008-387-332-479-776; 011-840-304-958-033; 012-589-114-795-041; 012-641-115-857-887; 013-569-894-506-447; 014-840-398-212-441; 019-036-823-242-954; 019-701-494-134-123; 023-724-160-874-777; 025-608-623-546-636; 030-607-833-134-935; 036-209-894-183-911; 037-550-741-315-579; 039-031-119-791-020; 045-784-030-723-340; 047-129-082-298-405; 053-675-116-280-971; 059-448-448-914-844; 061-442-173-260-603; 063-532-277-943-208; 084-356-750-358-63X; 087-283-220-903-885; 104-373-159-406-399; 104-409-531-654-308; 113-719-313-739-776; 114-279-939-771-823; 119-160-815-430-107,1

Second, we estimate the coverage of Zenodo datasets in the Data Citation Index (DCI) as well as of Zenodo journal articles in the Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI), Zenodo books and book chapters in the Book Citation Index, and Zenodo conference papers in the Proceedings Citation Index, and analyse their citedness according to the different data record types in Zenodo (e.g., journal article, dataset, book, or conference paper). Third, we provide a bibliometric analysis of Zenodo records by using different metrics for citedness, including citation, usage and altmetrics. Altmetrics data are gathered from two of the most popular tools for altmetric analyses, PlumX and Altmetric.com, and we compare the results.

Hemminger,"Although many observers have advocated the reform of the scholarly publishing system, improvements to functions like peer review have been adopted sluggishly. We argue that this is due to the tight coupling of the journal system: the system's essential functions of archiving, registration, dissemination, and certification are bundled together and siloed into tens of thousands of individual journals. This tight coupling makes it difficult to change any one aspect of the system, choking out innovation. We suggest that the solution is the “decoupled journal (DcJ).” In this system, the functions are unbundled and performed as services, able to compete for patronage and evolve in response to the market. For instance, a scholar might deposit an article in her institutional repository, have it copyedited and typeset by one company, indexed for search by several others, self-marketed over her own social networks, and peer reviewed by one or more stamping agencies that connect her paper to external reviewers. The DcJ brings publishing out of its current seventeenth-century paradigm, and creates a Web-like environment of loosely joined pieces—a marketplace of tools that, like the Web, evolves quickly in response to new technologies and users' needs. Importantly, this system is able to evolve from the current one, requiring only the continued development of bolt-on services external to the journal, particularly for peer review.",6,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3319915 http://ils.unc.edu/bmh/pubs/2012-JNeuroScience-DecoupledJournals.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319915/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full https://core.ac.uk/display/26388493 https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019 http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82883454.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2012.00019,0,22493574,10.3389/fncom.2012.00019,2144816075,PMC3319915,000-073-326-255-503; 000-811-804-742-157; 002-083-276-877-890; 004-047-050-661-725; 010-683-448-555-310; 013-803-923-857-012; 015-167-238-350-852; 016-410-890-769-527; 020-887-337-101-946; 026-390-265-679-654; 026-690-594-587-368; 033-002-991-408-580; 033-830-040-690-967; 047-681-216-864-134; 049-012-192-454-37X; 049-354-101-963-831; 051-715-084-852-162; 051-975-444-655-324; 057-040-097-643-496; 057-413-289-854-641; 064-816-983-473-195; 066-938-845-178-663; 071-000-280-339-530; 073-020-817-673-290; 075-676-070-584-664; 081-389-266-241-482; 083-077-687-574-891; 085-001-502-383-40X; 087-232-129-977-875; 089-660-550-933-845; 095-942-610-957-279; 102-276-478-923-871; 103-230-414-005-804; 103-624-996-194-984; 118-642-807-049-571; 123-687-398-098-005; 126-691-175-775-620; 130-021-207-761-445; 137-049-411-575-542; 138-732-872-483-934; 151-500-289-522-439; 152-988-229-115-477; 159-139-684-428-246; 167-502-560-599-346; 172-807-061-309-058; 175-067-678-330-680; 176-901-628-233-581; 186-570-040-418-496; 191-729-924-205-157,43

The term altmetrics was coined by Jason Priem in 2010, as a generalization of article level metrics, and rooted in the twitter #altmetrics hashtag. Although altmetrics usually functions as metrics about articles, but it can also be applied to people, journals, books, data sets, presentations, videos, source code repositories, web pages, etc. Altmetrics does not cover just citation counts, but also other aspects of the impact of a work, such as how many data and knowledge bases refer to it, article views, download, or mentions in social media and news media. In this paper, the altmetric scores of top-cited altmetric papers are presented. Also, the contents of the same are analysed and presented. It is interesting to note that all top-cited papers appeared from diverse subject domains, i.e. big data in science, biological science, medical science, research methodology, social studies, citation studies and scientometrics, different issues involved in social networking et al. The subject domain altmetrics is a highly interdisciplinary field covering all major areas of universe of knowledge. This study reflects other notable feature, i.e. the discord between traditional metric (times cited) and modern metric (altmetric score).",54,,,http://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/srels/article/view/16169 http://www.i-scholar.in/index.php/sjim/article/view/148183 http://www.srels.org/index.php/sjim/article/view/111346,http://dx.doi.org/10.17821/srels/2017/v54i2/111346,0,,10.17821/srels/2017/v54i2/111346,2617944293,,,0

Sathianathen; Robert Lane; Benjamin Condon; Declan Murphy; Nathan Lawrentschuk; Christopher J. Weight; Alastair D. Lamb,"Abstract Background The scientific impact of published articles has traditionally been measured as citation counts. However, there has been a shift in academia to a digitalized age in which research is widely read, disseminated, and discussed online. As part of this shift, each published article has a digital footprint. Objective To develop a urology social media score (#UroSoMe_Score) to predict citation counts from measures of online attention for urological articles. Design, setting, and participants We included articles published between June 2016 and June 2017 in the top ten highest-impact urology journals. We obtained data on the online attention received by each of these articles from Altmetric Explorer and 2-yr citation counts from Scopus. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis We created a multivariable linear model using the forward stepwise regression method based on the Akaike information criterion to determine the best-fitting model using online sources of attention to predict 2-yr citation count. Results and limitations We included a total of 2033 urology articles. The median weighted Altmetric score for the articles included was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 2–11). The median number of citations for all articles included was 7 (IQR 3–14). There was an association between Altmetric score and 2-yr Scopus citation count (p  Conclusions The #UroSoMe_Score can be used to predict 2-yr citation counts for urological publications on the basis of online metrics. Patient summary Online measures of attention can be used to predict citation counts and thus the scientific impact of an article. Our #UroSoMe_Score can be used in such a manner specifically for the urological literature. Outliers may still be present especially for popular topics that receive online attention but are not heavily cited.",,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405456919303372 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31704280 https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/publications/1072566,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2019.10.015,0,31704280,10.1016/j.euf.2019.10.015,2988748790,,001-230-855-524-978; 002-140-827-871-048; 003-685-789-337-35X; 016-292-994-688-700; 019-211-439-640-128; 019-532-553-629-691; 022-346-736-646-83X; 022-415-488-851-186; 024-607-783-552-938; 033-892-099-999-989; 034-061-384-808-888; 036-245-655-074-679; 039-436-435-369-054; 047-436-441-352-101; 049-902-212-921-284; 050-252-270-491-60X; 060-449-724-002-033; 090-664-090-965-558; 099-101-274-546-065; 147-715-310-055-120; 150-608-950-976-109; 159-843-129-711-033,0

Michener,"Data sharing is the practice of making data available for use by others. Ecologists are increasingly generating and sharing an immense volume of data. Such data may serve to augment existing data collections and can be used for synthesis efforts such as meta-analysis, for parameterizing models, and for verifying research results (i.e., study reproducibility). Large volumes of ecological data may be readily available through institutions or data repositories that are the most comprehensive available and can serve as the core of ecological analysis. Ecological data are also employed outside the research context and are used for decision-making, natural resource management, education, and other purposes. Data sharing has a long history in many domains such as oceanography and the biodiversity sciences (e.g., taxonomic data and museum specimens), but has emerged relatively recently in the ecological sciences.; ; A review of several of the large international and national ecological research programs that have emerged since the mid-1900s highlights the initial failures and more recent successes as well as the underlying causes—from a near absence of effective policies to the emergence of community and data sharing policies coupled with the development and adoption of data and metadata standards and enabling tools. Sociocultural change and the move towards more open science have evolved more rapidly over the past two decades in response to new requirements set forth by governmental organizations, publishers and professional societies. As the scientific culture has changed so has the cyberinfrastructure landscape. The introduction of community-based data repositories, data and metadata standards, software tools, persistent identifiers, and federated search and discovery have all helped promulgate data sharing. Nevertheless, there are many challenges and opportunities especially as we move towards more open science. Cyberinfrastructure challenges include a paucity of easy-to-use metadata management systems, significant difficulties in assessing data quality and provenance, and an absence of analytical and visualization approaches that facilitate data integration and harmonization. Challenges and opportunities abound in the sociocultural arena where funders, researchers, and publishers all have a stake in clarifying policies, roles and responsibilities, as well as in incentivizing data sharing. A set of best practices and examples of software tools are presented that can enable research transparency, reproducibility and new knowledge by facilitating idea generation, research planning, data management and the dissemination of data and results.",29,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.06.010 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.06.010 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954115001004 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5380567 https://core.ac.uk/display/82649866 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954115001004 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/965082 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82649866.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.06.010,0,,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2015.06.010,855927983,,000-460-248-874-068; 000-785-692-812-344; 002-008-275-564-489; 002-529-954-588-662; 003-163-340-185-642; 003-704-506-709-67X; 005-223-982-662-222; 008-308-648-745-817; 010-245-124-964-548; 011-117-051-321-68X; 016-785-658-585-687; 018-659-672-812-247; 019-270-646-359-048; 023-153-372-133-472; 023-292-477-096-356; 026-968-798-068-168; 030-947-342-947-510; 032-199-420-549-748; 033-652-163-840-006; 037-430-774-662-415; 043-767-734-196-051; 046-126-847-185-673; 046-276-807-841-668; 046-964-815-745-624; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-943-849-598-815; 053-289-258-229-404; 053-739-159-229-535; 054-717-334-329-859; 057-880-055-016-031; 064-142-249-606-389; 066-632-678-242-696; 068-047-277-291-425; 068-091-532-039-525; 068-225-092-638-903; 069-592-994-536-755; 070-759-535-665-352; 070-885-958-039-780; 071-531-300-366-185; 073-565-069-110-862; 074-614-949-934-346; 075-165-069-477-023; 077-727-195-189-342; 079-458-629-595-867; 080-069-929-066-568; 082-770-706-465-260; 086-358-651-150-069; 089-925-435-581-507; 093-596-001-887-058; 097-048-373-437-646; 098-803-339-390-250; 098-902-200-743-078; 104-708-384-355-075; 112-676-267-621-641; 114-539-697-740-140; 121-545-745-536-510; 125-241-332-112-317; 130-209-356-305-851; 153-839-089-569-30X; 169-903-257-446-232; 179-223-065-594-04X; 181-168-112-500-206; 189-633-705-621-830; 190-759-846-723-450,76

La Torre; I. Sciarra; Marta Chiappetta; A. Monteduro,"IntroductionBibliometrics is a science which evaluates the impact of the scientific work of a journal or of an author, using mathematical and statistical tools. Impact Factor (IF) is the first bibliometric parameter created, and after it many others have been progressively conceived in order to go beyond its limits. Currently bibliometric indexes are used for academic purposes, among them to evaluate the eligibility of a researcher to compete for the National Scientific Qualification, in order to access to competitive exams to become professor.; ObjectiveAim of this study is to identify the most relevant bibliometric indexes and to summarized their characteristics. Methods. A revision of bibliometric indexes as been conducted, starting from the classic ones and completing with the most recent ones.; ResultsThe two most used bibliometric indexes are the IF, which measures the scientific impact of a periodical and bases on Web of Science citation database, and the h-index, which measures the impact of the scientific work of a researcher, basing on Scopus database. Besides them other indexes have been created more recently, such as the SCImago Journal Rank Indicator (SJR), the Source Normalised Impact per Paper (SNIP) and the CiteScore index. They are all based on Scopus database and evaluate, in different ways, the citational impact of a periodic. The i10-index instead is provided from Google Scholar database and allows to evaluate the impact of the scientific production of a researcher. Recently two softwares have been introduced: the first one, Publish or Perish, allows to evaluate the scientific work of a researcher, through the assessment of many indexes; the second one, Altmetric, measure the use in the Web of the academic papers, instead of measuring citations, by means of alternative metrics respect to the traditional ones.; ConclusionsEach analized index shows advantages but also criticalities. Therefore the combined use of more than one indexes, citational and not, should be preferred, in order to correctly evaluate the work of reserchers and to finally improve the quality and the development of scientific research",168,Bibliometrics; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Science,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28383616 http://www.clinicaterapeutica.it/ojs/index.php/ClinicaTerapeutica/article/view/12 http://www.clinicaterapeutica.it/ojs/index.php/ClinicaTerapeutica/article/download/12/11,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28383616,0,28383616,,2794835472,,,3

Rosenkrantz; Abimbola Ayoola; Kush Singh; Richard Duszak,"Rationale and Objectives; Emerging alternative metrics leverage social media and other online platforms to provide immediate measures of biomedical articles' reach among diverse public audiences. We aimed to compare traditional citation and alternative impact metrics for articles in popular general radiology journals.; Materials and Methods; All 892 original investigations published in 2013 issues of Academic Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, Journal of the American College of Radiology, and Radiology were included. Each article's content was classified as imaging vs nonimaging. Traditional journal citations to articles were obtained from Web of Science. Each article's Altmetric Attention Score (Altmetric), representing weighted mentions across a variety of online platforms, was obtained from Altmetric.com. Statistical assessment included the McNemar test, the Mann-Whitney test, and the Pearson correlation.; Results; Mean and median traditional citation counts were 10.7 ± 15.4 and 5 vs 3.3 ± 13.3 and 0 for Altmetric. Among all articles, 96.4% had ≥1 traditional citation vs 41.8% for Altmetric (P < 0.001). Online platforms for which at least 5% of the articles were represented included Mendeley (42.8%), Twitter (34.2%), Facebook (10.7%), and news outlets (8.4%). Citations and Altmetric were weakly correlated (r = 0.20), with only a 25.0% overlap in terms of articles within their top 10th percentiles. Traditional citations were higher for articles with imaging vs nonimaging content (11.5 ± 16.2 vs 6.9 ± 9.8, P < 0.001), but Altmetric scores were higher in articles with nonimaging content (5.1 ± 11.1 vs 2.8 ± 13.7, P = 0.006).; Conclusions; Although overall online attention to radiology journal content was low, alternative metrics exhibited unique trends, particularly for nonclinical articles, and may provide a complementary measure of radiology research impact compared to traditional citation counts.",24,Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic/statistics & numerical data; Radiology; Social Media/statistics & numerical data,,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28256440 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633217300028 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633217300028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2016.11.019,0,28256440,10.1016/j.acra.2016.11.019,2594567742,,001-228-542-182-425; 006-905-980-624-227; 007-205-762-763-201; 008-417-185-917-514; 009-539-928-115-769; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-537-281-905-239; 011-210-804-078-212; 013-848-964-561-065; 018-439-684-800-564; 020-176-962-705-293; 020-568-876-058-301; 022-308-721-164-662; 044-710-729-191-829; 047-122-615-013-66X; 047-436-441-352-101; 050-252-270-491-60X; 061-147-129-669-776; 066-507-313-507-599; 076-868-616-615-243; 079-603-137-314-908; 086-156-506-506-799; 095-384-486-659-878; 096-831-840-976-402; 102-973-599-213-44X; 113-246-723-600-243; 114-569-399-530-919; 138-860-101-839-150; 144-004-555-469-786; 156-131-455-686-350,31

Neal Stewart,"One of the current mantras in research publishing is that science papers should ‘‘tell a story.’’ I have been known to utter this phrase to my own trainees in the form of a strong suggestion. Current wisdom states that telling a cogent story through a scientific publication is an important vehicle to render research findings understandable—not only to reviewers and primary readers of the papers, i.e., other scientists, but also to science writers and the public. After all, a paper with a novel finding that tells a good story can potentially get published in a journal with a high impact factor and will be cited at high frequency. And if these conventional research metrics are not enough to spur on the storytelling, we are now reminded of ‘‘altmetrics’’ (see http://altmetrics.org/manifesto) such as the number of posts on blogs, Facebook and popular media articles. Of course, one problem about telling a story is that stories, by their nature, are often fictional. Research journal articles fall into the genre of non-fiction. The temptation to embellish or ‘‘tell a tall tale,’’ ever-present in the quest of storytelling, cannot be tolerated in science papers. ‘‘A picture is worth a thousand words’’ goes the old saying. Historically, illustrations, graphs, micrographs and other types of figures in papers were used to show key data that would help the reader to understand the most important findings in a study. The same is true today, but in the digital age, molecular data in gels, blots and photographic images are easily manipulated with a few mouse swipes and keystrokes. In addition, raw data images included in older techniques, such as northern blot analysis has been replaced by real-time RT-PCR summary data. Papers published in Plant Cell Reports are typically awash with digital data and images, which should give us pause for a reality check. Back in the old analog days of Kodachrome and Polaroids, what you saw was truth—the raw data. The common adage, ‘‘typical results are shown’’ was usually interpreted as ‘‘best results are shown,’’ but at least the reader could assume that the results were real, and that they were, to some degree, represented by the image. Sadly, programs such as Photoshop render this assumption obsolete. Readers, reviewers and editors should be vigilant to assess if ‘‘typical results’’ are actual results at all. Fanelli’s (2009) meta-analysis of research misconduct surveys found that 1.97 % of scientists admitted to falsification or fabrication. More shocking is that scientists admitted that they had observed that 14.12 % of their colleagues had falsified research (Fanelli 2009). Estimates range as high as 20 % of cell biology papers containing a questionable figure (Pearson 2005). Rossner and Yamada (2004) have succinctly described guidelines about permissible image manipulation. There is no need to recapitulate the details of their discussion here—I encourage all scientists to read their paper. What is important as an overriding research integrity issue is that the images shown on the pages of Plant Cell Reports and other journals should reflect the true nature of the data and the experiments performed. For example, if a gel contained 12 lanes, then the best practice is to show the entire gel and only the gel in the panel—the unit of the study should be made clear to the reader. Therefore, images of separate gels should not be spliced together, and if lanes within a gel are removed in an image, it is best practice to state the image was manipulated. A photographic image of plant cells or tissues should be honestly representative. A key guideline is that Communicated by G.

It is therefore important to identify factors affecting citation scores that are unrelated to scholarly quality or usefulness so that these can be taken into account. Regression is the most powerful statistical technique to identify these factors and hence it is important to identify the best regression strategy for citation data. Citation counts tend to follow a discrete lognormal distribution and, in the absence of alternatives, have been investigated with negative binomial regression. Using simulated discrete lognormal data (continuous lognormal data rounded to the nearest integer) this article shows that a better strategy is to add one to the citations, take their log and then use the general linear (ordinary least squares) model for regression (e.g., multiple linear regression, ANOVA), or to use the generalised linear model without the log. Reasonable results can also be obtained if all the zero citations are discarded, the log is taken of the remaining citation counts and then the general linear model is used, or if the generalised linear model is used with the continuous lognormal distribution. Similar approaches are recommended for altmetric data, if it proves to be lognormally distributed.",8,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157714000923 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.08877 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.09.011 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1510.html#ThelwallW15 https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08877 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v8y2014i4p963-971.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:infome:v:8:y:2014:i:4:p:963-971 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157714000923,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2014.09.011,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2014.09.011,1999636793,,002-036-882-592-981; 004-174-630-436-112; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-011-849-467-618; 006-510-719-992-476; 008-812-618-060-828; 009-447-623-801-823; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-261-691-530-826; 012-177-931-846-389; 012-899-257-322-472; 014-979-435-493-155; 015-260-354-536-765; 015-270-923-005-163; 021-389-655-142-924; 021-887-557-089-930; 026-690-594-587-368; 027-705-670-883-165; 029-616-189-234-167; 034-145-218-792-807; 034-524-491-899-111; 041-350-376-172-845; 041-571-770-238-426; 041-877-563-529-281; 044-715-464-454-146; 050-886-092-294-893; 057-286-311-076-534; 058-914-133-640-307; 059-825-637-471-158; 061-118-588-828-227; 062-022-048-057-724; 066-507-313-507-599; 066-827-534-057-723; 073-474-712-890-703; 075-634-374-206-923; 076-587-545-462-807; 077-386-007-366-653; 081-058-141-126-601; 082-268-501-475-090; 083-994-574-833-752; 084-333-644-737-562; 087-802-624-733-386; 089-748-312-413-154; 100-436-172-024-424; 101-012-140-190-871; 101-339-252-656-116; 101-623-111-735-521; 101-756-965-887-093; 102-976-599-246-704; 103-199-876-285-449; 104-625-491-269-961; 106-122-324-984-536; 110-457-195-877-695; 110-998-638-822-098; 119-318-472-187-228; 121-233-659-612-342; 122-353-860-287-425; 122-969-686-802-991; 126-343-360-669-298; 131-567-656-195-670; 132-884-081-878-424; 138-959-000-285-718; 140-682-913-367-454; 140-750-789-105-933; 149-086-710-081-997; 167-353-967-596-669; 174-777-347-890-069,53

Who should I talk to at a conference? Which research group should get this grant? Researchers and funders alike must make daily judgments on how to best spend their limited time and money–judgments that are becoming increasingly difficult as the volume of scholarly communication increases. Not only does the number of scholarly papers continue to grow, it is joined by new forms of communication from data publications to microblog posts.; ; To deal with incoming information, scholars have always relied upon filters. At first these filters were manually compiled compendia and corpora of the literature. But by the mid-20th century, filters built on manual indexing began to break under the weight of booming postwar science production. Garfield [1] and others pioneered a solution: automated filters that leveraged scientists own impact judgments, aggregating citations as “pellets of peer recognition.” [2].; ; These citation-based filters have dramatically grown in importance and have become the tenet of how research impact is measured. But, like manual indexing 60 years ago, they may today be failing to keep up with the literature’s growing volume, velocity, and diversity [3].; ; Citations are heavily gamed [4]–[6] and are painfully slow to accumulate [7], and overlook increasingly important societal and clinical impacts [8]. Most importantly, they overlook new scholarly forms like datasets, software, and research blogs that fall outside of the scope of citable research objects. In sum, citations only reflect formal acknowledgment and thus they provide only a partial picture of the science system [9]. Scholars may discuss, annotate, recommend, refute, comment, read, and teach a new finding before it ever appears in the formal citation registry. We need new mechanisms to create a subtler, higher-resolution picture of the science system.; ; The Quest for Better Filters; The scientometrics community has not been blind to the limitations of citation measures, and has collectively proposed methods to gather evidence of broader impacts and provide more detail about the science system: tracking acknowledgements [10], patents [11], mentorships [12], news articles [8], usage in syllabuses [13], and many others, separately and in various combinations [14]. The emergence of the Web, a “nutrient-rich space for scholars” [15], has held particular promise for new filters and lenses on scholarly output. Webometrics researchers have uncovered evidence of informal impact by examining networks of hyperlinks and mentions on the broader Web [16]–[18]. An important strand of webometrics has also examined the properties of article download data [7], [19], [20].; ; The last several years, however, have presented a promising new approach to gathering fine-grained impact data: tracking large-scale activity around scholarly products in online tools and environments. These tools and environments include, among others:; ; ; social media like Twitter and Facebook; ; ; online reference managers like CiteULike, Zotero, and Mendeley; ; ; collaborative encyclopedias like Wikipedia; ; ; blogs, both scholarly and general-audience; ; ; scholarly social networks, like ResearchGate or Academia.edu; ; ; conference organization sites like Lanyrd.com; ; ; ; Growing numbers of scholars are using these and similar tools to mediate their interaction with the literature. In doing so, they are leaving valuable tracks behind them–tracks with potential to show informal paths of influence with unprecedented speed and resolution. Many of these tools offer open APIs, supporting large-scale, automated mining of online activities and conversations around research objects [21].; ; Altmetrics [22], [23] is the study and use of scholarly impact measures based on activity in online tools and environments. The term has also been used to describe the metrics themselves–one could propose in plural a “set of new altmetrics.” Altmetrics is in most cases a subset of both scientometrics and webometrics; it is a subset of the latter in that it focuses more narrowly on scholarly influence as measured in online tools and environments, rather than on the Web more generally.; ; Altmetrics may support finer-grained maps of science, broader and more equitable evaluations, and improvements to the peer-review system [24]. On the other hand, the use and development of altmetrics should be pursued with appropriate scientific caution. Altmetrics may face attempts at manipulation similar to what Google must deal with in web search ranking. Addressing such manipulation may, in-turn, impact the transparency of altmetrics. New and complex measures may distort our picture of the science system if not rigorously assessed and correctly understood. Finally, altmetrics may promote an evaluation system for scholarship that many argue has become overly focused on metrics.",7,Biomedical Research/trends; Humans; Internet; Publications; Social Media; Statistics as Topic,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012PLoSO...748753P https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3486795/ https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/the-altmetrics-collection http://nitens.org/docs/altmetrics_plos.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3486795 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048753 http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/48803/296608.pdf;sequence=1 https://core.ac.uk/display/91235567 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2Fc155d882-6880-4291-abe6-b2702e6d5e54,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048753,0,23133655,10.1371/journal.pone.0048753,2396414759,PMC3486795,000-073-326-255-503; 005-531-363-623-587; 006-006-008-068-460; 016-574-404-432-904; 020-647-409-662-919; 024-307-868-854-842; 024-491-347-287-793; 025-168-980-982-659; 032-094-932-105-517; 032-858-825-665-444; 034-524-491-899-111; 052-548-921-979-744; 053-827-960-061-58X; 054-417-118-908-077; 067-704-690-865-884; 073-020-817-673-290; 073-290-673-375-365; 087-802-624-733-386; 094-880-924-920-295; 099-816-321-816-355; 113-557-566-001-586; 116-004-210-033-746; 123-687-398-098-005; 143-458-914-205-847; 167-689-186-031-509; 189-638-011-101-462,124

Murphy,"Aim Social media (SoMe) platforms have become leading methods of communication and dissemination of scientific information in the medical community. They allow for immediate discussion and widespread engagement around important topics. It has been hypothesized that the activity on Twitter positively correlates with highly cited articles. The purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence and activity of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals on Twitter, with the hypothesis that the impact factor is positively associated with the Twitter usage. Methods The top 50 Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals, ranked by 2016 Impact Factor were analyzed. The Twitter profiles of each journal or affiliated society were identified. Other SoMe platforms used were also recorded. The Twitonomy software (Digonomy Pty Ltd, New South Wales, Australia) was used to analyze the Twitter profiles over a one-year period. The Twitter Klout scores were recorded for each journal to approximate the SoMe influence. The Altmetric scores (the total number of mentions via alternative metrics) were also recorded. The statistical analysis was carried out to identify correlations between journal Impact Factors, SoMe activity, Twitter Klout scores and Altmetric scores.  Results Twenty-two journals (44%); changed to 'had dedicated Twitter profiles [corrected]. Fourteen journals (28%) were associated with societies that had profiles and 14 journals (28%) had no Twitter presence. The mean Impact Factor overall was 2.16 +/- 0.14 (range, 1.07-5.16). The journals with dedicated Twitter profiles had higher Impact Factors than those without (mean 2.41 vs. 1.61; P=0.005). A greater number of Twitter followers were associated with higher Impact Factors (R2 0.317, P=0.03). The journals with higher Twitter Klout scores had higher Impact Factors (R2 0.357, P=0.016). The Altmetric score was positively associated with an Impact Factor (R2 0.310, P=0.015). The journals with higher numbers of retweets (virtual citations in the Twittersphere) had higher Altmetric scores (R2 0.463, P=0.015). Conclusion The Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals with dedicated Twitter profiles have higher Impact Factors than those without. The Altmetrics is likely to play a significant role in the literature evaluation going forward along with the traditional metrics. The engagement with the Twitter by Trauma and Orthopaedic surgeons should be encouraged.",9,,,https://www.cureus.com/articles/10043-the-use-of-twitter-by-the-trauma-and-orthopaedic-surgery-journals-twitter-activity-impact-factor-and-alternative-metrics,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.1931,0,29464138,10.7759/cureus.1931,2774105302,,009-707-763-421-927; 028-800-911-277-740; 039-436-435-369-054; 042-543-402-213-055; 049-902-212-921-284; 050-252-270-491-60X; 059-677-019-059-324; 070-165-651-115-034; 073-777-167-119-224; 079-603-137-314-908; 086-156-506-506-799; 097-179-911-288-087; 112-640-353-590-20X,2

The analysis of mobile performances draws attention to how travellers incorporate valued dispersed practices into mobility. We argue that incorporating such contingent practices into travel generates affective satisfactions consistently sought across transport mode changes through the life-course. These findings complement existing abstract analyses of modal choice and are explored to draw out the implications for the attractiveness of different modes and the potential for broader transitions to lower carbon mobility.,12,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17450101.2015.1096083 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/76461/ http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17450101.2015.1096083 https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17450101.2015.1096083 http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/services/downloadRegister/102961906/Satisfying_everday_mobility_final_typset.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17450101.2015.1096083 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2760042_code546230.pdf?abstractid=2760042&mirid=1 https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/rmobxx/v12y2017i1p97-115.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42415451.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2015.1096083,0,,10.1080/17450101.2015.1096083,1898914143,,000-580-087-969-360; 000-736-770-430-181; 001-595-149-979-993; 007-461-396-227-259; 009-106-969-240-167; 010-662-795-589-141; 010-877-051-079-323; 014-547-205-451-161; 018-318-849-186-101; 022-098-568-012-597; 022-868-185-851-375; 027-041-920-199-720; 027-558-039-628-675; 030-963-202-453-869; 036-452-857-625-397; 039-879-215-784-355; 040-064-106-607-438; 043-020-010-457-345; 043-902-360-839-647; 044-340-410-237-498; 044-629-997-047-307; 046-496-753-981-095; 049-345-793-210-149; 050-834-614-427-207; 055-556-576-215-733; 058-862-541-098-359; 058-932-818-510-475; 059-816-855-712-736; 067-899-497-673-525; 071-479-570-064-018; 076-968-509-738-959; 077-519-991-756-970; 078-756-778-058-60X; 080-444-438-735-239; 093-390-964-544-951; 094-096-685-185-078; 094-561-354-018-145; 098-175-599-653-964; 107-269-473-573-653; 110-190-929-363-803; 114-642-394-751-85X; 115-226-157-858-841; 115-394-632-269-089; 124-309-096-474-165; 136-912-457-311-823; 137-337-298-546-366; 139-422-590-078-570; 160-751-255-394-283; 172-441-424-317-441; 178-240-027-539-590; 178-591-544-207-898; 178-694-049-959-71X; 186-247-805-700-005; 195-796-227-230-686,19

These problems are addressed here by (a) a field normalisation formula, the Mean Normalised Log-transformed Citation Score (MNLCS) that allows simple confidence limits to be calculated and is similar to a proposal of Lundberg, (b) field normalisation formulae for the proportion of cited articles in a set, the Equalised Mean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (EMNPC) and the Mean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (MNPC), to deal with mostly uncited data sets, (c) a sampling strategy to minimise data collection costs, and (d) free unified software to gather the raw data, implement the sampling strategy, and calculate the indicator formulae and confidence limits. The approach is demonstrated (but not fully tested) by comparing the Scopus citations, Mendeley readers and Wikipedia mentions of research funded by Wellcome, NIH, and MRC in three large fields for 2013–2016. Within the results, statistically significant differences in both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts were found even for sets of articles that were less than six months old. Mendeley reader counts were more precise than Scopus citations for the most recent articles and all three funders could be demonstrated to have an impact in Wikipedia that was significantly above the world average.",11,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2016.12.002 https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01431 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1612.html#Thelwall16f https://core.ac.uk/display/77612810 http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01431.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S175115771630205X https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v11y2017i1p128-151.html http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175115771630205X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2016.12.002,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2016.12.002,2560495985,,005-893-127-733-440; 006-353-909-183-550; 006-369-072-945-600; 006-631-087-897-77X; 009-865-709-406-084; 009-971-817-581-962; 010-057-293-861-47X; 011-090-092-394-028; 012-418-402-952-615; 012-899-257-322-472; 013-024-073-299-954; 013-525-736-972-288; 016-715-045-833-488; 017-663-895-918-458; 019-646-469-043-757; 019-658-209-137-261; 023-271-041-203-090; 026-391-452-599-662; 026-576-630-650-24X; 026-887-181-999-718; 030-618-222-754-098; 032-858-825-665-444; 037-306-820-743-518; 039-570-453-739-175; 040-865-650-803-539; 042-120-011-270-12X; 045-538-349-555-146; 047-436-441-352-101; 050-252-270-491-60X; 054-016-914-748-353; 055-808-236-401-052; 056-790-947-087-593; 059-382-803-887-045; 064-420-766-656-39X; 064-807-261-800-84X; 066-058-608-660-901; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-466-193-509-888; 068-417-475-849-819; 072-219-219-275-120; 076-399-144-464-512; 081-564-516-227-727; 084-130-857-238-345; 085-235-279-508-864; 090-725-434-229-13X; 090-958-442-251-078; 106-598-824-898-46X; 109-857-753-937-128; 111-294-779-118-265; 115-885-068-380-769; 120-155-307-250-272; 121-011-195-507-937; 127-574-794-111-894; 128-310-239-321-46X; 145-300-817-746-37X; 146-375-270-270-445; 149-086-710-081-997; 160-606-043-902-329; 169-451-869-031-762,41

Differences between services were analyzed regarding the number of documents with an altmetric event and the counting differences in each metric. Results show that Altmetric.com is the provider with the best coverage of blog posts, news and tweets; while PlumX better collects Mendeley readers; and CED is the site that extracts more Wikipedia citations.

Fernández-Guerrero,"This paper proposes a multivariate model for the evaluation of international emergency medicine journals using the most widely used, efficient and representative productivity and citation indicators. This is a descriptive observational evaluation study based on a sample of 24 journals included in the emergency medicine category of the Journal Citation Reports 2015. The sample is evaluated based on seven evaluation indicators: Journal Citation Reports impact factor, three H-indices (Web of Science, Scimago and Google Scholar), the Scimago Journal Rank and two altmetric scores (3-month and any time). The bivariate correlations between the diverse distributions of evaluation indicators and a multivariate metric reliability index are calculated. The factorial structure of the indicators is explored and clusters of journals are defined. A factor score is assigned to each journal. The correlations between the seven evaluation indicators are high and statistically significant. The metric reliability of the multivariate analysis calculated using Cronbach's alpha is .97. A general factor explains the 84.64% variance of the factor space of the seven evaluation indicators, representing the `quality of EM journals' construct.

Nocera; Carter Boyd; Hunter Boudreau; Ornin Hakim; Soroush Rais-Bahrami,"Abstract Objectives To determine if article Altmetric scores correlate with journal impact factor and citation count in the urologic literature. Methods We identified the top 10 most-cited articles for the 15 urology journals with the highest impact factor in 2013 and 2016. Citation count and Altmetric scores were recorded for each of the articles. The journal impact factor and date of Twitter account development was recorded for each of the journals. The variables were analyzed in Microsoft excel using Pearson's correlation testing. Results A total of 300 articles were analyzed. In 2013, Altmetric scores and citation number showed a significant positive correlation (r=0.164, p=0.045), although Altmetric scores did not correlate with journal impact factor (r=0.005, p=0.957). In 2016, there was significant positive correlation between Altmetric scores and citation number (r=0.268, p=0.0009), as well as between Altmetric scores and journal impact factor (r=0.201, p=0.014). The total citation count decreased from 15,235 in 2013 to 8,622 in 2016 while the total Altmetric score increased from 1,135 in 2013 to 2,563 in 2016. Older Twitter accounts were not associated with increasing correlations between Altmetric score and bibliometrics in either 2013 (r=0.221, p=0.54) or 2016 (r=0.083, p=0.819). Conclusions At this point in time, Altmetric score is only weakly correlated with citation counts in the urology literature. Altmetrics and traditional bibliometrics should be viewed as complements to one another rather than surrogates when determining research dissemination and impact.",134,Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research/methods; Humans; Information Dissemination; Journal Impact Factor; Knowledge Discovery/methods; Research Design; Urology/education,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429519308271,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2019.09.014,0,31560915,10.1016/j.urology.2019.09.014,2976165032,,010-168-316-482-221; 017-509-413-804-883; 017-573-578-561-783; 050-744-930-738-219; 055-070-550-438-664; 056-672-835-542-654; 070-165-651-115-034; 092-132-106-998-377; 161-675-443-181-79X,1

But despite data that confirm this trend, little is known about the reasons why researchers decide to publish their results in English rather than in their first language. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of researchers' scientific domain on their motivation to publish in English. The results are based on a large-scale survey of Spanish postdoctoral researchers at four different universities and one research centre, and reflect responses from 1717 researchers about their difficulties, motivations, attitudes and publication strategies. Researchers' publication experiences as corresponding authors of articles in English and in their first language are strongly related to their scientific domain. But surprisingly, Spanish researchers across all domains expressed a similar degree of motivation when they write research articles in English. They perceive a strong association between this language and the desire for their research to be recognized and rewarded. Our study also shows that the target scientific audience is a key factor in understanding the choice of publication language. The implications of our findings go beyond the field of linguistics and are relevant to studies of scientific productivity and visibility, the quality and impact of research, and research assessment policies.",103,,,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2780190 https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/114333 http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/114333/1/research_articles_english_Lopez.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-015-1570-1 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-015-1570-1 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-015-1570-1 https://core.ac.uk/display/36194199 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v103y2015i3d10.1007_s11192-015-1570-1.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-015-1570-1,0,,10.1007/s11192-015-1570-1,2082693767,,000-544-582-214-661; 001-021-998-282-274; 001-371-649-825-509; 003-547-268-579-681; 005-191-462-824-984; 005-650-400-596-170; 006-253-984-486-916; 006-326-322-190-539; 009-399-099-014-896; 010-376-175-836-706; 011-576-468-921-421; 012-182-221-273-746; 012-265-077-038-47X; 013-189-671-689-405; 013-776-860-929-910; 013-910-808-379-004; 014-463-404-876-033; 016-052-639-798-54X; 017-905-677-671-476; 022-868-669-159-369; 024-202-318-858-098; 025-101-367-630-579; 026-666-320-280-73X; 027-480-252-289-61X; 027-878-089-184-964; 028-759-626-375-446; 029-205-008-439-117; 029-257-417-288-684; 029-329-815-015-104; 030-477-506-738-130; 034-413-208-155-343; 034-766-850-004-837; 037-182-110-606-98X; 038-385-185-415-957; 042-242-783-762-541; 042-652-624-741-737; 042-902-610-574-252; 044-017-877-767-214; 044-848-687-559-104; 046-841-674-135-16X; 047-563-298-370-762; 048-638-333-300-39X; 051-463-119-090-703; 051-795-669-613-581; 052-398-976-983-563; 053-583-669-880-813; 056-695-711-120-726; 059-491-586-401-805; 060-561-472-174-508; 060-986-147-069-070; 061-202-463-100-664; 062-637-514-391-537; 064-223-704-792-22X; 066-561-774-448-410; 068-949-961-750-950; 069-422-902-387-130; 070-940-970-541-983; 071-963-909-936-642; 072-452-082-743-624; 072-513-787-964-925; 072-838-133-554-260; 072-841-750-339-256; 076-490-994-797-767; 077-942-503-239-156; 078-269-094-330-66X; 078-672-567-395-800; 079-383-428-344-988; 082-154-253-606-622; 083-554-941-327-968; 084-575-405-339-761; 085-534-936-677-802; 088-630-755-010-24X; 090-178-647-419-21X; 091-004-224-390-933; 093-624-756-887-932; 094-274-744-819-51X; 094-436-566-633-139; 094-531-558-055-813; 095-346-893-995-417; 095-677-320-843-519; 095-963-754-411-403; 097-134-104-546-386; 098-234-435-889-919; 099-740-342-617-082; 100-804-568-817-312; 101-778-756-709-554; 102-287-469-729-00X; 104-052-328-884-889; 104-285-529-755-546; 108-395-710-868-513; 108-579-105-972-546; 111-155-684-575-615; 112-568-686-660-444; 114-655-653-335-045; 115-013-609-634-330; 117-147-747-941-108; 120-029-957-660-268; 120-737-998-536-842; 126-061-970-631-734; 129-995-596-021-044; 130-704-786-040-628; 140-019-448-178-648; 141-494-824-021-118; 148-368-714-499-118; 148-942-540-873-264; 153-007-582-806-602; 158-529-538-557-127; 164-244-226-503-11X; 172-344-688-237-651; 175-423-159-751-801; 175-679-496-259-913; 177-079-677-744-428; 177-195-046-187-619; 181-669-298-452-972; 183-370-421-197-222; 185-416-159-498-727; 197-307-872-013-134; 198-625-273-004-48X,28

Among this ecosystem of heterogeneous indicators, social reference managers have been proposed as indicators of broader use of scholarly work. However, little work has been done to understand the data underlying this indicator. The present work uses a large-scale survey to study the users of two prominent social reference managers—Mendeley and Zotero. The survey examines demographic characteristics, usage of the platforms, as well as attitudes towards key issues in scholarly communication, such as open access, peer review, privacy, and the reward system of science. Results show strong differences between platforms: Mendeley users are younger and more gender-balanced; Zotero users are more engaged in social media and more likely to come from the social sciences and humanities. Zotero users are more likely to use the platform’s search functions and to organize their libraries, while Mendeley users are more likely to take advantage of some of the discovery and networking features—such as browsing papers and groups and connecting with other users. We discuss the implications of using metrics derived from these platforms as impact indicators.",13,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bibliometrics; Demography/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Interdisciplinary Communication; Middle Aged; Peer Review, Research/methods; Social Media/statistics & numerical data; Social Networking; Surveys and Questionnaires",,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198033 https://scinapse.io/papers/2864151529 https://www.ost.uqam.ca/publications/social-reference-managers-and-their-users-a-survey-of-demographics-and-ideologies/ https://www.cirst.uqam.ca/publications/social-reference-managers-and-their-users-a-survey-of-demographics-and-ideologies/ https://paperity.org/p/117400628/social-reference-managers-and-their-users-a-survey-of-demographics-and-ideologies,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198033,0,29995889,10.1371/journal.pone.0198033,2864151529,,004-924-180-697-031; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-418-270-613-554; 015-700-245-441-595; 022-783-973-655-305; 028-945-443-615-303; 029-500-644-026-171; 040-252-626-797-747; 055-788-708-180-492; 066-058-608-660-901; 072-463-767-991-704; 079-343-312-870-007; 086-809-706-245-39X; 087-802-624-733-386; 121-011-195-507-937; 122-073-156-920-876; 141-134-741-084-026; 146-046-930-226-363; 185-037-913-518-41X; 189-638-011-101-462,3

The popular social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin and social bookmarks such as Mendeley and CiteULike are nowadays widely used for communicating research to larger transnational audiences. In 2012, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment got signed by the scientific and researchers communities across the world. This declaration has given preference to the ALM or altmetrics over traditional but faulty journal impact factor (JIF)-based assessment of career scientists. JIF does not consider impact or influence beyond citations count as this count reflected only through Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database. Furthermore, JIF provides indicator related to the journal, but not related to a published paper. Thus, altmetrics now becomes an alternative metrics for performance assessment of individual scientists and their contributed scholarly publications. This paper provides a glimpse of genesis of altmetrics in measuring efficacy of scholarly communications and highlights available altmetric tools and social platforms linking altmetric tools, which are widely used in deriving altmetric scores of scholarly publications. The paper thus argues for institutions and policy makers to pay more attention to altmetrics based indicators for evaluation purpose but cautions that proper safeguards and validations are needed before their adoption.",3,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2499467 http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.0090.pdf http://eprints.rclis.org/24190/ https://core.ac.uk/display/33185834 https://www.jscires.org/article/80 http://eprints.rclis.org/24190/7/JSciRes_2014_3_2_82_145622.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1408.0090D/abstract http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1408.html#DasM14,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2499467,0,,10.2139/ssrn.2499467,2119237768,,004-924-180-697-031; 009-870-224-664-647; 015-270-923-005-163; 019-007-990-305-286; 028-903-505-800-665; 030-099-848-668-595; 035-964-848-340-165; 040-666-303-194-802; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-277-248-391-128; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-090-012-058-700; 066-507-313-507-599; 089-914-448-038-331; 110-457-195-877-695; 127-458-994-664-604; 133-688-589-484-897; 141-134-741-084-026; 172-253-610-299-656,16

The strength of correlation between the two end points varies, raising questions about the correlation between results of interim analyses that report mature progression-free survival data with the subsequent final publication that report overall survival.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""Methods"">We searched PubMed from 2005 to 2015 for randomized controlled trials that measured both progression-free survival and overall survival. We matched interim publications that reported mature progression-free survival data with their final analyses that reported overall survival. We included 25 matched pairs and 8 unmatched interim analyses whose final analyses are not published. Our primary objectives are to compare interim publications with matched final publications in terms of journal prominence and Altmetric score and to compare progression-free survival and overall survival effect sizes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""Results"">All interim analyses (n = 33) were prespecified and there was a statistically significant progression-free survival benefit in 31 (93.9%). Only eight matched final analyses had statistically significant overall survival data. Interim analyses were more often published in top-5 general medicine journals (P &lt; 0.01) but not in top-5 oncology journals (P = 0.26). Altmetric scores were higher in interim analyses (P &lt; 0.01). Progression-free survival effect sizes from interim analyses were a median of 31% larger than overall survival effect sizes from final analyses.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"">Interim analyses with progression-free survival data may generate hype in oncology, as evidenced by journal impact factors and Altmetric scores. The cause of this hype may be due, in part, to large progression-free survival effect sizes. Regardless, in trials that investigate progression-free and overall survival, publishing interim analyses with mature progression-free survival data apart from the final analyses with mature overall survival should be cautioned.</AbstractText>",29,"Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use; Data Analysis; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Medical Oncology/methods; Neoplasms/drug therapy; Progression-Free Survival; Publication Bias; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/methods",Antineoplastic Agents,https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/29/12/2384/5126826 https://scholars.okstate.edu/en/publications/a-comparison-of-matched-interim-analysis-publications-and-final-a,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdy447,0,30307531,10.1093/annonc/mdy447,2897857139,,001-122-358-645-252; 003-714-659-266-813; 007-700-323-975-788; 008-992-883-100-457; 012-449-374-764-247; 014-864-175-183-15X; 015-534-870-345-127; 024-044-208-741-007; 024-158-591-896-129; 029-790-108-692-750; 032-194-239-961-348; 033-634-913-207-367; 042-188-415-703-746; 047-338-243-660-42X; 054-652-353-634-635; 056-208-530-751-261; 057-787-619-604-829; 058-870-470-456-373; 059-570-447-617-564; 067-192-279-737-819; 071-974-026-663-592; 072-348-477-591-039; 072-928-147-382-526; 081-135-412-754-105; 081-324-564-726-210; 082-040-379-552-222; 090-687-617-355-679; 094-020-286-939-556; 101-138-987-926-104; 153-768-003-037-72X,2

A random sample of 300 social sciences blog posts (out of 1,233 blog posts) from ResearchBlogging.org published between 01/01/2012 to 18/06/2014 were subjected to content analysis. The 300 blog posts had 472 references including 424 journal articles from 269 different journals. Sixty?one (22.68%) of all cited journals were from the social sciences and most of the journals with high frequency were highly cited general science journals such as PNAS and Science. Seventy?five percent of all journals were referenced only once. The average age of articles cited at the time of citation was 5.8 years. Discussion and criticism were the two main categories of motivations. Overall, the study shows the potential of blog citations as an altmetric measure and as a proxy for assessing the research impact. A considerable number of citation motivations in blogs such as disputing a belief, suggesting policies, providing a solution to a problem, reacting to media, criticism and the like seemed to support gaining societal benefits. Societal benefits are considered as helping stimulate new approaches to social issues, or informing public debate and policymaking. Lower self?citation (compared to some other altmetric measures such as tweets) and the fact that blogging involves generating content (i.e. an intellectual process) give them an advantage for altmetrics. However, limitations and contextual issues such as disciplinary differences and low uptake of altmetrics, in general, in scholarly communication should not be ignored when using blogs as a data source for altmetrics.",5,,,http://journals.sfu.ca/ijkcdt/index.php/ijkcdt/article/view/55/0 https://doaj.org/article/4c2e63b575aa403790bc7dc03b7a3b93 http://ijkcdt.net/xml/04191/04191.pdf http://koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=JSKTBN_2015_v5n1_15 https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/blog-citations-as-indicators-of-the-societal-impact-of-research-c,http://dx.doi.org/10.5865/ijkct.2015.5.1.015,0,,10.5865/ijkct.2015.5.1.015,1874013868,,003-075-869-802-612; 010-994-654-572-89X; 011-044-076-432-98X; 015-905-943-451-220; 019-457-587-825-722; 021-120-673-715-990; 025-863-077-950-778; 029-186-189-428-511; 035-181-820-222-262; 036-550-428-112-373; 040-452-112-976-920; 041-041-497-873-964; 043-807-526-841-216; 050-252-270-491-60X; 052-645-971-034-989; 062-049-790-149-754; 064-509-241-094-364; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-233-797-069-177; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-588-203-167-902; 091-819-616-441-856; 100-487-663-161-589; 105-408-446-496-845; 115-363-416-442-973; 117-109-843-318-28X; 122-353-860-287-425; 127-458-994-664-604; 139-651-430-124-012; 155-841-325-091-746; 182-217-337-748-856; 195-973-743-191-913,3

The factors include journal impact factor, individual collaboration, international collaboration, institution prestige, country prestige, research funding, abstract readability, abstract length, title length, number of cited references, field size, and field type and will be modeled in association with citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter posts, Facebook posts, blog posts, and news posts. The results demonstrate that eight factors are important for increased citation counts, seven different factors are important for increased Mendeley readers, eight factors are important for increased Twitter posts, three factors are important for increased Facebook posts, six factors are important for increased blog posts, and five factors are important for increased news posts. Journal impact factor and international collaboration are the two factors that significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all altmetric scores. Moreover, it seems that the factors driving Mendeley readership are similar to those driving citation counts. However, the altmetric events differ from each other in terms of a small number of factors; for instance, institution prestige and country prestige associate with increased Mendeley readers and blog and news posts, but it is an insignificant factor for Twitter and Facebook posts. The findings contribute to the continued development of theoretical models and methodological developments associated with capturing, interpreting, and understanding altmetric events.",69,,,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.23934 https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23934 https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23934 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23934 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jinfst/v69y2018i6p832-843.html http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1710.html#abs-1710-08594,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23934,0,,10.1002/asi.23934,2964302217,,005-293-195-870-376; 009-538-546-892-402; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-678-131-572-140; 014-069-410-581-703; 014-979-435-493-155; 017-366-390-008-140; 023-271-041-203-090; 027-591-182-413-436; 029-054-339-138-305; 030-937-641-641-686; 031-524-411-044-246; 034-122-607-155-359; 038-212-076-923-252; 039-505-270-645-642; 044-794-989-497-868; 048-113-874-367-632; 048-588-324-214-737; 050-886-092-294-893; 061-118-588-828-227; 061-451-759-153-519; 073-420-511-868-290; 084-571-982-315-26X; 092-719-593-168-401; 102-976-599-246-704; 105-402-220-957-576; 105-402-655-977-461; 112-388-610-249-693; 121-011-195-507-937; 132-884-081-878-424; 136-315-909-867-529; 137-757-402-129-222; 140-225-161-120-702; 140-682-913-367-454; 146-627-172-765-75X,9

In this study, we deal with a relatively new form of societal impact measurements. Recently, Altmetric--a start-up providing publication level metrics--started to make data for publications available which have been mentioned in policy documents. We regard this data source as an interesting possibility to specifically measure the (societal) impact of research. Using a comprehensive dataset with publications on climate change as an example, we study the usefulness of the new data source for impact measurement. Only 1.2 % (n = 2341) out of 191,276 publications on climate change in the dataset have at least one policy mention. We further reveal that papers published in Nature and Science as well as from the areas ""Earth and related environmental sciences"" and ""Social and economic geography"" are especially relevant in the policy context. Given the low coverage of the climate change literature in policy documents, this study can be only a first attempt to study this new source of altmetrics data. Further empirical studies are necessary, because mentions in policy documents are of special interest in the use of altmetrics data for measuring target-oriented the broader impact of research.",109,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124030/ https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07960 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v109y2016i3d10.1007_s11192-016-2115-y.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:scient:v:109:y:2016:i:3:d:10.1007_s11192-016-2115-y https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2115-y https://au.arxiv.org/abs/1608.07960 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07960 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3023214 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2115-y https://core.ac.uk/display/81731423 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1608.07960 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81731423.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2115-y,0,27942080,10.1007/s11192-016-2115-y,2512078133,PMC5124030,000-105-697-060-928; 001-463-948-594-614; 001-828-909-480-971; 002-539-370-032-23X; 003-075-869-802-612; 003-677-197-666-264; 004-174-630-436-112; 007-781-992-937-68X; 014-698-047-565-785; 014-701-472-060-424; 017-663-895-918-458; 020-750-501-347-722; 020-796-783-622-748; 022-515-648-947-688; 024-926-411-002-255; 027-023-910-772-280; 027-069-381-301-208; 029-629-734-884-935; 032-011-234-334-455; 035-623-238-122-325; 035-896-222-831-657; 036-343-347-929-742; 036-611-340-423-894; 037-203-075-090-390; 037-331-683-577-73X; 044-199-681-438-689; 044-710-793-309-959; 048-829-798-606-905; 048-848-146-953-411; 049-416-575-390-503; 052-170-297-569-773; 052-349-546-463-778; 053-353-326-000-307; 056-202-609-453-649; 056-630-494-000-471; 056-993-526-970-492; 057-835-091-125-590; 059-327-640-550-277; 060-677-560-181-278; 061-575-716-156-028; 062-900-501-797-218; 070-205-640-110-995; 071-092-418-193-978; 073-608-077-379-068; 082-262-253-315-866; 083-771-679-560-342; 090-451-223-096-175; 090-738-237-848-225; 091-569-838-533-140; 095-699-839-731-115; 105-402-220-957-576; 113-141-595-869-65X; 114-048-521-877-462; 116-740-542-041-991; 119-099-003-198-250; 122-785-641-454-819; 123-438-398-741-403; 130-446-333-613-121; 132-451-047-472-064; 150-070-576-398-617; 152-770-287-491-671; 156-811-948-363-663; 156-904-716-291-384; 157-923-036-867-482; 160-844-595-555-453; 167-324-413-842-28X; 169-068-496-045-683; 171-753-998-225-016; 174-344-213-043-354; 179-607-400-922-067; 182-664-972-508-370; 199-318-059-278-195,23

In the face of an increasing policy demand for quantitative methodologies to assess societal impact, social media data (altmetrics) has been presented as a potential method to capture broader forms of impact. However, current altmetric indicators were extrapolated from traditional citation approaches and are seen as problematic for assessing societal impact. In contrast, established qualitative methodologies for societal impact assessment are based on interaction approaches. These argue that assessment should focus on mapping the contexts in which engagement among researchers and stakeholders take place, as a means to understand the pathways to societal impact. Following these approaches, we propose to shift the use of altmetric data towards network analysis of researchers and stakeholders. We carry out two case studies, analysing researchers' networks with Twitter data. The comparison illustrates the potential of Twitter networks to capture disparate degrees of policy engagement. We propose that this mapping method can be used as an input within broader methodologies in case studies of societal impact assessment.",45,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00153v2 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00153 https://128.84.21.199/abs/1606.00153?context=cs,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scy024,0,,10.1093/scipol/scy024,2961913392,,002-052-422-936-00X; 002-666-995-736-984; 003-330-836-348-789; 004-346-570-375-36X; 006-716-004-619-110; 007-165-113-803-054; 010-896-842-870-916; 012-102-758-467-687; 012-717-760-048-191; 013-610-387-851-125; 015-399-424-215-446; 017-034-255-311-250; 020-449-358-487-577; 021-517-180-045-605; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-052-027-802-221; 026-910-841-011-238; 030-289-302-999-410; 030-768-812-630-339; 031-364-675-174-212; 039-629-638-522-857; 039-672-634-849-741; 047-355-729-266-494; 048-848-146-953-411; 051-471-653-993-486; 051-965-959-247-371; 055-430-689-149-505; 055-626-235-260-596; 058-190-489-485-247; 065-091-202-739-116; 074-340-089-585-442; 079-383-428-344-988; 081-059-795-171-326; 084-374-719-159-703; 100-444-109-139-616; 101-319-089-660-626; 104-911-890-370-132; 114-569-399-530-919; 120-031-301-873-562; 130-446-333-613-121; 138-260-595-328-561; 141-212-834-542-277; 149-285-034-553-961; 180-258-481-741-34X,13

Courtney; Maureen Rice,"Introduction The quality of clinical practice guidelines (PGs) has not been evaluated in child and youth mental health (CYMH). To address this gap, we will: (1) conduct a systematic review (SR) to answer the question ‘among eligible PGs relevant to the prevention or treatment of CYMH conditions, which PGs meet criteria for minimum and high quality?’; (2) apply nominal group methods to create recommendations for how CYMH PG quality, completeness and usefulness can be strengthened. Methods and analysis SR: Potentially eligible PGs will be identified in 12 databases using a reproducible search strategy developed by a research librarian. Trained raters will: (1) apply prespecified criteria to identify eligible PGs relevant to depression, anxiety, suicidality, bipolar disorder, behaviour disorder (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder) and substance use disorder; (2) extract descriptive data and (3) assess PG quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool. Scores on three AGREE II domains (rigour of development, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence) will designate PGs as minimum (≥50%) or high quality (≥70%). Nominal group: Four CYMH PG knowledge user groups (clinicians, mental health service planners, youth and adult family members) will participate in structured exercises derived using nominal group methods to generate recommendations to improve PG quality, completeness and usefulness. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required. Study products will be disseminated as follows. A cross-platform website will house eligible CYMH PGs and their quality ratings. Twitter and Facebook tools will promote it to a wide variety of PG users. Data from Google Analytics, Twitonomy and Altmetrics will inform usage evaluation. Complementary educational workshops will be conducted for CYMH professionals. Print materials and journal articles will be produced.

We assess the concern degree of social users on the Nature articles through the coverage analysis of Twitter and Facebook by publication year and discipline. The social media impact of a Nature article is examined by evaluating the mention rates on Twitter and on Facebook. Moreover, the correlation between tweets and citations is analyzed by publication year, discipline and Twitter user type to explore factors affecting the correlation. The results show that Twitter users have a higher concern degree on Nature articles than Facebook users, and Nature articles have higher and faster-growing impact on Twitter than on Facebook. The results also show that tweets and citations are somewhat related, and they mostly measure different types of impact. In addition, the correlation between tweets and citations highly depends on publication year, discipline and Twitter user type.",11,"Genomics; Humans; Natural Science Disciplines; Peer Review, Research; Social Media; Synthetic Biology",,https://paperity.org/p/80278816/bibliographic-analysis-of-nature-based-on-twitter-and-facebook-altmetrics-data https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132397/ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165997,0,27906981,10.1371/journal.pone.0165997,2557517619,PMC5132397,005-013-828-257-637; 013-331-505-668-726; 015-270-923-005-163; 021-696-172-742-263; 024-016-063-955-355; 025-152-214-736-241; 026-365-650-771-727; 028-579-304-744-829; 035-964-848-340-165; 040-452-112-976-920; 042-960-490-465-267; 050-252-270-491-60X; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-222-532-022-222; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-715-519-706-692; 072-219-219-275-120; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-267-966-095-209; 080-449-711-610-561; 095-061-118-952-572; 102-276-478-923-871; 122-073-156-920-876; 126-062-861-008-278; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 138-072-668-440-274; 179-223-065-594-04X,30

Today publications and citations in peer-reviewed journals are considered as indicators of scientific productivity and impact and used and misused in research evaluation. As scholarly communication is becoming more open and diverse and manuscripts, data, presentations and code are shared online, the altmetrics and open science movement demand the adaption of evaluation practices.

Such indicators have been termed altmetrics, influmetrics, social media metrics, or a type of webometric, and have recently been commercialised by a number of companies and employed by some publishers and university administrators. The social media metrics analysed here derive mainly from Twitter , Facebook , Google+ , F1000 , Mendeley , ResearchGate , and Academia.edu . They have the apparent potential to deliver fast, free indicators of the wider societal impact of research, or of different types of academic impacts, complementing academic impact indicators from traditional citation indexes. Although it is unwise to employ them in formal evaluations with stakeholders, due to their susceptibility to gaming and lack of real evidence that they reflect wider research impacts, they are useful for formative evaluations and to investigate science itself.

Presenter - Susanne Mikki. Purpose Based on the scholarly output in Norway, we aim to determine the total amount of articles freely available online, and prove whether there exists a citation advantage for these. We also investigate whether these articles receive more mentions on social platforms such as tweets or blogposts. Design The total scholarly publication output of Norway is indexed in CERES, the Current Information System in Norway. Based on these publication data, we searched a) Google Scholar and denoted a document as freely available, when a link to a full-text was provided, and b) altmetric.com to detect mentions of these articles. We analyzed the extracted data by publishing year, citations, availability, provider and mentions on different platforms. Findings Dependent on subject field, we find that almost 70 % of all articles are freely available. Articles behind paywalls belong to the most prestigious publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, Routledge and Universitetsforlaget (the main Norwegian academic publisher). According to Google Scholar’s link resolver, ResearchGate and academia.edu are the most frequent providers. In addition, institutional repositories seem to play a major role in posting free article versions. We find a clear advantage for open publishing; on average, these documents received almost 30 % more mentions on social media platforms and twice as many citations, indicating that open access is the future in publishing.",,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/149345574 http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/SCS/article/view/4251/0,http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/5.4251,0,,10.7557/5.4251,2768006682,,,0

The analysis is based on 1.2 million Web of Science indexed publications published in 2012. The disciplinary differences in the reading (saving) patterns of different types of Mendeley users are identified and depicted using VOSviewer overlay visualizations. The findings show that compared to other fields, publications from Mathematics & Computer Science have the lowest coverage in Mendeley. Publications from the Social Sciences & Humanities receive on average the highest number of readers in Mendeley. The highest uptake of Mendeley is by students, but this differs across fields. Professors, students, and librarians are mainly active in the Social Sciences & Humanities, a field of science with a relatively low citation density in Web of Science. In contrast, researchers and other professionals are mainly active in fields with a relatively high citation density such as the Biomedical & Health Sciences and the Life & Earth Sciences. In addition, it seems that researchers and professionals are relatively more interested in practical, methodological, and technical oriented topics while professors and students are attracted by the more educational and theoretical oriented topics. These different usage patterns among user types possibly reflect the way in which scholarly publications are used for scientific, educational, or other professional purposes.

Skandarajah; Peter Gibbs; Ian P. Hayes,"Importance Clinical colorectal cancer registries (CCCRs) are potentially powerful tools in colorectal cancer research. They are resource intensive, but to our knowledge, no formal review of their value exists. While quality control, clinical audit, and benchmarking are important factors in assessing the value of maintaining CCCRs, they are difficult to quantify. This study focuses on registry research output as a measure of value; the study hypothesizes that CCCRs do not produce sufficient published research output of clinical significance to justify the resources required to maintain them. Objective To assess the value of maintaining CCCRs by identifying and characterizing existing CCCRs and measuring their comparative research impact. Evidence Review We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) and Google Scholar for articles published from January 1990 to July 2016 that identified multi-institutional CCCRs with peer-reviewed published outcomes. Purely population-based registries were excluded. We then searched the same databases in the same time period for articles that were published by each included CCCR. The articles must have been based on outcomes relating to individual CCCR data. We categorized published outcomes into oncological, surgical, or other outcomes. We measured the research impact of each CCCR using the number of articles, citation index, impact factor, and Altmetric score. Findings A total of 18 CCCRs were identified, with sample sizes between 104 and 1 400 000 cases. Data fields, published aims, and outcomes were similar between registries. The most frequently published outcomes related to anastomotic leak following colorectal surgery. The National Cancer Database formed the basis of the highest number of publications (66), the Northern Region Colorectal Cancer Audit Group had the highest median article citation number (28.5), the National Bowel Cancer Audit had the highest median impact factor (4.72), and the National Cancer Database had the highest median Altmetric score (4.5). Conclusions and Relevance There is a significant body of colorectal cancer outcomes research generated from the CCCRs. However, given the enormous resources required, the overall research output and impact of CCCRs is low in proportion to the size of the data sets.

The datasets were compiled from four different sources: national reports on research output indicators in science fields, two statistics databases on higher education institutions open to the public, and e-journal usage statistics generated by 47 major publishers. Due to the different data sources utilized, a considerable number of missing values appeared in our datasets and various mapping issues required corrections prior to the analysis. Two techniques for handling missing data were applied and the impact of each technique was discussed. In order to compile the institutional data by field, journals were first mapped, and then the statistics were summarized according to subject field. We observed that e-journal use exhibited stronger correlations with the number of publications and the times cited, in contrast to the number of undergraduates, graduates, faculty members and the amount of research funds, and this was the case regardless of the NA handling method or author type. The difference between the maximum correlation for the amount of external research funding with two average indicators and that of the correlation for e-journal use were not significant. Statistically, the accountability of e-journal use for the average times cited per article and the average JIF was quite similar with external research funds. It was found that the number of e-journal articles used had a strong positive correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficients of r > 0.9, p < 0.05) with the number of articles published in SCI(E) journals and the times cited regardless of the author type, NA handling method or time period. We also observed that the top-five institutions in South Korea, with respect to the number of publications in SCI(E) journals, were generally across a balanced range of academic activities, while producing significant research output and using published material. Finally, we confirmed that the association of e-journal use with the two quantitative research indicators is strongly positive, even for the analyses by field, with the exception of the Arts and Humanities.",103,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-015-1563-0 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4430588 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430588/ https://core.ac.uk/display/81914645 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81914645.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-015-1563-0,0,25995527,10.1007/s11192-015-1563-0,2026990886,PMC4430588,001-654-600-518-823; 003-168-179-893-142; 005-699-111-606-288; 005-736-561-274-874; 010-401-028-248-64X; 018-356-097-469-13X; 020-647-409-662-919; 021-308-193-565-414; 030-443-945-463-372; 032-094-932-105-517; 044-939-394-642-346; 064-955-004-063-994; 073-429-995-460-902; 091-668-686-642-092; 092-537-320-495-223; 093-435-330-781-724; 107-452-141-732-721; 110-580-969-132-595; 112-498-785-118-959; 127-382-347-743-260; 133-003-481-039-201; 141-134-741-084-026; 152-988-229-115-477; 175-596-697-216-633,7

Other professional advancement systems worldwide, such as university hiring, contract renewals and government and foundation grantmaking processes similarly reinforce the primacy of toll access research formats. Hiring practices were of concern for our workgroup, given the increasing â€œadjunctificationâ€ and precarious state of tenured university posts in the United States. Due to these parallels, the Reform working group expanded our charge to consider hiring, grants, and other professional advancement scenarios common to researchersâ€™ concerns worldwide.In this report, we unpack how professional advancement practicesâ€”including and beyond promotion and tenure review standardsâ€”can be realigned to encourage researchersâ€™ adoption of open access (OA), open research, and open educational practices.Here, we set the scope of the current problem, discuss the reasons why professional advancement scenarios should be realigned to reward open research practices, identify challenges to reforming professional advancement scenarios wholesale and worldwide, recommend concrete actions for beginning the reformation process, and share resources related to professional advancement and open access.",1,,,https://journals.gmu.edu/osi/article/view/1928 https://journals.gmu.edu/osi/article/download/1928/1357,http://dx.doi.org/10.13021/g8osi.1.2017.1928,0,,10.13021/g8osi.1.2017.1928,2767306971,,,0

By utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, we studied the data using research techniques such as keyword categorization, co-word analysis and content analysis of user profile descriptions. Our results show that contrary to a random sample of Twitter users, users who tweet academic articles describe themselves more factually and by emphasizing their occupational expertise rather than personal interests.

We can also view them as representations of a causal structure, a logical process captured in a graph. From a causal perspective, we can ask questions such as whether authors form groups primarily due to their prior shared interest, or if their favourite topics are `contagious' and spread through co-authorship. Such networks have been widely studied by the artificial intelligence community, and recently a connection has been made to nonlocal correlations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics--the impact of latent hidden variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric methodology that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a causal graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a manifestation of prior shared interest only, leading to the observed patternedness. By introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we add a new tool to existing methods for the analysis of content-related social influences.",110,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v110y2017i2d10.1007_s11192-016-2194-9.html http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1062333 https://paperity.org/p/78389111/ruling-out-static-latent-homophily-in-citation-networks https://core.ac.uk/display/42731028 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3050363 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2194-9 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160508185W/abstract http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1605.html#WittekDN16 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-2194-9 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81202675.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-2194-9,0,28239206,10.1007/s11192-016-2194-9,2953229731; 2400990285; 2951039165,,002-052-422-936-00X; 005-280-037-873-878; 005-746-424-046-014; 011-364-541-838-073; 013-662-677-731-134; 017-118-694-295-772; 023-927-221-065-800; 029-373-804-401-972; 030-542-522-075-400; 034-098-436-427-040; 034-145-218-792-807; 034-390-631-473-294; 034-392-905-179-578; 035-917-843-464-255; 036-019-265-523-832; 038-212-076-923-252; 043-304-646-307-603; 045-682-442-524-519; 045-905-926-422-741; 047-846-759-571-293; 050-620-415-061-78X; 051-745-631-541-679; 054-818-565-070-154; 056-593-281-338-022; 057-286-311-076-534; 063-595-711-304-90X; 063-673-313-819-810; 066-161-410-219-681; 066-792-165-293-976; 069-229-345-420-430; 069-405-622-489-787; 071-756-045-198-301; 072-670-203-237-96X; 072-742-449-736-953; 092-972-476-916-991; 094-226-471-573-094; 095-258-654-450-233; 096-769-752-516-751; 098-234-435-889-919; 110-162-331-586-481; 113-557-566-001-586; 125-644-333-558-843; 130-016-003-181-362; 134-744-957-772-770; 140-750-789-105-933; 141-200-607-894-303; 144-716-891-197-447; 147-023-625-223-646; 151-478-490-108-469; 152-057-507-003-550; 160-844-595-555-453; 168-621-006-059-762; 182-664-972-508-370; 199-134-549-572-374,0

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the uptake of such services in order to decide which depositing strategies are effective and should be encouraged. Design/methodology/approach – This paper evaluates the views and shares of resources in the generic repository Figshare by subject category and resource type. Findings – Figshare use and common resource types vary substantially by subject category but resources can be highly viewed even in subjects with few members. More active subject areas do not tend to have more viewed or shared resources. Research limitations/implications – The view counts and share counts analysed may reflect author accesses or may be spammed. Practical implications – Limited uptake of Figshare within a subject area should not be a barrier to its use. Several highly successful innovative uses for Figshare show that it can reach beyond a purely academic audience.

This paper examines the presence of 77 Spanish universities in the two main scientific social networks ( ResearchGate and Academia.edu ). The results show that, despite the continuous development that those networks are having worldwide, the number of Spanish members in them is considered insufficient and in some universities is almost anecdotal. These results should be the starting point for an action program of the universities to increase the membership of their academic staff in those networks, as part of their mission of disseminating knowledge.",24,,,https://recyt.fecyt.es/index.php/EPI/article/view/epi.2015.sep.12 https://recyt.fecyt.es/index.php/EPI/article/download/epi.2015.sep.12/21888 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5216253 https://www.scipedia.com/public/Gonzalez-Diaz_et_al_2015a http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/49767 http://www.elprofesionaldelainformacion.com/contenidos/2015/sep/12.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/78372563 http://eprints.rclis.org/30325/ http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/49767/1/2015_Gonzalez-Diaz_etal_EPI.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3145/epi.2015.sep.12,0,,10.3145/epi.2015.sep.12,2115417473,,,9

This support will allow us to become an open access journal— eliminating journal subscriptions, fostering the broadest distribution of JAFSCD content. We are modeling our open access campaign on a model familiar to those involved with food systems—community supported agriculture (CSA)—to become a community supported journal. We are seeking pledges from food studies, food systems, sustainable agriculture, and other degree, research, and extension/outreach programs from around the world to purchase the open access shares in JAFSCD. The pledge campaign will run through August 31, 2017 (with payments due in September). If we meet our threshold of $65,000 in pledges, we will become open access as of January 1, 2018. As part of our effort to broaden JAFSCD’s reach and impact, we will soon begin to use altmetrics to look at our social media penetration as a measure of JAFSCD’s impact at the community level—especially in communities of intractable poverty and food insecurity. This is made possible with the support of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. This quantitative data, along with a stakeholder survey and story telling, should help us gain valuable insights into what practical change JAFSCD is fostering at the forefront of the good food movement, along with how JAFSCD is becoming more diverse and inclusive in its content. We hope you will join us in this endeavor by encouraging any program, organization, or department you are affiliated with to pledge now and annually, becoming a member of the JAFSCD Shareholder Consortium.

Hardy; Mathilde R. Desselle,"During a week-long celebration of science, run under the federally supported National Science Week umbrella, the Catch a Rising Star: women in Queensland research (CaRS) programme flew scientists who identify as women to nine regional and remote communities in the Australian State of Queensland. The aim of the project was twofold: first, to bring science to remote and regional communities in a large, economically diverse state; and second, to determine whether media and public engagement provides career advancement opportunities for women scientists. This paper focuses on the latter goal. The data show: (i) a substantial majority (greater than 80%) of researchers thought the training and experience provided by the programme would help develop her career as a research scientist in the future, (ii) the majority (65%) thought the programme would help relate her research to end users, industry partners or stakeholders in the future, and (iii) analytics can help create a compelling narrative around engagement metrics and help to quantify influence. During the week-long project, scientists reached 600 000 impressions on one social media platform (Twitter) using a program hashtag. The breadth and depth of the project outcomes indicate funding bodies and employers could use similar data as an informative source of metrics to support hiring and promotion decisions. Although this project focused on researchers who identify as women, the lessons learned are applicable to researchers representing a diverse range of backgrounds. Future surveys will help determine whether the CaRS programme provided long-term career advantages to participating scientists and communities.",4,,,https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/53989/ https://core.ac.uk/display/143904499 http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/10/170548 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.170548 https://eprints.qut.edu.au/114876/ http://research.usc.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/usc:25502 http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/121609/ https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:691750 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/143904499.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.170548,0,29134069,10.1098/rsos.170548,2757449446,,000-024-569-932-66X; 000-859-321-073-633; 003-197-419-911-008; 019-520-666-760-17X; 024-371-923-234-248; 025-011-482-322-791; 030-402-489-113-721; 030-491-590-171-763; 036-239-004-098-852; 037-884-805-705-649; 050-077-443-066-367; 050-455-462-524-55X; 050-841-743-599-801; 066-301-562-563-280; 076-478-574-785-047; 096-605-404-692-125; 108-413-387-276-740; 115-759-129-863-901; 130-669-693-286-345; 153-027-371-000-877,2

We explore a new method for answering this question by identifying 11 articles from two open access biology journals that were shared on Twitter at least 50 times and by analyzing the follower network of users who tweeted each article. We find that diffusion patterns of scientific articles can take very different forms, even when the number of times they are tweeted is similar. Our small case study suggests that most articles are shared within single-connected communities with limited diffusion to the public.

Several grand challenges concerning the creation, adaptation, and diffusion of scholarly knowledge, and advance quantitative and qualitative approaches to the study of scholarly knowledge are identified.",1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2016.00004/pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/frma.2016.00004/abstract https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160300812C/abstract http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1603.html#Chen16a https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00812 https://core.ac.uk/display/42687491 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2016.00004/full http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00812.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82850829.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frma.2016.00004,0,,10.3389/frma.2016.00004,2291349498,,000-362-876-321-908; 005-934-978-220-211; 008-866-729-947-425; 009-163-957-379-357; 009-498-363-490-044; 009-846-908-661-324; 010-523-311-870-210; 013-261-296-086-031; 014-546-460-777-666; 014-979-435-493-155; 017-995-231-763-984; 019-771-177-776-222; 020-647-409-662-919; 022-123-646-466-810; 022-937-239-559-027; 028-196-220-029-037; 028-784-838-059-01X; 029-064-006-690-790; 038-059-565-957-033; 041-410-527-170-41X; 044-334-096-634-776; 045-572-810-412-389; 055-508-721-025-797; 065-372-298-642-458; 072-207-491-450-460; 076-712-083-969-995; 089-939-826-801-180; 092-328-357-527-427; 093-779-978-973-429; 098-399-831-282-233; 099-187-831-959-795; 107-003-764-743-079; 116-545-996-099-174; 117-424-811-494-537; 122-598-599-782-793; 122-917-673-013-083; 142-711-078-921-425; 145-988-041-398-993; 191-342-365-011-850,9

The authors analysed 45 articlesin order to draw a picture of research in this area. In the first phase, the articles were classified, and relevant quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Results showed that three clear strands of research do exist: Digital Libraries, Networked Scholarship and Digital Humanities. Moreover, researchers involved in this research area tackle the problems related to technological uptake in the scholar’s profession from different points of view, and define the field in different – often complementary – ways, thus generating the perception of a research area still in need of a unifying vision. In the second phase, authors searched for evidence of the disciplinary contributions and interdisciplinary cohesion of research carried out in this area through the use of bibliometric maps. Results suggest that the area of Digital Scholarship, still in its infancy, is advancing in a rather fragmented way, shaping itself around the above-mentioned strands, each with its own research agenda. However, results from the cross-citation analysis suggest that the Networked Scholarship strand is more cohesive than the others in terms of cross-citations.

Of these, 44 came from universities and two from research centres. In total, 65 per cent of the repositories have the capacity to import data from and export data to other university systems, mainly Current Research Information System (32 per cent). Most repositories have mechanisms for the large-scale import and export of metadata and digital objects (83 per cent). The use of altmetrics in repositories is widespread (44 per cent). Authors and librarians deposit most frequently (37 and 32 per cent, respectively), in spite of the fact that 44 per cent do not have full-time staff working in the repository. In more than 80 per cent of the repositories, between 90 and 100 per cent of the deposits are full-text documents. With respect to the tools used to promote the repository within the institution, these are primarily face-to-face training sessions (82 per cent), followed by support materials such as manuals and help pages (65 per cent).

In the financial year of 2012–2013, the UK's charitable spending on medical research totalled £1.3 billion [1]. The Wellcome Trust is the second-highest spending charitable foundation in the world [2] and contributed almost half of this amount by awarding £538 million in support of biomedical research, development of medical technologies, and the medical humanities [3].; ; With such large investments in play, funders are naturally keen to understand and learn from the impact of the work they support. At the Wellcome Trust, the sort of impact we might expect can vary widely depending on the funding programme, from the discovery of a novel biomarker for childhood pneumonia [4], to the generation of a map of H7N9 infection [5] to assist epidemic preparedness in China, to heightened public engagement with science through the development of a video game based on the principles of Mendelian genetics [6].; ; Attempts to capture such a wide range of research impacts require a toolbox of methods and approaches to track the reach, use, and reuse of research outputs such as journal articles, datasets, and software. Expert peer review has long been and will continue to be an important component of judgements of the quality of research. Metrics, when used properly, can both inform and complement that process [7]; bibliometric analysis of research publications and their citation impact has been used for many years to provide a proxy measure of the impact of research within the scholarly literature [8]. Though we know that the impacts of research extend far beyond the academic literature [9]—to clinicians, policy makers, educators and the general public—accessible means of gauging this impact have not been so readily available.",12,Journal Impact Factor; Research/economics,,http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002003 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4244028 http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002003 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4244028/ https://paperity.org/p/60819197/alternative-perspectives-on-impact-the-potential-of-alms-and-altmetrics-to-inform-funders https://core.ac.uk/display/90087218,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002003,0,25423184,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002003,1980522530,PMC4244028,016-926-427-376-315; 021-132-507-303-470; 028-534-710-772-471; 036-120-861-690-596; 049-416-575-390-503; 051-965-959-247-371; 064-323-466-749-071; 064-464-535-000-515; 066-507-313-507-599; 090-602-655-587-782; 122-353-860-287-425; 160-462-293-223-417; 175-645-024-970-808,72

Rhee,"JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery is so fortunate to be able to showcase some of the best science and educational articles of the specialty. In a previous editorial,1 I had discussed the metrics that describe “High Impact Articles.” One of the metrics of impact is how often an article is downloaded or viewed from our journal website. With the assistance of our JAMA editorial team, I am pleased to share with you the top viewed articles of 2015 (Table)—Original Investigations, Review articles, and Surgical Pearls. TheOriginal InvestigationbyReilly et al2wasnot onlyone of the top viewed articles but also achieved one of the top altmetric scores (online attention; eg, news coverage, Twitter, Facebook) in 2015. Another interesting note is that the article by Klassen et al3 rose to the top of the list even though it was publishedso late in thecalendaryear; this speaks tohowmuch it has caught the attentionof our scientific community in such a short time span. As for Review articles, the breadth of the topics covered by the 3 articles, ranging from reconstructive to aesthetic, demonstrates thebroad interest baseof our readership. Finally, the Surgical Pearl article type is unique in the JAMANetwork and is one that has very quickly gainedmuch popularity among our readership. This concise, short educational synopsis coupled with a high-quality video has clearly become a valuable resource to our readers. Although I have chosen to showcase the 3 most common article types (Original Investigations, full-length Review articles, and a video-rich educational piece), there are other highly viewed articles worth mentioning that did not fit the 3 categories above. One of the most viewed pieces was an obituary written by our past editor, Wayne F. Larrabee Jr, MD, on the recent passing of one of our dear friends, Joseph Wong, MD, FRCSC.4 It was actually the fifth most viewed article of 2015. This type of interest speaks to the kinship and close personal ties in our specialty—something we can all be proud about. Finally, the top viewed article of 2015 was my welcome editorial as I transitioned into the role as editor in January 2015.5 Although our print issues continue to be well-received by our readership, I encourage you to visit our journal website, which is rich in content and is more interactive than the print issues. In the coming months, we will have a new website design that promises to be crisper, more userfriendly, and better able to leverage all of the related content in the JAMA Network; eg, content from related JAMA journals in the fields of dermatology, otolaryngology, and surgery. Thank you to the authors and readership for a tremendously exciting and successful 2015. As I enter my second year as editor, I am bullishly optimistic for an even more impactful year in 2016 and look forward to sharing the “Best of 2016” next year.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether successful scientists use their personal websites to disseminate their work and career details and to know which specific contents are provided on those sites, in order to check if they could be used in research evaluation. The presence of the highly cited researchers working at European institutions were analysed, a group clearly biased towards senior male researchers working in large countries (United Kingdom and Germany). Results show that about two thirds of them have a personal website, specially the scientists from Denmark, Israel and the United Kingdom. The most frequent disciplines in those websites are economics, mathematics, computer sciences and space sciences, which probably reflect the success of open access subject repositories like RepEc, Arxiv or CiteSeerX. Other pieces of information analysed from the websites include personal and contact data, past experience and description of expertise, current activities and lists of the author's scientific papers. Indicators derived from most of these items can be used for developing a portfolio with evaluation purposes, but the overall availability of them in the population analysed is not representative enough by now for achieving that objective.

Thus, this study examined whether there were differences in terms of scientific productivity or the visibility (both in terms of citations and social media metrics) of female and male scholars in the field of neurosurgery. To do this, 11,127 articles and reviews from 2012 to 2014 were extracted from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. This accounted for 14,944 unique authors. To study the visibility of neurosurgery scholars in terms of social media metrics, the following altmetric indicators were used: Mendeley readers, the post count of news, tweets, blogs, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The methodology and procedures employed included descriptive statistics, chi-square test, two-sample proportion test, and analysis of covariance. The results demonstrated that the number of female scholars was significantly lower compared to their male counterparts. Additionally, female neurosurgery scientists were found to be slightly less prolific in terms of scientific productivity.

Feist,"In this article, I argue that scientific fame and impact exists on a continuum from the mundane to the transformative/revolutionary. Ideally, one achieves fame and impact in science by synthesizing two extreme career prototypes: intrinsic and extrinsic research. The former is guided by interest, curiosity, passion, gut, and intuition for important untapped topics. The latter is guided by money, grants, and/or what is being published in top-tier journals. Assessment of fame and impact in science ultimately rests on productivity (publication) and some variation of its impact (citations). In addition to those traditional measures of impact, there are some relatively new metrics (e.g., the h index and altmetrics). If psychology is to achieve consensual cumulative progress and better rates of replication, I propose that upcoming psychologists would do well to understand that success is not equal to fame and that individual career success is not necessarily the same as disciplinary success.

Materials and Methods: Altmetric Explorer (Altmetric LLP, London, UK) was searched for articles published in 11 orthodontic journals without time limits in publication and citation on social media. The 200 articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) were collected and screened for data related to publication (date, journal, access), authorship (number of authors, affiliation and origin of the corresponding author), and research (type, subject, funding). Citation counts were harvested from Scopus. Results: The top 200 articles presented a median AAS of 8.0 (range: 5.0-196.0), and were mostly bookmarked in Mendeley (median: 16.6 references; range: 0-199.0). American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics, European Journal of Orthodontics and The Angle Orthodontist contributed 86 per cent of the total number of research outputs. Studies investigating socio-demographics had significantly higher AAS compared to diagnostic studies (median AAS: 19.0; range: 7.0-34.0; versus median AAS: 6.0; range: 5.0-10.0. No other study parameter was found to be statistically significant. AAS did not correlate to the number of citations as reported in Scopus. Limitations: The early stage of altmetrics and their complementary role in assessing together with the citation-based metrics the research impact need to be acknowledged in the interpretation of the results. Conclusions: Visibility of orthodontic articles on the Web is not significantly correlated with citations. Studies on socio-demographics had significantly higher number of online mentions.

Este articulo utiliza la popular enciclopedia online  Wikipedia  como un proxy del interes publico en la investigacion academica y evalua el grado en que se citan articulos de astronomia y astrofisica publicados entre 1996 y 2014. Se hicieron busquedas automaticas en  Webometric Analyst  a traves de Bing para contar el numero de citas a articulos de astronomia y astrofisica desde la Wikipedia. Los resultados muestran que los papers mas antiguos, de antes de 2008, tienen menos probabilidades de ser citados. Esto es cierto en general y en la mayoria de las principales versiones linguisticas de  Wikipedia , aunque puede reflejar los intereses de los editores en lugar de los intereses del publico. Esto concuerda con una tendencia moderada hacia la obsolescencia en el interes publico en la investigacion, aunque es probable que el fenomeno este influido por las fechas en las que se creo la mayoria del contenido de  Wikipedia  sobre ese tema. Los articulos pueden llegar a ser obsoletos si presentan la evidencia de que mas tarde fueron sustituidos por otros con datos mejorados o si proponen un modelo que luego se reemplazo. Abstract Astronomy is a natural science attracting substantial public interest. On a human scale, most individual celestial objects are essentially unchanging but is the same true for interest in astronomy research? This article uses the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a proxy for public interest in academic research and assesses the extent to which it cites astronomy and astrophysics articles published between 1996 and 2014. Automatic Bing searches in Webometric Analyst were used to count the number of citations to astronomy and astrophysics articles from Wikipedia . The results show that older papers from before 2008 are increasingly less likely to be cited. This is true overall and in most of the major language versions of Wikipedia , although it may reflect editors’ interests rather than the public’s interests.

The role of social media in increasing awareness of published works in neurosurgery has not been previously explored. Here, we present a qualitative analysis of the highest trending works in neurosurgery along with a correlation analysis with their social media metrics. Methods We performed a comprehensive search for neurosurgical publications using the Altmetric database. The Altmetric database provides a weighted total score of all online mentions for an article received on Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and mainstream media sources. Our search was limited to articles published within the social media era (January 2010–January 2017). Descriptive and correlational statistics were performed for all articles. The top 100 articles in altmetrics were selected for qualitative analysis. Results A total of 5794 articles were included in this study. The average Altmetric score in neurosurgical articles was 4.7 (standard deviation ±22.4). Journals with a social media account had significantly higher Altmetric scores for their articles compared with those without an account (P Conclusions This is the first study that details the spectrum of Altmetric scores among neurosurgical journals. Social media presence for journals is important for greater outreach and engagement.

We studied RCTs published during 2014 in five highly cited medical journals. This was a retrospective review focusing on characteristics of the individual trials and measures of citation and lay media attention. Primary outcome measures included citation count and Altmetric® scores (a composite score measuring attention in news, blogs, Twitter®, and Facebook®). Two hundred and forty two RCTs were included in the final analysis. Trial characteristics that were positive predictors of citation count included investigation of Hepatitis C treatment (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), private funding (r = 0.24, p < 0.001), mortality-related endpoint (r = 0.22, p < 0.001), and research setting within the United States (r = 0.13, p < 0.001). The trial characteristic that positively predicted Altmetric score was the population size potentially affected (r = 0.39, p < 0.001). The only negative predictor of citation count was the size of the population potentially affected (r = −0.21, p < 0.001). Negative predictors of the Altmetric score included investigation of Hepatitis C treatment (r = −0.21, p < 0.001) and private funding (r = −0.13, p < 0.001).

Azer; Sarah Azer,"Introduction Citation counts of articles have been used to measure scientific outcomes and assess suitability for grant applications. However, citation counts are not without limitations. With the rise of social media, altmetric scores may provide an alternative assessment tool. Objectives The aims of the study were to assess the characteristics of highly cited articles in medical professionalism and their altmetric scores. Methods The Web of Science was searched for top-cited articles in medical professionalism, and the characteristics of each article were identified. The altmetric database was searched to identify report for each identified article. A model to assess the relationship between the number of citations and each of the key characteristics as well as altmetric scores was developed. Results No correlations were found between the number of citations and number of years since publication (p=0.192), number of institutes (p=0.081), number of authors (p=0.270), females in authorship (p=0.150) or number of grants (p=0.384). The altmetric scores varied from 0 to 155, total=806, median=5.0, (IQR=20). Twitter (54%) and Mendeley (62%) were the most popular altmetric resources. No correlation was found between the number of citations and the altmetric scores (p=0.661). However, a correlation was found for articles published in 2007 and after (n=17, p=0.023). To further assess these variables, a model was developed using multivariate analysis; did not show significant differences across subgroups. The topics covered were learning and teaching professionalism, curriculum issues, professional and unprofessional behaviour. Conclusions Altmetric scores of articles were significantly correlated with citations counts for articles published in 2007 and after. Highly cited articles were produced mainly by the USA, Canada and the UK. The study reflects the emerging role of social media in research dissemination. Future studies should investigate the specific features of highly cited articles and factors reinforcing distribution of research data among scholars and non-scholars.",9,,,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/7/e029433 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371297 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/7/e029433.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029433,0,31371297,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029433,2964681226,,000-847-304-102-094; 000-924-423-111-993; 001-665-829-584-427; 002-724-351-029-697; 004-357-556-770-738; 007-134-350-812-489; 007-712-369-885-663; 007-715-369-888-083; 008-342-929-511-100; 008-604-255-536-148; 010-988-057-994-348; 011-213-024-136-323; 011-938-281-390-021; 014-182-703-023-806; 014-252-626-458-304; 017-792-833-105-188; 018-680-352-616-884; 021-464-451-505-057; 022-593-134-376-885; 023-383-634-804-816; 024-294-981-997-589; 025-899-996-479-512; 026-713-426-294-581; 029-065-704-440-662; 031-601-481-266-078; 032-936-292-740-982; 032-957-343-663-001; 033-167-527-356-487; 034-806-795-979-351; 034-902-655-580-031; 034-978-200-274-848; 036-802-945-814-451; 041-505-598-688-189; 042-353-977-067-979; 042-493-749-839-353; 044-396-940-377-829; 044-758-715-260-89X; 045-612-849-807-138; 046-094-102-098-985; 047-297-412-151-282; 047-907-137-317-270; 048-036-615-894-087; 050-099-380-012-130; 050-721-416-933-204; 051-225-143-003-418; 054-802-232-146-783; 054-929-391-990-437; 058-884-417-127-981; 059-090-593-648-411; 059-158-161-207-354; 059-754-418-257-535; 059-967-887-468-342; 060-686-682-097-415; 062-303-431-127-941; 063-532-277-943-208; 066-458-323-991-902; 068-143-379-559-402; 068-210-668-989-123; 072-561-710-292-979; 076-980-334-785-447; 078-216-217-085-512; 080-108-863-162-715; 080-706-389-886-547; 083-495-906-720-409; 085-467-698-510-187; 087-330-926-274-530; 089-238-850-238-584; 090-666-188-177-217; 091-008-418-033-625; 094-034-931-297-275; 094-454-935-510-089; 099-816-321-816-355; 102-314-160-817-555; 105-402-220-957-576; 107-540-064-741-527; 111-617-295-909-195; 115-611-693-589-842; 120-097-684-470-614; 123-326-155-467-167; 128-634-061-944-029; 129-033-347-516-487; 133-987-443-966-340; 134-078-428-157-666; 146-539-510-614-533; 146-889-441-198-571; 148-682-366-200-348; 161-946-179-316-887,0

Levi,"Objectives/Hypothesis; Evaluate the use of Twitter by otolaryngology journals and determine the relationship between social media altmetrics and measures of academic impact.; ; Study Design; Cross-sectional analysis.; ; Methods; Twitter profiles from the top 50 otolaryngology journals per 2016 SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) were included. Twitter activity for each profile was calculated using Twitonomy analytics and Riffle software. Social media influence was measured using Klout scores. Annual SJR rank and H-Index scores between 2008 and 2016 were recorded for each journal. Associations between social media influence and academic indices were assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test, Spearman's rank order test, and Pearson correlation coefficients (α = .05).; ; Results; Average SJR was 0.86 ± 0.3 and H-Index was 50.9 ± 24. Eighteen journals had Twitter profiles. Journals with social media accounts had significantly higher SJR (P = .03) and H-Index (P = .01) scores compared to those without. The average Klout score of Twitter profiles was 32.5 ± 13. There was a significant association between a journal's Klout score and SJR rank (P = .004). Older Twitter profiles had higher Klout scores (P = .04). There was a direct relationship between a journal's total Twitter followers and H-Index score (P = .009), and a direct relationship between tweets and academic influence (P = .03 and .01 for SJR and H-Index, respectively).; ; Conclusions; Social media is often underutilized and remains an untapped resource by many journals to increase readership and disseminate research. Journals with social media profiles had significantly higher academic metrics, and among journals with profiles, increased online activity was a predictor for academic influence.

Systematic reviews are an important source of evidence for health decision-makers, but have been found to lack assessments of the intervention effects on health equity. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) is a 27-item checklist intended to improve the transparency and reporting of systematic reviews. We developed an equity extension for PRISMA (PRISMA-E 2012) to help systematic reviewers identify, extract, and synthesise evidence on equity in systematic reviews. In this explanation and elaboration paper we provide the rationale for each extension item. These items are additions or modifications to the existing PRISMA Statement items, in order to incorporate a focus on equity. An example of good reporting is provided for each item as well as the original PRISMA item. This explanation and elaboration document is intended to accompany the PRISMA-E 2012 Statement and the PRISMA Statement to improve understanding of the reporting guideline for users. The PRISMA-E 2012 reporting guideline is intended to improve the transparency and completeness of the reporting of equity-focused systematic reviews. Improved reporting can lead to better judgement of applicability by policymakers, which may result in more appropriate policies and programmes and may contribute to reductions in health inequities.

Spiteri,"Purpose; ; ; ; ; Most studies pertaining to social tagging focus on one platform or platform type, thus limiting the scope of their findings. The purpose of this paper is to explore social tagging practices across four platforms in relation to cultural products associated with the book Casino Royale, by Ian Fleming.; ; ; ; ; Design/methodology/approach; ; ; ; ; A layered and nested case study approach was used to analyse data from four online platforms: Goodreads, Last.fm, WordPress, and public library social discovery platforms. The top-level case study focuses on the book Casino Royale, by Ian Fleming and its derivative products. The analysis of tagging practices in each of the four online platforms is nested within the top-level case study. Casino Royale was conceptualized as a cultural product (the book), its derived products (e.g. movies, theme songs), as well as a keyword in blogs. A qualitative, inductive, and context-specific approach was chosen to identify commonalities in tagging practices across platforms whilst taking into account the uniqueness of each platform.; ; ; ; ; Findings; ; ; ; ; The four platforms comprise different communities of users, each platform with its own cultural norms and tagging practices. Traditional access points in the library catalogues focused on the subject, location, and fictitious characters of the book. User-generated content across the four platforms emphasized historical events and periods related to the book, and highlighted more subjective access points, such as recommendations, tone, mood, reaction, and reading experience. Revealing shifts occur in the tags between the original book and its cultural derivatives: Goodreads and library catalogues focus almost exclusively on the book, while Last.fm and WordPress make in addition cross-references to a wider range of different cultural products, including books, movies, and music. The analyses also yield apparent similarities in certain platforms, such as recurring terms, phrasing and composite or multifaceted tags, as well as a strong presence of genre-related terms for the book and music.; ; ; ; ; Originality/value; ; ; ; ; The layered and nested case study approach presents a more comprehensive theoretical viewpoint and methodological framework by which to explore the study of user-generated metadata pertaining to a range of related cultural products across a variety of online platforms.",72,,,https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/fimspub/39/ https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-09-2015-0110 https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JD-09-2015-0110 http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=fimspub https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JD-09-2015-0110/full/html https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/13954 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55656531.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/jd-09-2015-0110,0,,10.1108/jd-09-2015-0110,2462473632,,004-424-081-598-141; 005-645-230-430-488; 008-285-770-922-240; 008-614-895-812-373; 009-297-073-679-657; 012-822-555-557-151; 015-013-726-939-074; 017-995-221-886-016; 018-392-325-202-807; 019-411-275-579-426; 022-812-629-226-376; 023-726-144-601-92X; 024-977-810-297-089; 026-224-991-861-166; 026-332-591-713-963; 026-575-910-031-078; 027-411-051-465-753; 029-018-635-018-764; 032-852-960-972-394; 035-048-510-991-127; 039-174-075-476-296; 046-251-158-344-109; 047-103-891-708-472; 050-768-639-660-491; 051-118-927-311-28X; 052-968-218-890-925; 055-457-844-403-148; 056-764-246-223-493; 064-901-223-956-713; 065-112-076-094-774; 065-892-771-429-249; 079-387-498-214-933; 083-214-156-661-687; 084-445-599-744-507; 084-467-485-269-610; 085-285-079-599-269; 087-632-727-888-840; 089-053-179-999-895; 090-188-704-624-025; 091-521-652-064-574; 093-248-351-019-41X; 094-463-586-605-868; 097-222-999-053-469; 099-254-398-330-001; 100-055-633-128-586; 107-149-865-010-546; 111-526-325-141-591; 112-557-258-121-205; 118-326-967-797-208; 119-384-714-144-796; 119-899-132-950-168; 141-078-266-476-798; 146-922-223-492-352; 147-648-386-016-606; 151-154-609-930-45X; 152-397-866-082-95X; 158-555-371-512-574; 176-988-538-033-468; 180-373-229-924-527,1

Universities normally use journal rankings and journal impact factors to assess the research impact of individual academics. More recently, citation counts for individual articles and the h-index have also been used to measure the academic impact of academics. There are, however, several serious problems with relying on journal rankings, journal impact factors and citation counts. For example, articles without any impact may be published in highly ranked journals or journals with high impact factor, whereas articles with high impact could be published in lower ranked journals or journals with low impact factor.

Altmetrics (Downloads, Views, Readers, Tweets, and Blog mentions) and bibliometric counts (Citations) (in this study, the indicators will be capitalized to differentiate them from the general language) of 5185 publications (19,186 observations) were extracted from PlumX to observe their distribution according to the publication age. Correlations between these metrics were calculated from month to month to observe the evolution of these relationships. The results showed that mention metrics (Tweets and Blog mentions) are the earliest metrics that become available most quickly and have the shortest life cycle. Next, Readers are the metrics with the highest prevalence and with the second fastest growth. Views and Downloads show a continuous growth, being the indicators with the longest life cycles. Finally, Citations are the slowest indicators and have a low prevalence. Correlations show a strong relationship between mention metrics and Readers and Downloads, and between Readers and Citations. These results enable us to create a schematic diagram of the relationships between these metrics from a longitudinal view.",12,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157717302870 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2018.06.001 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v12y2018i3p579-589.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2018.06.001,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2018.06.001,2805317804,,003-168-179-893-142; 004-924-180-697-031; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-537-281-905-239; 011-210-804-078-212; 013-231-440-030-220; 020-647-409-662-919; 021-376-441-945-059; 021-696-172-742-263; 024-704-447-017-762; 029-500-644-026-171; 040-160-721-123-582; 040-452-112-976-920; 040-761-208-292-979; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-472-143-393-282; 052-129-828-982-897; 052-190-066-692-721; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-831-901-562-709; 056-278-133-462-97X; 056-764-246-223-493; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-222-532-022-222; 059-363-063-370-29X; 063-144-189-164-648; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-897-343-637-16X; 068-224-488-858-924; 073-770-607-036-536; 076-399-144-464-512; 096-651-981-739-023; 099-816-321-816-355; 117-109-843-318-28X; 121-011-195-507-937; 122-353-860-287-425; 123-687-398-098-005; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-550-393-296-572; 130-317-737-525-24X; 130-446-333-613-121; 158-149-276-081-151; 163-591-801-241-575; 169-829-696-386-902,6

Vanden Heuvel; Jessica Bullenkamp,"The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about the reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from “Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells” by Garnett and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (Garnett et al., 2012). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 4C, 4E, 4F, and Supplemental Figures 16 and 20. Garnett and colleagues performed a high throughput screen assessing the effect of 130 drugs on 639 cancer-derived cell lines in order to identify novel interactions for possible therapeutic approaches. They then tested this approach by exploring in more detail a novel interaction they identified in which Ewing’s sarcoma cell lines showed an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Figure 4C). Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) transformed with the signature EWS-FLI1 translocation, the hallmark of Ewing’s sarcoma family tumors, exhibited increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib as compared to MPCs transformed with a different translocation (Figure 4E). Knockdown mediated by siRNA of EWS-FLI1 abrogated this sensitivity to olaparib (Figure 4F).

We review the growth of amplifier platforms and the academic and contextual reasons for their growth. Amplifier platforms are defined to distinguish them from traditional media outlets (where the scholarly voice is mediated through and 'gatekept’ by journalists, whose editors retain final control), personal blogs (very few of which can be maintained over time) and from social media platforms (where the scholarly voice is accorded no presumptive standing).

The name indicates that it begs to differ from classical bibliometrics by providing an alternative to citation analysis. “Altmetrics” itself was first proposed by Jason Priem on Twitter in 2010. Priem and his co‐authors then published the Altmetrics Manifesto in which they explain what altmetrics involves, how it can be used and what subjects it should focus on (http://altmetrics.org/manifesto). It also proposes studies to establish whether alternative metrics do measure the impact and influence of specific research or just represent background noise. To this end, the authors suggest that one could correlate various alternative metrics with traditional metrics, such as citations, or analyse their correlation with expert opinions. In addition, the manifesto addresses a major drawback of altmetrics, namely the susceptibility to manipulation; for instance, the difference between a good or bad indicator value based on Twitter often comes down to just a few tweets. Based on the initial Manifesto, Bornmann and Haunschild discussed principles to guide research evaluation [1].; ; Bibliometrics use citations from academic papers, which gauges the influence of specific articles on other scientific publications. In contrast, altmetrics use various other media to assess the impact of scientific publications. In essence, they involve counting references on social media such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, as well as news forums, blogs, online reference managers such as Mendeley and CiteULike, policy‐related documents (such as IPCC and WHO reports), and Wikipedia. In addition, altmetrics also measure views and downloads of scientific publications, along with reviews and recommendations of specific publications (such as F1000Prime, PubPeer and Publons).; ; Views and downloads of publications have been used as an alternative to …",19,"Bibliometrics; Journal Impact Factor; Peer Review, Research",,https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.15252/embr.201847260 http://embor.embopress.org/content/19/12/e47260.abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.15252/embr.201847260,0,30425125,10.15252/embr.201847260,2901077405,,001-647-844-038-388; 010-418-270-613-554; 021-120-673-715-990; 042-120-011-270-12X; 043-996-901-016-556; 055-808-236-401-052; 062-994-453-238-189; 120-870-232-770-910; 177-787-582-091-521,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the credibility and acceptability of the references of the Articles in the Field of Pediatrics Nutrition on Up-to-date Database based on bibliometric and altmetrics indexes. Methods: The studied articles were retrieved from database by searching word “nutrition” in the field of “Pediatrics”. After assessing the first 100 retrieved articles, 30 articles were selected with more relevancies. In the next phase, the indexes of all 1934 references used in 30 articles, which were in the Scopus database, extracted and entered in the prepared checklist. These indicators involved bibliometrics indexes such as Citation Count, Field-Weighted Citation Impact, and Citation Benchmarking as well as altmetrics indexes like Scholarly Activity (Mendeley and CiteULike), Scholarly Activity benchmarking, Scholarly Commentary (Blogs, Reviews), Mass Media, Social Activity (Twitter, Facebook) and Social Activity benchmarking. In addition, in order to determine the validity of the journals that publish these papers, SJR, IPP and SNIP indexes were extracted from Scopus database and entered the checklist. Results: The mean of Citation Benchmarking, Scholarly Activity benchmarking and Social Activity benchmarking with percentile of 80.5, 70 and 12.8, respectively indicated that validity of the used articles in terms of bibliometrics indexes had relatively good condition; but regarding to altmetrics indexes, in Scholarly Activity and Social Activity were in moderate and weak conditions, respectively. SJR and SNIP indexes of the journals with an average mean of 2.5 also indicated a moderate status for used journals. Conclusion: Due to the fact that the use of articles in the scientific community allocate more importance to determine their reliability and acceptability, high ranking of this index is a positive point, but it is still necessary to increase this rank with further use of the articles in the top percentile. The gap between scientific and social indexes is very high; this also demands more assessment of high percentile articles of these indexes in order to determine the cause of this difference.",7,,,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/Suppl_1/bmjopen-2016-015415.193 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/Suppl_1/bmjopen-2016-015415.193.full.pdf,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/Suppl_1/bmjopen-2016-015415.193,0,,,2597542028,,,0

Giving there are competing tools, it is important not merely to find the appropriate software, but have a metric for judging its usefulness. Journal's impact factor has been shown to be a poor predictor of software popularity; consequently, focusing on publications in high-impact journals limits user's choices in finding useful bioinformatics tools. Free and open source software repositories on popular code sharing platforms such as GitHub provide another venue to follow the latest bioinformatics trends. The open source component of GitHub allows users to bookmark and copy repositories that are most useful to them. This Perspective aims to demonstrate the utility of GitHub ""stars,"" ""watchers,"" and ""forks"" (GitHub statistics) as a measure of software impact. We compiled lists of impactful bioinformatics software and analyzed commonly used impact metrics and GitHub statistics of 50 genomics-oriented bioinformatics tools. We present examples of community-selected best bioinformatics resources and show that GitHub statistics are distinct from the journal's impact factor (JIF), citation counts, and alternative metrics (Altmetrics, CiteScore) in capturing the level of community attention. We suggest the use of GitHub statistics as an unbiased measure of the usability of bioinformatics software complementing the traditional impact metrics.",6,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00198/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00198,0,30619845,10.3389/fbioe.2018.00198,2903618128,,000-168-847-716-864; 028-800-911-277-740; 048-810-296-853-236; 051-965-959-247-371; 063-287-992-968-758; 063-753-807-473-952; 067-254-287-486-483; 079-797-726-196-08X; 099-615-323-002-127; 122-353-860-287-425; 124-828-193-357-862; 158-474-447-929-372; 160-560-057-897-662,1

Zhao; Bikun Chen,"As with articles and journals, the customary methods for measuring books' academic impact mainly involve citations, which is easy but limited to interrogating traditional citation databases and scholarly book reviews. Researchers have attempted to use other metrics, such as Google Books, libcitation, and publisher prestige. However, these approaches lack content-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of users. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic books can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric perspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by multi-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a book's impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn are crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted to identify review sentiment polarities and aspects' sentiment values. Lastly, the numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values, star values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the entropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores. The results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our method versus traditional book citations show that, although there are substantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to reflect the academic impact. Thus, we infer that online reviews represent a promising source for mining book impact within the altmetric perspective and at the multi-granularity content level. Moreover, our proposed method might also be a means by which to measure other books besides academic publications.",107,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1930-5 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1603.html#ZhouZZC16 http://blog.sciencenet.cn/home.php?mod=attachment&id=81899 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-1930-5 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:scient:v:107:y:2016:i:3:d:10.1007_s11192-016-1930-5 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v107y2016i3d10.1007_s11192-016-1930-5.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1930-5,0,,10.1007/s11192-016-1930-5,2306023980,,002-257-308-877-076; 008-998-283-383-315; 014-353-320-082-749; 014-974-459-343-888; 019-549-905-486-905; 022-939-920-698-174; 024-059-687-141-747; 029-165-255-951-763; 033-534-192-327-546; 034-913-941-917-209; 035-988-212-620-838; 040-602-288-422-121; 041-640-237-093-114; 048-486-922-097-684; 055-831-901-562-709; 056-764-246-223-493; 060-344-442-281-504; 069-166-463-323-097; 069-759-485-816-670; 073-420-511-868-290; 080-980-582-763-540; 085-211-231-477-329; 090-689-016-067-507; 093-518-275-280-364; 097-485-318-728-585; 099-318-317-726-953; 105-601-832-187-48X; 115-871-126-549-036; 122-353-860-287-425; 139-605-789-723-604; 161-081-423-299-661; 174-743-361-740-440; 176-237-796-688-830; 177-175-750-040-989; 198-259-141-659-399,9

Fernández-Ávila; Vaneza Ávila; Oscar M. Muñoz; Ángel A. García,"Background: Traditional system for assessing the quality and impact of a scientific journal is based on the number of citations. One of the main forms of measurement is the impact factor, which measures the impact that a journal has on the scientific community. Despite its traditional use, this quality and impact assessment system has been criticized in recent years. The “Alternative Assessment Metrics” initiative (Altmetrics) seeks to define new measures of metrics for scientific publications 1 . Alternative metrics are based on the number of “mentions” of an article in various online sources, including blogs and social networking platforms 2 . The alternative metrics are more dynamic and accumulate quickly in real time. The social networks most frequently used by scientific journals are Facebook, YouTube and Twitter Objectives: To evaluate presence, number of followers and activity of rheumatology journals in 3 social networks (Facebook, Twittter and Youtube). Methods: Platform of scientific journals SCOPUS was consulted, selecting journals classified as rheumatology journals. Scimago Journal Rank (SRJ) of 2017 was taken to evaluate the quality of the journal. The social networks Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were consulted, searching for rheumatology journals of those found in SCOPUS with active accounts in these social networks. Date of consultation: 13-11-18 Results: 61 rheumatology journals in SCOPUS, of which only 8 (13.1%) had an active account in at least one of the social networks consulted. On Facebook the most active and most popular magazine was Nature Reviews, followed by the Journal of Rheumatology and Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. It should be noted that Nature Reviews includes other journals in their social networks that cover other specialties of medicine such as cardiology, immunology, microbiology, oncology, among others. On Twitter, as on Facebook, magazine with largest number of followers was Nature Reviews, followed by Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases and Journal of Rheumatology. Activity on Twitter, measured as number of twits, had same behavior according to the number of followers. The only journal with channel on YouTube was Annals of the Rheumatic disease with 67 subscribers, 12 videos, of which the most watched has 315 reproductions. See table 1 Conclusion: YT and FB are social networks with a high content of false information. The majority of available videos promise to cure different rheumatic diseases (even several simultaneously). This is the first work of a line of research that seeks to highlight the high degree of misinformation. We will continue to analyze other diseases and social networks, to make publications and communications in different media and to alert local regulatory entities.

They can also be used as an information seeking aid: to help draw a digital library user's attention to papers that have attracted social web mentions. If altmetrics are to be trusted then they must be evaluated to see if the claims made about them are reasonable. Drawing upon previous citation analysis debates and web citation analysis research, this article discusses altmetric evaluation strategies, including correlation tests, content analyses, interviews and pragmatic analyses.

In order to obtain an understanding of how scholars at US higher education institutions utilize these sites, this study took ResearchGate (RG) as an example and collected data from 168,059 users from 61 US higher education institutions at three research activity levels as defined by the Carnegie Classification. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted, and four clusters of institutions with different behavior patterns were observed. The results indicate that US higher education institutions play different roles based on their academic influence in the network and demonstrate distinct behaviors in overall participation, information seeking, and information sharing. Users from universities of higher academic influence exhibited a preponderance for presentation behavior and were popular in the network, while scholars at moderate research-level institutions were active in seeking behavior as well as self-improvement. However, those at lower levels were comparatively inactive. The hierarchical clustering result also suggests that user behavior on this academic social networking site reflects the academic research activity level and level of academic influence accurately and effectively. These findings show a positive correlation between levels of scholarly output and utilization of academic social networking sites. This study also contributes to the ongoing efforts in understanding the scholarly use of academic social networking sites, and to the debate on whether associated alternative metrics (altmetrics) serve as supplementary evaluation measures of scholarship in higher education. The practical implications of the study are also discussed.",78,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10734-018-0339-x https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1222199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10734-018-0339-x,0,,10.1007/s10734-018-0339-x,2901701235,,000-245-603-109-650; 000-307-052-758-347; 001-159-184-276-045; 002-967-460-506-858; 003-252-718-494-610; 004-350-323-808-748; 005-808-575-904-822; 006-937-547-453-064; 007-591-764-471-42X; 008-150-591-136-318; 008-752-384-048-161; 008-876-250-444-569; 010-418-270-613-554; 013-475-441-790-257; 014-996-459-131-401; 016-552-823-956-246; 017-131-554-736-587; 019-957-068-329-154; 021-647-096-466-760; 021-696-172-742-263; 021-720-232-183-318; 023-908-097-601-309; 025-548-306-221-326; 027-008-686-650-450; 027-136-525-043-736; 030-104-538-930-643; 030-747-963-545-585; 030-830-095-392-351; 031-145-604-912-345; 031-640-222-701-479; 031-698-222-071-181; 032-269-710-493-085; 032-408-460-995-863; 035-040-134-486-840; 035-437-013-352-411; 037-787-607-399-48X; 039-776-208-949-789; 040-252-626-797-747; 040-761-208-292-979; 041-102-606-306-843; 041-943-172-365-200; 042-120-011-270-12X; 042-746-672-688-771; 048-421-366-629-821; 048-851-778-608-541; 051-160-455-799-545; 053-540-457-054-130; 054-583-066-554-134; 055-197-819-525-25X; 056-312-992-787-250; 058-516-494-428-121; 061-865-166-349-495; 065-124-019-101-999; 065-931-721-226-901; 068-054-121-684-113; 069-146-147-496-131; 069-169-184-648-685; 069-905-545-979-774; 072-192-308-462-553; 074-741-829-715-028; 075-267-966-095-209; 077-260-668-073-58X; 078-183-090-747-41X; 079-182-578-151-072; 081-700-685-738-230; 087-677-196-459-05X; 091-039-630-883-864; 095-294-885-936-204; 096-244-810-606-498; 101-517-725-082-255; 105-334-807-940-106; 109-527-953-385-629; 110-096-000-741-309; 110-309-926-544-567; 113-688-815-279-731; 114-709-668-802-735; 115-078-730-655-288; 121-026-414-834-260; 122-714-993-407-698; 128-260-151-904-238; 132-626-974-159-177; 135-223-962-472-273; 136-888-342-658-934; 138-072-668-440-274; 138-732-872-483-934; 138-967-197-905-844; 142-107-860-079-177; 143-113-483-748-183; 144-770-686-784-527; 145-825-967-023-881; 148-010-681-604-009; 151-021-034-823-506; 151-840-736-314-406; 155-979-640-387-856; 169-565-508-898-390; 171-898-426-858-827; 176-966-838-896-081; 178-989-972-792-894; 188-332-136-393-173; 194-094-266-241-326; 194-656-570-816-229,2

These include a variety of topics such as new discoveries in health sciences as well as “news you can use” information with practical tips (p. 3). Social and news media attention to scientific publications has been tracked for almost a decade by several platforms which aggregate all public mentions of and interactions with scientific publications. Since the amount of comments, shares, and discussions of scientific publications can reach an audience of thousands, understanding the overall “sentiment” towards the published research is a mammoth task and typically involves merely reading as many posts, shares, and comments as possible. This paper describes an initiative to track and provide sentiment analysis to large social and news media mentions and label them as “positive”, “negative” or “neutral”.

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag “good for teaching” do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag – if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented (“new finding”).

Scott; Lisa Hartling,"Objectives TRanslating Emergency Knowledge for Kids (TREKK) and Cochrane Child Health collaborate to develop knowledge products on paediatric emergency medicine topics. Via a targeted social media promotion, we aimed to increase user interaction with the TREKK and Cochrane Child Health Twitter accounts and the uptake of TREKK Bottom Line Recommendations (BLRs) and Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs). Design Quantitative descriptive evaluation. Setting We undertook this study and collected data via the internet. Participants Our target users included online healthcare providers and health consumers. Intervention For 16 weeks, we used Twitter accounts (@TREKKca and @Cochrane_Child) and the Cochrane Child Health blog to promote 6 TREKK BLRs and 16 related Cochrane SRs. We published 1 blog post and 98 image-based tweets per week. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was user interaction with @TREKKca and @Cochrane_Child. Secondary outcomes were visits to TREKK’s website and the Cochrane Child Health blog, clicks to and views of the TREKK BLRs, and Altmetric scores and downloads of Cochrane SRs. Results Followers to @TREKKca and @Cochrane_Child increased by 24% and 15%, respectively. Monthly users of TREKK’s website increased by 29%. Clicks to the TREKK BLRs increased by 22%. The BLRs accrued 59% more views compared with the baseline period. The 16 blog posts accrued 28% more views compared with the 8 previous months when no new posts were published. The Altmetric scores for the Cochrane SRs increased by ≥10 points each. The mean number of full text downloads for the promotion period was higher for nine and lower for seven SRs compared with the 16-week average for the previous year (mean difference (SD), +4.0 (22.0%)). Conclusions There was increased traffic to TREKK knowledge products and Cochrane SRs during the social media promotion. Quantitative evidence supports blogging and tweeting as dissemination strategies for evidence-based knowledge products.",8,Blogging; Child; Child Health; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Pediatric Emergency Medicine; Social Media; Translational Medical Research,,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/8/6/e022298.full.pdf https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/6/e022298 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/6/e022298,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022298,0,29880576,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022298,2805910805,,000-156-762-475-258; 000-596-366-937-173; 005-444-131-306-739; 008-055-479-816-334; 008-996-801-865-842; 011-210-804-078-212; 012-710-701-872-04X; 015-987-154-174-779; 017-150-370-532-858; 018-170-647-554-326; 019-662-366-465-228; 020-030-162-721-162; 029-659-010-228-42X; 031-180-419-408-183; 032-584-054-637-406; 035-201-117-342-583; 036-866-495-025-975; 039-825-122-145-235; 043-371-152-806-170; 043-813-999-743-473; 045-877-779-370-64X; 047-149-119-030-188; 048-284-162-273-140; 048-555-983-109-26X; 050-037-447-096-794; 053-998-838-929-88X; 061-468-719-714-474; 071-123-245-005-332; 079-092-856-629-656; 079-603-137-314-908; 081-179-030-180-921; 082-728-996-741-913; 091-344-875-586-324; 102-973-599-213-44X; 110-720-595-631-817; 120-152-440-682-812; 125-330-173-682-666; 137-331-637-241-253; 139-967-649-542-551; 143-741-292-906-801; 163-637-734-144-951; 166-588-285-398-809,3

É com grande alegria que iniciamos o ano de 2018 com algumas novidades.  O v.7, n.1 de 2018 estreia as publicações no sistema ahead of print. Este procedimento consiste em publicar artigos indicados pelos revisores e aprovados pelo Corpo Editorial da REGEPE, antes mesmo da composição final do número. Esta prática editorial propicia a rápida divulgação dos artigos, disponibilizando-os aos leitores na sua forma definitiva, além de dar visibilidade das produções dos autores. Tão logo completa-se o número de artigos, a edição é encerrada e o número subsequente é iniciado. O artigo publicado ahead of print amplia a divulgação da REGEPE e alcança novos usuários, satisfazendo as necessidades da comunicação cientifica atual.Além disso, recebe um DOI (Digital Object Identifier), código único permanente, que pode ser adicionado a documentos eletrônicos para sua rastreabilidade rápida e sem ambiguidades.No que se refere ao sistema editorial da REGEPE, o site informa as métricas alternativas: presença em redes sociais dos artigos, número de downloads e estatísticas das edições e por países (ver Barros, 2015). Essa métrica alternativa de impacto (Altmetrics), vem sendo adotada por bases de dados bibliométricas nacionais e internacionais (Scielo, Ebsco e Scopus). Na imagem abaixo, é possível observar a “altmetria” dos artigos publicados e as respectivas edições anteriores. </jats:p>",7,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14211/regepe.v7i1.937,0,,10.14211/regepe.v7i1.937,,,,0

Materials and Methods Two hundred and thirteen papers from 7 prominent urologic journals were examined 37 months after publication. Articles were evaluated with 2 citation based “bibliometrics” (Scopus, Google Scholar) and Twitter mentions were tracked using the Altmetric Bookmarklet. The number of article citations and Twitter mentions were compared using one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and bivariate fit analysis. Results Seventy-three percent of articles had at least 1 Twitter mention. Forty-two percent of Twitter mentions occurred within the first week of the online publication date. Articles mentioned on Twitter had 2.0-fold more Scopus citations (P Conclusion The majority of urologic publications are being shared on Twitter. The number of citations a urologic publication receives up to 3 years after release is positively associated with the number of mentions it has on Twitter.

Using the web based tool Impact Story, we collected metrics for 20,000 random publications from the Web of Science. We studied both the presence and distribution of altmetrics in the set of publications, across fields, document types and over publication years, as well as the extent to which altmetrics correlate with citation indicators. The main result of the study is that the altmetrics source that provides the most metrics is Mendeley, with metrics on readerships for 62.6 % of all the publications studied, other sources only provide marginal information. In terms of relation with citations, a moderate spearman correlation (r = 0.49) has been found between Mendeley readership counts and citation indicators. Other possibilities and limitations of these indicators are discussed and future research lines are outlined.",101,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v101y2014i2d10.1007_s11192-014-1264-0.html http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1507.html#ZahediCW15a http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1264-0 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02095 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-014-1264-0 https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1301 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150702095Z/abstract https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1264-0 https://128.84.21.199/abs/1404.1301,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1264-0,0,,10.1007/s11192-014-1264-0,1971087125,,000-827-073-807-610; 002-411-451-727-858; 002-666-995-736-984; 006-018-730-429-356; 007-446-858-302-247; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-387-674-493-027; 013-754-928-698-091; 014-605-846-064-279; 015-828-855-411-513; 018-065-396-992-107; 019-095-023-586-281; 020-647-409-662-919; 023-595-621-355-526; 028-800-911-277-740; 028-948-405-834-39X; 029-782-530-458-118; 034-605-737-341-631; 036-278-922-594-558; 036-909-353-190-796; 038-254-320-715-769; 040-253-834-590-550; 040-452-112-976-920; 040-754-546-913-138; 041-206-352-254-401; 043-495-392-935-371; 044-622-246-103-652; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-252-270-491-60X; 052-548-921-979-744; 053-086-790-955-429; 058-238-890-202-143; 063-626-019-318-642; 064-958-957-312-199; 065-091-202-739-116; 066-507-313-507-599; 068-155-247-870-555; 072-150-692-543-669; 073-474-712-890-703; 074-544-732-639-097; 085-001-502-383-40X; 086-809-706-245-39X; 090-885-354-392-642; 094-085-972-332-890; 099-816-321-816-355; 105-876-686-966-989; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 123-687-398-098-005; 123-987-158-461-797; 129-098-062-346-311; 132-238-138-313-349; 137-436-186-301-00X; 138-569-693-123-194; 141-134-741-084-026; 143-804-082-399-413; 149-086-710-081-997; 152-988-229-115-477; 158-692-766-410-880; 163-223-600-320-745; 163-595-480-871-354; 182-560-481-084-028; 194-541-388-311-793; 195-514-312-394-548,211

Problems may arise if, and when, marine scientists who enter the policy arena fail to understand these differing priorities, and we describe some common pitfalls. Various strategies are presented for marine conservation scientists to consider in order to avoid or minimize misunderstandings, especially with the media. Conflict of interest issues and public perception of bias are also addressed, as is misuse of research results and whether scientists have an obligation to correct misrepresentation of their research. Finally, we consider how marine scientists should address the inherent uncertainty in their results when those results are used to develop policy, including the importance of incorporating the Precautionary Principle when making science-based policy.",115,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569115001222 https://core.ac.uk/display/82706413 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569115001222 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82706413.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2015.04.016,0,,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2015.04.016,2145138558,,002-766-813-257-498; 006-366-487-404-255; 006-559-957-415-890; 006-704-698-367-959; 007-375-632-321-925; 007-944-450-858-534; 010-899-608-554-839; 012-580-069-935-744; 013-440-130-405-34X; 014-250-483-708-265; 017-659-202-784-257; 017-734-670-056-16X; 020-217-108-694-036; 022-146-678-585-963; 034-443-852-561-198; 038-798-742-159-948; 039-832-196-409-921; 048-861-816-829-054; 051-596-924-199-970; 058-397-596-667-271; 059-191-874-822-714; 061-507-356-207-623; 068-125-767-117-682; 073-774-791-038-387; 083-077-957-731-536; 086-321-696-467-773; 087-491-743-127-703; 088-525-456-396-774; 091-049-181-302-380; 103-854-123-090-24X; 113-357-903-752-107; 118-207-300-402-130; 121-709-136-815-248; 124-678-475-516-04X; 127-237-883-109-561; 128-852-421-377-87X; 134-613-663-155-451; 151-942-636-177-472; 155-077-941-045-910; 160-370-448-292-217; 161-155-871-648-270; 168-923-543-620-096; 171-399-173-752-453; 181-546-887-668-552; 182-819-104-385-191,18

Sixty-seven of them simply employed the counting citations to OA and non-OA articles; nineteen articles compared the downloads and citations counts; and twenty-one articles investigated the social impact of OA articles. Twenty-five articles investigated the citations, download counts, and social impact of medical articles.Conclusions: The studies investigating the citation impact mostly showed citation advantages. Those that employed citation and download counts of medical articles using randomized controlled trials showed that OA articles were downloaded significantly more frequently, but found no evidence of a citation advantage for open access articles. The citation advantage from open access might be caused by other factors.

The growth of scholarly content in social media and the use of altmetrics by researchers to track their work facilitate the advancement in evaluating the impact of research. However, there is a gap in the identification of evidence of the social impact in terms of what citizens are sharing on their social media platforms. This article applies a social impact in social media methodology (SISM) to identify quantitative and qualitative evidence of the potential or real social impact of research shared on social media, specifically on Twitter and Facebook. We define the social impact coverage ratio (SICOR) to identify the percentage of tweets and Facebook posts providing information about potential or actual social impact in relation to the total amount of social media data found related to specific research projects. We selected 10 projects in different fields of knowledge to calculate the SICOR, and the results indicate that 0.43% of the tweets and Facebook posts collected provide linkages with information about social impact. However, our analysis indicates that some projects have a high percentage (4.98%) and others have no evidence of social impact shared in social media. Examples of quantitative and qualitative evidence of social impact are provided to illustrate these results. A general finding is that novel evidences of social impact of research can be found in social media, becoming relevant platforms for scientists to spread quantitative and qualitative evidence of social impact in social media to capture the interest of citizens. Thus, social media users are showed to be intermediaries making visible and assessing evidence of social impact.",13,Biology; Communication; Genomics; Humans; Public Health; Qualitative Research; Research; Social Change; Social Media; Sociometric Techniques,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203117&type=printable http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/131248 http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203117 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0203117 http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/131248/1/689111.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203117,0,30157262,10.1371/journal.pone.0203117,2889275779,,010-242-782-778-938; 010-474-157-259-115; 011-402-581-074-682; 015-638-245-230-865; 015-826-745-723-509; 017-405-375-841-707; 018-541-858-186-957; 025-742-787-753-348; 031-056-855-501-837; 032-219-408-666-445; 040-452-112-976-920; 040-761-208-292-979; 044-496-105-738-334; 049-416-575-390-503; 054-026-744-214-082; 066-491-671-301-685; 072-463-767-991-704; 091-576-866-096-385; 105-597-778-781-576; 110-177-342-400-680,9

BACKGROUND Scientists are financially dependent on the general public. Salaries and research expenses come (directly or indirectly) from taxpayers. The public’s understanding and appreciation of research is a motivational force for scientists. This is possibly one reason that scientists like their work to be covered by the media. However, scientists have shown very little success in more directly communicating with the public about their findings. Despite the fact that scientists have been very successful in solving many seemingly unsolvable problems, (Fermat Last Theorem, stepping onto the moon, sequencing genomes for many species, unraveling the complexity of different types of cancers, discovering the importance and applications of the stem cells, to name a few), they have shown little success in telling the public about the value and significance of these achievements nor have they made the public aware about existing challenges, leaving a big gap between scientific communities and the public. Given the ever-increasing popularity of socialnetwork-based communications, scientists should ask themselves if they could use the potential of public Social Networks (SNs) for reducing this gap?",5,,,https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/publications/698997 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2014.00430/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266090/ https://doaj.org/article/bad84d130aa246d3baed7c9a15814dff https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2014.00430/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/43920841 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4266090 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2014.00430/full https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/publications/698997 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82872241.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2014.00430,0,25566317,10.3389/fgene.2014.00430,1988029960,PMC4266090,028-202-285-047-680; 072-761-347-950-039; 179-223-065-594-04X,16

Since the 2010s, altmetrics has become a common trend in scientometric research. However, researchers have not treated in much detail the question of the probability distributions underlying these new data. The principal objective of this study was to investigate one of the classic problems of scientometrics—the problem of citation and readership distributions. The study is based on the data obtained from two information systems: Web of Science and Mendeley. Here we based on the concept of the cumulative empirical distribution function to explore the differences and similarities between citations and readership counts of biological journals indexed in Web of Science and Mendeley. The basic idea was to determine, for any journal, a ""size"" (it is said to be the topological rank) of citation and readership empirical cumulative distributions, and then to compare distributions of the topological ranks of Web of Science and Mendeley. In order to verify our model, we employ it to the bibliometric and altmetric research of 305 biological journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports 2015. The findings show that both distributions of the topological rank of biological journals are statistically close to the Wakeby distribution. The findings presented in this study add to our understanding of information processes of the scholarly communication in the new digital environment.",5,,,https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(19)35749-4 https://www.heliyon.com/article/e02089/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019357494 https://www.heliyon.com/article/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02089,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02089,0,31388571,10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02089,2965269740,,001-757-928-198-829; 002-197-115-294-075; 008-150-591-136-318; 010-418-270-613-554; 015-094-171-477-335; 019-023-967-883-221; 021-120-673-715-990; 024-617-732-851-160; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-365-650-771-727; 028-570-190-453-802; 029-109-928-591-963; 029-500-644-026-171; 030-119-363-887-39X; 030-826-034-779-470; 032-324-365-161-862; 032-677-932-342-402; 033-892-099-999-989; 034-658-158-500-326; 035-741-014-700-752; 036-960-073-281-347; 038-871-841-614-422; 038-983-597-254-010; 039-966-848-160-572; 040-016-339-868-94X; 040-160-721-123-582; 044-120-876-816-980; 046-850-691-447-936; 051-472-143-393-282; 055-220-482-385-046; 057-286-311-076-534; 060-446-706-486-739; 062-015-113-624-743; 065-781-988-339-445; 066-058-608-660-901; 067-897-343-637-16X; 074-521-494-268-582; 076-399-144-464-512; 079-960-774-328-742; 082-207-674-261-593; 082-603-818-889-975; 090-958-442-251-078; 095-383-957-236-237; 095-661-194-276-886; 096-362-222-250-453; 099-049-757-168-710; 103-473-181-874-406; 104-370-639-684-685; 104-564-886-567-465; 105-395-385-823-338; 106-871-977-482-996; 111-747-486-947-210; 112-418-414-177-340; 114-774-084-549-589; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-459-426-080-507; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-098-062-346-311; 129-719-112-538-776; 141-257-490-542-634; 143-820-904-820-853; 144-524-678-595-837; 145-605-328-322-549; 146-046-930-226-363; 151-718-069-607-053; 169-763-138-924-404; 175-680-103-190-627; 184-902-475-673-424; 196-299-601-813-259,0

Particular attention is paid here to a targeted broad impact measurement: The aim is to discover the impact which a particular publication set has on specific user groups (outside research) by using altmetrics. This study used the Mendeley application programming interface (API) to download the Mendeley counts (broken down by different user types of publications in Mendeley) for a comprehensive F1000Prime data set. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system for papers from the biomedical area. As the F1000 papers are provided with tags from experts in this area (Faculty members) which can characterise a paper more exactly (such as “good for teaching” or “new finding”), the interest of different user groups in specifically tagged papers could be investigated. This study's evaluation of the variously tagged F1000 papers provided interesting insights into the use of research papers by different user groups. The most interesting tag for altmetrics research is “good for teaching”. This applies to papers which are well written and provide an overview of a topic. Papers with this tag can be expected to arouse interest among people who are hardly or not at all involved in research. The results of the regression models in this study do in fact show that lecturers, researchers at a non-academic institution, and others (such as librarians) have a special interest in this kind of papers. In the case of a key article in a field, or a particularly well written article that provides a good overview of a topic, then it will tend to be better received by people which are not particularly related to academic research.",9,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157715000450 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v9y2015i3p477-487.html https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2015.04.001 https://core.ac.uk/display/150337671 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157715000450,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2015.04.001,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2015.04.001,228784352,,003-075-869-802-612; 005-011-849-467-618; 009-303-522-533-513; 009-447-623-801-823; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-474-157-259-115; 016-908-615-847-314; 019-161-426-176-781; 021-120-673-715-990; 029-322-655-785-959; 029-500-644-026-171; 047-130-785-712-025; 049-416-575-390-503; 049-905-673-769-223; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 063-728-167-607-718; 066-058-608-660-901; 076-328-385-854-767; 079-343-312-870-007; 086-229-083-454-134; 093-004-530-053-970; 096-314-622-523-880; 102-161-046-039-361; 102-224-708-510-868; 105-402-220-957-576; 115-763-857-721-997; 121-011-195-507-937; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 130-623-328-861-459; 134-942-428-873-91X; 160-650-934-403-441,25

Debates over open access (OA), however, rarely extend from questions of distribution to questions of how OA is transforming the politics of academic knowledge production. This article argues that the movement towards OA rests on a relatively stable moral episteme that positions different actors involved in the economy of OA (authors, publishers, the general public), and most importantly, knowledge itself. The analysis disentangles the ontological and moral side of these claims, showing how OA changes the meaning of knowledge from a good in the economic, to good in the moral sense. This means OA can be theorized as the moral economy of digital knowledge production. Ultimately, using Boltanski and Thevenot’s work on justification, the article reflects on how this moral economy frames the political subjectivity of actors and institutions involved in academic knowledge production.",21,,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1368431017717368 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1368431017717368 https://core.ac.uk/display/96639872 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa33142/Download/0033142-06062017120440.pdf https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa33142 https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/BkFqNI4fBH8GHip9JBmc/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/96639872.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1368431017717368,0,,10.1177/1368431017717368,2622154930,,006-160-919-547-695; 009-526-234-443-466; 011-452-088-006-876; 011-963-559-999-187; 017-601-090-920-960; 018-057-865-400-320; 018-562-829-007-596; 020-898-677-585-266; 024-573-103-691-30X; 028-535-639-921-757; 036-123-778-287-038; 043-340-530-955-703; 044-521-491-817-680; 046-104-705-945-385; 053-807-452-982-341; 060-131-846-279-663; 064-161-380-129-681; 070-772-921-375-966; 076-597-268-936-283; 078-383-549-154-367; 082-704-517-702-786; 086-715-892-633-451; 088-463-622-040-677; 100-742-052-438-038; 106-777-744-772-166; 109-776-373-339-551; 120-548-919-702-820; 121-162-101-658-194; 126-682-168-202-643; 140-772-714-596-544; 144-202-432-651-374; 158-974-908-524-230; 159-850-661-705-663; 161-295-418-702-261; 163-723-423-599-028; 165-463-715-092-418; 166-097-913-305-583; 175-179-512-229-140; 175-919-937-239-003; 184-802-221-902-751; 188-335-812-670-169; 194-156-136-081-839,5

Kitas,"The Open Access Initiative is gaining momentum due to the worldwide availability of advanced digital tools, online publishing platforms, and systems for tracking academic contributions. Several declarations and initiatives, including Plan S, have already laid a foundation for moving away from subscription to full and immediate open-access publishing. The global initiatives imply targeting journals satisfying the upgraded quality and visibility criteria. To meet these criteria, a comprehensive approach to Open Access is recommended. This article overviews the essential components of the comprehensive approach, increasing transparency, adherence to ethical standards, and diversification of evaluation metrics. With the increasing volume of quality open-access journals, their indexing with free databases and search engines is becoming increasingly important. The Directory of Open Access Journals and PubMed Central currently free searches of open-access sources. These services, however, cannot fully satisfy the increasing demands of the users, and attempts are underway to upgrade the indexing and archiving of open-access sources in China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and elsewhere. The wide use of identifiers is essential for transparency of scholarly communications. Peer reviewers are now offered credits from Publons. These credits are transferrable to their Open Researcher and Contributor iDs. Various social media channels are increasingly used by scholars to comment on articles. All these comments are tracked by related metric systems, such as Altmetrics. Combined with traditional citation evaluations, the alternative metrics can help timely identify and promote publications influencing education, research, and practice.",34,"Databases, Factual; Open Access Publishing/ethics; Peer Review; Periodicals as Topic; Republic of Korea",,https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e184 https://www.jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e184 https://synapse.koreamed.org/pdf/10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e184 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624413/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e184,0,31293109,10.3346/jkms.2019.34.e184,2955748094,PMC6624413,000-570-720-204-373; 001-287-778-876-343; 001-779-242-781-996; 003-145-744-697-186; 006-086-958-753-050; 006-858-235-672-49X; 008-441-748-171-358; 008-920-597-545-575; 011-674-358-912-451; 013-298-897-780-300; 014-112-986-269-270; 014-783-696-735-621; 016-590-379-092-484; 017-754-505-747-272; 017-805-184-029-110; 018-098-758-970-935; 018-170-647-554-326; 018-357-240-792-058; 019-099-685-718-27X; 019-248-844-835-518; 020-227-303-006-47X; 020-843-431-734-964; 021-769-849-357-629; 022-064-532-083-945; 022-479-045-259-274; 022-943-421-706-389; 023-599-868-418-275; 024-108-690-014-034; 024-445-808-839-275; 027-196-320-837-334; 028-405-608-224-929; 028-821-562-030-629; 029-922-999-724-067; 029-944-861-818-893; 033-268-090-262-287; 040-701-993-873-319; 041-267-540-815-842; 042-275-057-692-607; 044-309-567-124-816; 045-567-982-937-61X; 045-642-699-447-954; 045-898-149-535-991; 048-616-621-613-844; 049-048-873-131-52X; 050-213-877-112-467; 055-868-177-014-822; 056-898-847-586-787; 056-919-736-753-116; 057-493-063-984-542; 059-605-810-978-442; 059-618-010-122-606; 060-051-838-777-160; 060-219-895-577-997; 064-055-690-891-322; 067-151-304-604-794; 067-655-416-840-66X; 068-094-354-330-339; 069-619-261-815-404; 072-607-401-733-794; 073-210-535-789-823; 080-311-013-897-911; 080-542-579-939-058; 082-470-873-676-44X; 082-667-562-831-819; 084-953-099-686-049; 085-707-445-875-321; 087-002-244-862-607; 087-644-222-126-785; 090-080-554-893-312; 098-744-272-680-183; 105-161-045-449-915; 110-665-070-765-450; 111-588-675-850-72X; 121-263-559-406-231; 123-233-758-562-830; 125-186-979-030-890; 133-448-089-635-211; 138-351-221-202-714; 139-933-828-062-515; 146-185-353-080-72X; 153-665-139-588-342; 160-158-482-435-965; 193-675-083-868-74X,4

In this way, articles tend to be discussed and the impact of these articles tends to be increased. In order to measure this type of impact, a new score (named Altmetric) was created. Altmetric aims to understand the individual impact of each article through the attention attracted online. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to analyze potential factors related with the publishing journal and the publishing trial that could be associated with Altmetric scores on a random sample of low back pain randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The secondary objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of these trials and their Altmetric scores. Methods: We searched for all low back pain RCTs indexed on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro; www.pedro.org.au) published between 2010 and 2015. A total of 200 articles were randomly selected, and we extracted data related to the publishing trial, the publishing journal, methodological quality of the trials (measured by the 0-10 item PEDro scale), and total and individual scores of Altmetric mentioned and Altmetric reader. The study was a cross-sectional study, and multivariate regression models and descriptive statistics were used. Results: A total of four variables were associated with Altmetric mentioned score: impact factor (β-coefficient=3.4 points), number of years since publication (β-coefficient=–4.9 points), number of citations divided by years since publication (β-coefficient=5.2 points), and descriptive title (β-coefficient=–29.4 points). Only one independent variable was associated with Altmetric reader score: number of citations divided by years since publication (β-coefficient=10.1 points, 95% CI 7.74-12.46). We also found that the majority of articles were published in English, with a descriptive title, and published in open access journals endorsing the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. Conclusions: Researchers should preferably select high impact factor journals for submission and use declarative or interrogative titles, as these factors are likely to increase the visibility of their studies in social media.

Web-based communities, facilitated by the adoption of social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are increasingly being used for knowledge dissemination, bridging the gap between knowledge generation and synthesis and knowledge implementation. Objective: Our objective was to implement and evaluate a structured social media strategy, using multiple platforms, to disseminate Cochrane Child Health evidence to health care providers caring for children. Methods: Our social media strategy had three components: daily “tweets” using the Cochrane Child Health Twitter account, weekly WordPress blog posts, and a monthly journal club on Twitter (“tweet chat”). Each tweet, blog, and journal club shared Cochrane evidence on a child health topic. We evaluated the strategy through (1) Twitter and blog site analytics, (2) traceable link (Bitly) statistics, (3) Altmetric.com scores for promoted evidence, and (4) participant feedback. We also tracked the resources required to write the blog, tweet content, and manage the strategy. Results: The 22-week social media strategy ran between November 2014 and April 2015. We created 25 blog posts, sent 585 tweets, and hosted 3 tweet chats. Monthly blog visits and views and Twitter account followers increased over time. During the study period, the blog received 2555 visitors and 3967 page views from a geographically diverse audience of health care providers, academics, and health care organizations. In total, 183 traceable Bitly links received 3463 clicks, and the Twitter account gained 469 new followers. The most visited and viewed blog posts included gastrointestinal topics (lactose avoidance), research on respiratory conditions (honey for cough and treatments for asthma), and maternal newborn care (skin-to-skin contact). On Twitter, popular topics were related to public health (vaccination) and pain management. We collected Altmetric.com scores for 61 studies promoted during the study period and recorded an average increase of 11 points. Research staff (n=3) contributed approximately 433 hours to promotion activities and planning (6.5 hours each per week) to implement the social media strategy, and study investigators reviewed all content (blog posts and tweets). Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence on the use of a coordinated social media strategy for the dissemination of evidence to professionals providing health services to children and youth. The results and lessons learned from our study provide guidance for future knowledge dissemination activities using social media tools.

This study aims to evaluate the research production of 14 Saudi Emergency Medicine training departments, from January 2000 to June 2016. From April to July 2016, we searched for articles published by first authors affiliated with Saudi Emergency Medicine training centers. We searched for original articles using the following search engines: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, Scopus, Inspec, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and Cochrane Central Registers. Based on previous literature, we used certain metrics to evaluate the articles: journal’s impact factor, number of citations by Web of Science, number of citations by Google Scholar, and Altmetric score. Out of 9520 publications screened, only 76 articles were included for evaluation. The average number of publications per year was 4.7. However, it increased from two publications in year 2000 to 14 publications in 2015. Most of the publications (n = 65, 86%) were in journals with no or low IF (IF < 2). Although, there is progressive improvement in the quantity and quality of research from Saudi Emergency Medicine training departments, there should be more eff ort to reach to a higher level of research production.",23,,,http://jkaumedsci.org.sa/index.php/jkaumedsci/article/view/515,http://dx.doi.org/10.4197/med.23-4.1,0,,10.4197/med.23-4.1,2912633243,,,0

With regard to article type, Type I papers are those wherein the authors are all from China or the USA. Type II are those in which the first author is from China or the USA. Type III includes those in which the first author is not from China or the USA. We found that the proportion of OA papers in WoS has been growing in recent years. In terms of citations and altmetric indexes, the mean value of the USA is larger than that of China in general; Type II articles possess the highest value among all papers in the USA, whereas Type III has the highest value in China. Compared with the scenario in citations, social sciences and humanities possess larger altmetric values in China and the USA. The correlation among indicators is similar for the OA papers from China and the USA. Generally, citations cannot effectively represent the altmetric indexes. The gap between China and the USA is the largest in the altmetric attention score and Type I, and the smallest in citations and Type III.

Lüscher,"Publishing is an important step in the scientific process—only published data do exist. However, publishing is more than just making data publically available. Writing and submitting a manuscript forces researchers to put their data together, analyse them appropriately, make sense of them, and discuss their implications for science and medicine. Thus, publishing also means finishing a project, answering the question raised, and assessing its importance.1; ; Starting from the ancient Greek philosophers and physicians up to today's modern science, discoveries have been written down in books and papers for the use of current and future readers. Ever since, but particularly so over the last decades, the number of scientific journals and publications has increased tremendously ( Figure 1 ; altmetrics.org)—this comes at no surprise as most scientists who have worked in the entire human history are active today. As a result, on average, ∼530 000 scientific papers are entered in PubMed every year from close to 40 000 journals worldwide and it is anticipated that with the rise of novel scientific nations, this number will increase further. ; ; ; ; Figure 1 ; Number of papers published over time.; ; Source: altmetrics.org.; ; Given the vast number of scientific journals, one may ask the question: Do we need new journals? Of course, one could argue that we have got enough. On the other hand, science and medicine has grown so large and in turn has produced specialties and sub-specialities and sub-subspecialities that the once unified scientific community has separated into an increasing number of distinct fields of interest. Most of these communities work on different topics and often use their own language. Even in cardiology, once a sub-speciality of internal medicine, sub-specialties have grown into communities of their own right.; ; Thus, also the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), starting with a single journal in 1980, i.e. the European Heart Journal (EHJ), … ; ; [↵][1]*Corresponding author.

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI), as an emerging interdiscipline, has a rapid development in these years. Traditional indices can’t reflect the influence of the AI research outputs quickly, thus more timely altmetrics indices are needed. In this paper, we conduct four studies about altmetrics indices and AI research outputs based on the datasets collected from Altmetric.com and Scopus database. First, we provide a review of the research status in the AI field. Second, we show the AI researches that attracted the most attention. Third, we demonstrate the general effectiveness of altmetrics indices in the AI field. Last, we examine the effectiveness of altmetrics indices for different levels of AI journal papers and AI conference papers. Our results indicate that there is a rapid increase of AI publications and the public has paid more attention to AI research outputs since 2011. It is found that altmetrics indices are effective to discriminate highly cited publications and publications whose citation counts increase quickly. Among all Altmetric sub-indicators, Number of Mendeley readers is the most effective. Moreover, the results indicate that altmetrics indices are more effective in high levels of AI journal papers and AI conference papers. The main contribution of this paper is investigating the effectiveness of altmetrics indices from the perspective of different levels of publications. This study lays the foundation for further investigations about effectiveness of altmetrics indices from new perspectives, and it has important implication for the studies about the impact of social media on the scientific community.",119,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-019-03088-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03088-x,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03088-x,2939840067,,000-114-141-599-148; 003-341-064-889-924; 003-902-916-862-498; 005-278-577-590-526; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-286-995-050-603; 010-418-270-613-554; 012-687-178-527-213; 012-717-760-048-191; 015-755-520-290-700; 017-207-079-393-316; 023-271-041-203-090; 023-438-345-162-875; 023-706-454-641-232; 025-682-263-777-734; 026-458-712-539-767; 028-227-833-509-542; 040-252-626-797-747; 040-334-359-133-362; 040-452-112-976-920; 040-761-208-292-979; 040-943-292-199-335; 043-326-298-968-591; 045-065-800-988-484; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-970-497-154-180; 054-802-232-146-783; 057-690-278-742-041; 059-222-532-022-222; 066-507-313-507-599; 072-431-599-140-823; 076-475-250-152-303; 076-730-596-742-437; 079-797-726-196-08X; 080-418-584-620-246; 084-493-096-174-158; 084-947-919-098-277; 088-882-210-820-542; 090-958-442-251-078; 096-633-085-768-994; 099-816-321-816-355; 103-004-964-289-957; 104-748-942-678-757; 110-457-195-877-695; 111-531-383-476-599; 116-005-314-582-189; 116-545-996-099-174; 117-472-869-381-363; 121-707-574-802-675; 122-073-156-920-876; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 139-651-430-124-012; 141-277-482-556-540; 142-191-407-691-450; 145-741-153-196-611; 151-286-811-857-481; 173-246-227-106-437; 174-834-926-581-955; 180-559-374-049-445; 189-270-007-235-318; 193-123-800-849-774; 196-441-056-369-328,1

Methods Historical, descriptive, and exploratory bibliometrics analyses were used. The papers were harvested from the Scopus bibliographical database (Elsevier, Maribor, Netherlands), on November 18th, 2018, using the search string bibliometric* in publication titles, abstracts, and keywords, limited to the subject of nursing, for the period 1970 to 2018. Findings The search resulted in 531 publications with 18 publications removed after manual inspection of publications abstracts. The literature production trend was positive. The nursing specific historical roots appeared only recently. The United States of America and Spain were the most productive countries, and most papers were published in Nutricion Hospitalaria and the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Descriptive analysis, research evaluation, content analysis, citation analyses, and trend analysis in nursing research were the most prolific themes. Conclusions Applications of bibliometric in nursing is comparable to bibliometrics use in general, however there are some gaps including the use of altmetrics and of Big Data analysis.",67,"Bibliometrics/history; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Nursing Research/history; Publications/history; Research Report/history",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029655418307309,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2019.04.009,0,31204025,10.1016/j.outlook.2019.04.009,2943000928,,000-107-004-725-165; 000-458-453-477-624; 002-052-422-936-00X; 002-257-308-877-076; 002-883-081-413-40X; 005-389-787-220-058; 005-990-034-936-34X; 006-679-822-035-15X; 008-836-261-884-432; 010-020-294-922-765; 010-605-036-971-058; 010-725-006-778-35X; 010-806-199-849-322; 011-077-936-171-179; 011-927-834-144-143; 014-229-461-717-850; 014-572-286-095-211; 016-892-883-047-969; 018-491-459-534-413; 020-771-580-608-662; 022-147-398-970-87X; 023-086-316-490-750; 024-488-597-925-762; 024-491-347-287-793; 025-824-143-908-307; 026-146-504-911-218; 026-292-185-225-864; 026-760-596-004-219; 027-386-385-281-629; 027-502-980-180-043; 027-662-695-988-839; 028-022-428-881-026; 028-639-407-778-054; 030-621-729-787-830; 030-759-083-242-285; 030-818-732-354-170; 034-105-921-015-739; 035-739-350-071-411; 036-199-895-543-222; 036-753-708-390-642; 038-065-575-854-848; 038-891-966-588-406; 039-505-270-645-642; 040-563-004-848-237; 040-721-631-385-316; 045-070-844-829-73X; 047-249-404-575-695; 047-273-317-607-724; 050-309-524-504-015; 054-212-407-900-662; 055-220-482-385-046; 055-961-054-955-119; 056-292-247-053-323; 056-323-080-505-98X; 057-231-650-911-348; 059-177-647-297-170; 062-182-359-654-668; 063-624-706-289-047; 063-790-294-230-260; 066-163-416-226-902; 066-853-704-371-90X; 070-644-473-950-755; 072-116-832-456-403; 075-286-799-653-317; 076-835-316-844-22X; 077-190-305-635-28X; 077-246-216-426-515; 078-448-638-876-294; 079-358-089-859-658; 084-143-834-197-221; 086-426-133-331-160; 093-657-839-731-563; 097-389-591-157-947; 098-727-932-864-363; 101-574-459-461-260; 102-398-833-330-903; 104-065-171-658-156; 110-315-636-499-420; 111-067-672-422-478; 113-999-511-856-622; 120-400-188-964-171; 121-077-581-164-014; 121-895-261-211-904; 123-668-568-608-01X; 124-552-186-290-562; 126-594-535-567-290; 127-640-854-541-304; 128-518-301-677-700; 132-723-851-457-646; 134-852-298-932-483; 137-731-779-699-000; 138-561-175-358-392; 141-200-607-894-303; 147-199-278-864-535; 152-219-071-626-237; 154-119-927-928-879; 167-985-418-930-738,1

Our research reveals that the greatest minds are gone but not forgotten. Their scientific impacts on human history have persisted for centuries. We also find evidence in support of own-group fame preference, i.e., that the scientists have greater reputations in their home countries or among scholars sharing the same languages.

In this study, we aim to assess the status of RCTs in Ophthalmology. Methods: On 15 th of May 2019, we performed a PubMed search for randomized controlled trials published in the field of ophthalmology using relevant filters and search terms. We categorized the results into specific topics in ophthalmology according to Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) database classification system. We used Altmetric explorer to identify journals and articles with the highest number of RCTs and highest citations. Results: We found a total of 540,427 publications in the field of ophthalmology, of which only 11,634 (2.15%) of them were RCTs. ‘Retinal diseases’ was the topic with the highest number of RCTs, followed by ‘glaucoma’ and ‘conjunctival diseases’. The trial with highest number of citations was on retinal diseases. Only around 18% of all ophthalmology RCTs are published in the top 10 ophthalmology journals, with a maximum percentage of RCTs was (5.53%) published in Ophthalmology . Conclusion: RCTs in ophthalmology primarily concern the retina, glaucoma, and a few other sub-topics, with little focus on sclera, orbit, and the eyelids. Most of the high impact RCTs are published in non-ophthalmology journals.",8,,,https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1718 https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1718/v1/xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20673.1,0,,10.12688/f1000research.20673.1,2978717284,,000-160-880-462-089; 003-762-208-794-891; 003-987-938-722-23X; 010-244-945-866-561; 013-663-687-650-762; 015-687-286-965-172; 023-638-369-959-180; 025-495-446-540-525; 028-554-827-117-727; 033-327-152-533-79X; 035-964-848-340-165; 045-315-550-731-721; 050-419-898-430-468; 051-966-873-662-296; 060-294-027-626-517; 063-123-144-836-508; 067-941-829-635-493; 068-462-156-872-029; 101-350-712-721-829; 104-918-730-248-770,0

To describe evidences of certain bibliographic issues and their influence on altmetrics and bibliometrics indicators, considering a set of Brazilian, Spanish and Portuguese articles. Design/Methodology/Approach . From an exploratory approach, a total of 133 articles, available in ScienceOpen and best-positioned from the altmetrics counts, have been analyzed according to characteristics as publication date, authorship and collaboration, subject area, language, number of citations and, finally, altmetrics values derived from altmetric attention scores and mentions collected by Altmetric. Results/Discussion . Data show differences among countries regarding some issues – for example, number of authors by article, or language of publication - for the best-positioned articles in altmetrics rankings. For the whole sample, it is remarkable that more recent articles obtain more mentions and shared authorship is usual. Conclusions . Altmetrics evaluate visibility and reception of academic articles in web and social media, so they enrich citation data and extend the scope of the scientific production beyond the academic community. It is required to study and understand the social impact of science and to identify which elements of the publication process have direct influences over the popularization of scientific research. Originality/Value . Besides of dealing with a sample of Ibero-american articles, usually underrepresented in bibliometric databases, this study emphasizes the complementary role of the different dimensions that have to be taken into account in scientific communication.",14,,,http://eprints.rclis.org/33180/ http://revistas.bnjm.cu/index.php/anales/article/view/4244/3897 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/6484266.pdf https://biblat.unam.mx/es/revista/bibliotecas-anales-de-investigacion/articulo/indicadores-altmetricos-y-de-citacion-en-la-produccion-cientifica-en-scienceopen-estudio-descriptivo-para-brasil-espana-y-portugal,http://eprints.rclis.org/33180/,0,,,2806738500,,,1

Fluid loading was similar in the two groups. The two primary end points were new infection acquired during the ICU stay and the adjusted duration of ICU dependency, as assessed by the number of days in the ICU and as time to discharge alive from ICU. For the 723 patients receiving early parenteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition was initiated within 24 hours after ICU admission, whereas for the 717 patients receiving late parenteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition was not provided until the morning of the 8th day in the ICU. In both groups, enteral nutrition was attempted early and intravenous micronutrients were provided.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Although mortality was similar in the two groups, the percentage of patients with a new infection was 10.7% in the group receiving late parenteral nutrition, as compared with 18.5% in the group receiving early parenteral nutrition (adjusted odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.66). The mean (±SE) duration of ICU stay was 6.5±0.4 days in the group receiving late parenteral nutrition, as compared with 9.2±0.8 days in the group receiving early parenteral nutrition; there was also a higher likelihood of an earlier live discharge from the ICU at any time in the late-parenteral-nutrition group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.37). Late parenteral nutrition was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilatory support than was early parenteral nutrition (P=0.001), as well as a smaller proportion of patients receiving renal-replacement therapy (P=0.04) and a shorter duration of hospital stay (P=0.001). Late parenteral nutrition was also associated with lower plasma levels of γ-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase than was early parenteral nutrition (P=0.001 and P=0.04, respectively), as well as higher levels of bilirubin (P=0.004) and C-reactive protein (P=0.006).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In critically ill children, withholding parenteral nutrition for 1 week in the ICU was clinically superior to providing early parenteral nutrition.

Specifically, published articles in prominent journals citing other published articles in other prominent journals equate to prestige and tenure. Metrics can now be harvested and applied to research around usage, captures, mentions, and social media, in addition to citations, giving a much more comprehensive and holistic view of impact. These new metrics are also much more timely than citation metrics and can keep pace with new formats much faster than the entrenched, legacy practices. In this session, we will highlight some practical ways institutions are using these new metrics today and what the future holds.",,,,https://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/SCS/article/download/3241/3087 http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/SCS/article/view/3241/3087,http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/5.3241,0,,10.7557/5.3241,1999320402,,,0

Research administrators, grant offices, researchers, students and university managers, among others, are increasingly turning to academic librarians for information to meet their myriad research-related information and metrics needs. Sub-Saharan African countries’ emphasis on strengthening science, technology and innovation has exerted further pressure on information professionals and other stakeholders to develop and appropriately apply bibliometrics and altmetrics to inform decision-making and policy-formulation processes. Research output and impact metrics are not only quickly evolving but their volume has been unprecedented. This paper’s focus is the application of bibliometrics and altmetrics by academic librarians to support researchers in their respective universities. The paper argues that there is need for up-skilling or re-skilling the 21 st -century sub-Saharan African academic librarian to select and apply appropriate metrics, tools and strategies to support researchers as they execute their responsibilities.

Sugimoto,"Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.",8,Bibliometrics; Humans; PubMed; Publishing; Social Media,,https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/altmetrics-work-twitter-ten-other-social-web-services/ https://www.ost.uqam.ca/publications/do-altmetrics-work-twitter-and-ten-other-social-web-services/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665624/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PLoSO...864841T https://paperity.org/p/60557989/do-altmetrics-work-twitter-and-ten-other-social-web-services http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3665624 https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=3ac2507d-2120-4abc-b252-b545340dffb5 http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0064841 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064841 https://crc.ebsi.umontreal.ca/en/publications/do-altmetrics-work-twitter-and-ten-other-social-web-services/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064841,0,23724101,10.1371/journal.pone.0064841,2073023209,PMC3665624,003-078-576-803-447; 003-168-179-893-142; 003-254-479-923-236; 005-699-111-606-288; 006-018-730-429-356; 008-812-618-060-828; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-194-028-604-828; 013-331-505-668-726; 015-700-245-441-595; 016-574-404-432-904; 017-349-318-774-487; 018-246-118-548-105; 019-658-209-137-261; 020-574-736-729-573; 026-690-594-587-368; 032-858-825-665-444; 035-964-848-340-165; 040-452-112-976-920; 046-261-734-693-737; 047-787-501-272-838; 049-416-575-390-503; 049-905-673-769-223; 050-252-270-491-60X; 053-086-790-955-429; 058-483-970-541-283; 064-509-241-094-364; 065-813-744-561-991; 067-715-519-706-692; 071-615-277-709-925; 075-563-711-739-195; 077-475-585-030-099; 086-809-706-245-39X; 089-914-448-038-331; 099-816-321-816-355; 110-457-195-877-695; 116-004-210-033-746; 117-109-843-318-28X; 123-687-398-098-005; 124-490-028-694-122; 129-098-062-346-311; 141-134-741-084-026; 153-376-062-165-585; 165-270-789-002-269; 177-787-582-091-521; 185-099-554-359-448,458

There are two major types of citation-based metrics: the count of cites per paper and the count of papers with significant citations, as exemplified by the h -index. Orthopaedic journals are more likely to be underrated by most citation-based metrics, and this is accounted for by the lower citation potentials. Ranking of orthopaedic journals based on different citation metrics demonstrated a reasonably suitable accordance, but numerous orthopaedic journals experienced greater discrepancies in the measures of the journal's popularity and prestige. Citation-based ranking should not be equated with the scholarly performance of a journal; other criteria to evaluate the “impacts” of journals should be explored as well, such as clinical impacts rated by clinicians. Journal rankings and citation metrics are often used by universities, hospitals, research institutions, and granting agencies for performance assessment and resource allocation. The clinical impact and, to a certain extent, the emphasis on the quality of patient care, are not given the deserved recognition and are not priority considerations. This article sets the tone for a comprehensive review of the journal ranking system in orthopaedics.",2,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214031X14000266 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214031X14000266 https://core.ac.uk/display/82555000 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82555000.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2014.03.005,0,,10.1016/j.jot.2014.03.005,2169340164,,001-001-342-111-52X; 026-151-614-993-118; 026-838-880-048-005; 044-489-501-001-590; 046-666-148-271-609; 050-022-444-064-55X; 051-393-927-414-365; 063-022-842-309-825; 065-978-507-980-880; 101-752-490-869-458; 116-545-996-099-174; 159-530-467-592-13X; 185-028-807-802-025,1

Se o campo for considerado de forma mais ampla, tomando-se, como exemplo, estudos cientométricos a partir de dados cibermétricos ou webométricos, é possível identificar trabalhos mais antigos. Entretanto, o processo de delimitação do referido campo se deu em 2010, quando Jason Priem cunhou o termo “altmetrics” via Twitter, tendo o mencionado vocábulo chegado ao Brasil como “altmetria” em 2013. No estudo bibliométrico exploratório aqui apresentado é utilizada a base de currículos Lattes para identificar artigos e comunicações em congressos de pesquisadores, com ou sem doutorado, que atuam no campo da altmetria no Brasil. Ademais, serão também identificadas as suas grandes áreas, além de áreas de atuação, distribuição geográfica e a evolução de fontes de dados e as temáticas ao longo dos anos. Para tanto, foi efetuada a identificação dos currículos por intermédio da busca avançada na Plataforma Lattes, utilizando-se os termos “altmetria”, “altmétrico”, “altmétrica”, “altmetric” ou “altmetrics”. Os 94 currículos encontrados, sendo 37 de doutores e 57 de não doutores, tiveram seus conteúdos filtrados pelos termos de busca utilizados. Foram identificados 26 artigos em periódicos e 36 comunicações em congressos. Dos 94 pesquisadores, 53 deles produziram apenas em altmetria e 41 produziram valendo-se da intercessão com Facebook, Twitter ou Mendeley. O campo é dominado por pesquisadores da grande área de Ciências Sociais Aplicadas, destacando-se a Ciência da Informação e, em menor grau, a área da Comunicação. As abordagens vêm evoluindo, percorrendo um caminho que vai desde aquelas mais teóricas até as práticas, avaliativas, críticas e as contextualizações institucionais e regionais.</jats:p>",31,,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/tinf/v31/2318-0889-tinf-31-e190027.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/2318-0889201931e190027,0,,10.1590/2318-0889201931e190027,2977009086,,002-052-422-936-00X; 005-831-824-829-700; 009-795-057-711-030; 011-514-661-248-378; 020-810-684-234-609; 022-207-714-797-063; 024-491-347-287-793; 025-352-608-374-964; 027-773-611-888-913; 038-581-462-864-557; 063-897-926-484-016; 065-213-252-792-479; 066-073-926-569-578; 066-839-689-325-444; 087-802-624-733-386; 089-914-448-038-331; 099-816-321-816-355; 107-079-075-467-321; 107-680-584-361-32X; 127-629-838-081-152; 127-897-511-356-645; 158-836-802-771-393; 161-442-910-190-947; 164-022-120-676-705; 169-269-915-774-719; 180-370-935-124-873,0

A total of 2,406 articles were analyzed to examine the relationships between Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and Web of Science citations. The AAS for an article, provided by Altmetric aggregates activities surrounding research outputs in social media (news outlet mentions, tweets, blogs, Wikipedia, etc.). Spearman correlation testing was done on all articles and articles with AAS. Further analysis compared the stratified datasets based on percentile ranks of AAS: top 50%, top 25%, top 10%, and top 1%. Comparisons across the six journals provided additional insights. The results show significant positive correlations between AAS and citations with varied strength for all articles and articles with AAS (or social media mentions), as well as for normalized AAS in the top 50%, top 25%, top 10%, and top 1% datasets. Four of the six PLOS journals, Genetics, Pathogens, Computational Biology, and Neglected Tropical Diseases, show significant positive correlations across all datasets. However, for the two journals with high impact factors, PLOS Biology and Medicine, the results are unexpected: the Medicine articles showed no significant correlations but the Biology articles tested positive for correlations with the whole dataset and the set with AAS. Both journals published substantially fewer articles than the other four journals.

In fact, during the last several decades, a great number of astronomical observatories have been built by space research institutions devoted to space research, turning Chile into one of the countries with the greatest astronomical observation capacity in the world. Consequently, it is relevant to explore and assess the development of astronomy in Chile during the last ten years (2005-2015), carrying out a bibliometric analysis to extract traditional metrics, complemented with alternative metrics, to identify the Chilean production and scientific contribution of research in this field of knowledge. The results from traditional metrics, based on the information obtained in the Web of Science (WoS) database analyzed through InCites for the Astronomy & Astrophysics category indicate a sustained increase of the scientific production for the discipline during the last ten years. In particular, the Normalized Citation Impact of organizations and institutions conducting research in Chile is above the worldwide average. On the other hand, the alternative metrics, including for instance, the altmetrics types presented by the SCOPUS database, reflect that the Chilean research impact is much lower in the context of social networks.",186,,,https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2018/21/epjconf_lisaviii2018_05002/epjconf_lisaviii2018_05002.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/201818605002,0,,10.1051/epjconf/201818605002,2886159578,,013-848-964-561-065; 118-555-050-026-099,0

By correlating traditional and alternative metrics, we attempted to verify whether publications by the SIMPAR group collectively had more impact than those performed by its individual members, either in solo publications or in publications coauthored by non-SIMPAR group investigators (which for the purpose of this study we will refer to as ""individual publications""). For all the 12 members of the group analyzed (pain therapists, biologists, and pharmacologists), we created Open Researcher and Contributor ID and Impact Story accounts, and synchronized these data. Manually, we calculated the level metrics for each article by dividing the data obtained from the research community by those obtained from the public community. We analyzed 759 articles, 18 of which were published by the SIMPAR group. Altmetrics demonstrated that SIMPAR group publications were more likely to be saved (77.8% vs 45.9%), discussed (61.1% vs 1.1%, P<0.0001), and publicly viewed (11.1% vs 1.3%, P=0.05) than individual publications. These results support the importance of multidisciplinary research groups in the impact of scientific literature; the interaction and synergy among the research participants allowed the obtainment of high impact-literature in the field of personalized pain medicine.

A needs assessment survey was conducted to evaluate faculty members’ research support needs and allow a more targeted approach to the development of research services in an academic health sciences library. Methods: The anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to full-time researchers at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto. The survey included twenty questions inquiring about researchers’ needs and behaviors across three stages of the research cycle: funding and grant applications, publication and dissemination, and research impact assessment. Data were also collected on researchers’ use of grey literature to identify whether current library efforts to support researchers should be improved in this area. Results: Among library services, researchers considered support for funding and grant applications most valuable and grey literature support least valuable. Researcher engagement with open access publishing models was low, and few participants had self-archived their publications in the university’s institutional repository. Participants reported low interest in altmetrics, and few used online tools to promote or share their research results. Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased efforts should be made to promote and develop services for funding and grant applications. New services are needed to assist researchers in maximizing their research impact and to increase researcher awareness of the benefits of open access publishing models, self-archiving, and altmetrics.",107,Dental Research/organization & administration; Humans; Information Services/organization & administration; Librarians; Library Services/organization & administration; Needs Assessment; Professional Role; Surveys and Questionnaires,,http://jmla.mlanet.org/ojs/jmla/article/view/556/865 http://jmla.pitt.edu/ojs/jmla/article/view/556,http://dx.doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2019.556,0,31258441,10.5195/jmla.2019.556,2954368183,,,0

Spezi; Simon Wakeling; Stephen Pinfield; Jenny Fry; Claire Creaser; Peter Willett,"Purpose: The aim of this research is to better understand the theory and practice of peer review in open-access mega-journals (OAMJs). Mega-journals typically operate a “soundness only” review policy aiming to evaluate only the rigour of an article, not the novelty or significance of the research or its relevance to a particular community, with these elements being left for “the community to decide” post-publication. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports the results of interviews with 31 senior publishers and editors representing 16 different organisations, including 10 that publish an OAMJ. Thematic Analysis was carried out on the data and an analytical model developed to explicate their significance. Findings: Findings suggest that in reality criteria beyond technical or scientific soundness can and do influence editorial decisions. Deviations from the original OAMJ model are both publisher-supported (in the form of requirements for an article to be ‘worthy’ of publication) and practice-driven (in the form of some reviewers and editors applying traditional peer review criteria to mega-journal submissions). Also publishers believe post-publication evaluation of novelty, significance, and relevance remains problematic. Originality/value: The study is based on unprecedented access to senior publishers and editors, allowing insight into their strategic and operational priorities. The paper is the first to report in-depth qualitative data relating specifically to soundness-only peer review for OAMJs, shedding new light on the mega-journal phenomenon, and helping inform discussion on its future role in scholarly communication. The paper proposes a new model for understanding the mega-journal approach to quality assurance, and how it is different from traditional peer review.",74,,,https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/26343/4/JD-06-2017-0092.pdf https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JD-06-2017-0092/full/html http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/121053/ https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JD-06-2017-0092 https://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/en/publications/let-the-community-decide-the-vision-and-reality-of-soundness-only https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/_Let_the_community_decide_The_vision_and_reality_of_soundness-only_peer_review_in_open-access_mega-journals/9331847 https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-06-2017-0092 https://apo.org.au/node/132311 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/96893421.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/jd-06-2017-0092,0,,10.1108/jd-06-2017-0092,2760508073,,009-625-019-533-665; 016-137-242-927-991; 019-436-189-761-222; 020-766-706-371-44X; 021-121-358-898-082; 021-734-102-987-083; 024-536-027-293-832; 024-755-452-783-605; 034-455-778-858-230; 037-057-663-685-793; 037-550-015-414-716; 042-723-132-313-280; 061-383-015-921-392; 066-507-313-507-599; 073-853-932-812-053; 093-644-492-426-072; 098-013-547-065-819; 101-253-672-783-544; 107-035-170-499-132; 108-649-558-402-379; 114-077-314-057-560; 124-709-685-964-94X; 125-621-031-506-093; 126-682-168-202-643; 127-636-315-567-474; 131-842-341-877-961; 133-688-589-484-897; 136-972-786-666-929; 137-049-411-575-542; 150-070-576-398-617; 168-149-119-095-923,8

Altmetrics are non-traditional measures of impact which are composite scores that include social media and traditional media sharing of an article.; ; Objective; To assess whether a correlation exists between newsworthiness (Altmetric score) and the scientific impact markers such as citation analysis, impact factors and levels of evidence.; ; Materials and Methods; The top 5 most cited articles for the year 2014 and 2015 from the top 10 ranking urology journals (scientific impact group) were identified. The top 50 articles each in 2014 and 2015 were identified from Altmetric support based on media activity (media impact group). We determined the number of citations that these articles received in the scientific literature, and calculated correlations between citations with Altmetric scores.; ; Results; In the scientific impact group, the mean number of citations per article was 37.6, and the most highly cited articles were oncology guidelines. The mean Altmetric score in these articles was 14.8, There was a weak positive correlation between citations and Altmetric score (rs = 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.52, p<0.001). In the media impact group, the mean Altmetric score was 121.1 and most widely shared articles all related to sexual medicine. In this group, the mean number of citations was 9.7 and there was a weak negative correlation between Altmetric score and citations (rs = -0.20, p = 0.046).; ; Conclusion; The top articles based on Altmetric scores were not highly cited, suggesting that publications receiving the most media attention may not be the most scientifically rigorous, or that this audience places greater value on different subjects than the scientific community.; ; This article is protected by copyright.

Riesel; Sarah L M Greenberg; Hampus Holmer; John G. Meara,"INTRODUCTION: The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) aims to address the critical need for surgical care worldwide. To galvanize the global health community, engage key stakeholders, build an inclusive movement, and strengthen the content and impact of the commission, LCoGS launched a Social Media (SM) campaign. This is the first SM Campaign of any Lancet Commission. METHODS: LCoGS Twitter and Facebook accounts were launched in December 2013. Information about LCoGS, live updates from the first commission meeting (LCoGS1), current global surgery updates, and audience-generated feedback were posted. SM analytic tools were used to assess the reach of the SM campaign. RESULTS: In 82 days, 470 Twitter followers from 37 countries and 6 continents and 188 Facebook fans from 32 countries were amassed. The majority of SM engagements were from high-income countries and mirror global use of SM. The LCoGS's launching publication reached over 180,000 people on Twitter. Among over 1.7million scientific articles tracked by a tool called Altmetric, the launching publication is in the top 5% of all articles discussed on Twitter. During LCoGS1, we received over 1000 replies to SM posts. Several novel ideas from these interactions have strengthened the commission process. CONCLUSIONS: SM enables a global, multidirectional engagement that can fortify academic pursuits. Engagement is largely seated in high-income countries. Analytic tools can be used to understand the demographic reach of SM campaigns. Although we can investigate the reach of the LCoGS SM efforts, we cannot determine the impact of that reach.",219,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/83760601 https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/f656a972-64f5-45cf-b1af-015024b27829 https://www.journalacs.org/article/S1072-7515(14)00675-9/fulltext,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.07.139,0,,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.07.139,2312965975,,,1

The objectives of this study were to trace the media coverage of a mathematical modelling study by Punyacharoensin, et al, which estimates the effect of potential prevention programmes on HIV incidence among MSM in the UK and to explore the public perceptions through analysis of their online comments. Methods Articles published prior to 7th March 2016 were included, and were identified using Altmetric software and through online searches. 16 news outlets were identified, with 19 published articles in total. Thematic analysis of the comments was conducted. Results 119 comments left in response to 3 online articles were analysed. 19% of comments (n=23) were “positive” towards the use of PrEP, 52% (n=62) were “negative” and 29% (n=34) were “neutral” or included both “positive” and “negative” themes. The content of the online public discourse can be summarised into four main themes: “costs of PrEP,” “othering,” “framing of condom non-use” and “encouragement of risky behaviours.” Discussion This study is the first of its kind to investigate public reactions to use of PrEP use by MSM in the UK through online platforms and social media. Results allow the exploration of common views and misconceptions among the public. This has implications for the development of social norms and helps to guide the approach required in policy and practice in order promote a more receptive public atmosphere towards PrEP use among MSM in the UK.",93,,,https://sti.bmj.com/content/93/Suppl_1/A36.3 https://sti.bmj.com/content/sextrans/93/Suppl_1/A36.3.full.pdf,https://sti.bmj.com/content/93/Suppl_1/A36.3,0,,,2736283251,,,0

The observed heterogeneity in bibliometric knowledge inspired us to define the concept of ‘metric-wiseness’ for researchers. Being metric-wise can lead to an advantage for knowledgeable researchers over uninformed colleagues, even when they are of otherwise equal competence. We identify two paths through which metric-wiseness can play a role and lead to behavioural changes in the research process. As a first path, metric-wiseness can be seen as an additional tool that is useful in reporting one’s research portfolio. A second one is more ambiguous and has some undesirable aspects, possibly diminishing intrinsic motivational factors for doing research. Innovation and innovative research slows down if crowding out happens due to an excessive attention to scientometric indicators.

An important source of altmetrics is Twitter, which is a popular microblogging service. In bibliometrics, it is standard to normalize citations for cross-field comparisons. This study deals with the normalization of Twitter counts (TC). The problem with Twitter data is that many papers receive zero tweets or only one tweet. In order to restrict the impact analysis on only those journals producing a considerable Twitter impact, we defined the Twitter Index (TI) containing journals with at least 80 % of the papers with at least 1 tweet each. For all papers in each TI journal, we calculated normalized Twitter percentiles (TP) which range from 0 (no impact) to 100 (highest impact). Thus, the highest impact accounts for the paper with the most tweets compared to the other papers in the journal. TP are proposed to be used for cross-field comparisons. We studied the field-independency of TP in comparison with TC. The results point out that the TP can validly be used particularly in biomedical and health sciences, life and earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, as well as physical sciences and engineering. In a first application of TP, we calculated percentiles for countries. The results show that Denmark, Finland, and Norway are the countries with the most tweeted papers (measured by TP).",107,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/149982157 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v107y2016i3d10.1007_s11192-016-1893-6.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-016-1893-6 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27239079 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2944253 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11192-016-1893-6.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1893-6 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4865526 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81731936.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-016-1893-6,0,27239079,10.1007/s11192-016-1893-6,2292601727,PMC4865526,002-025-777-350-346; 006-709-249-955-985; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-784-377-734-821; 009-971-817-581-962; 013-261-296-086-031; 016-715-045-833-488; 021-120-673-715-990; 029-355-017-587-780; 033-729-253-913-937; 035-678-282-600-695; 037-326-531-131-863; 037-331-683-577-73X; 040-160-721-123-582; 041-313-129-519-079; 042-960-490-465-267; 043-618-943-962-438; 045-572-810-412-389; 049-416-575-390-503; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-222-532-022-222; 072-463-767-991-704; 073-628-617-778-798; 099-816-321-816-355; 101-756-965-887-093; 102-276-478-923-871; 122-229-660-040-032; 122-353-860-287-425; 130-446-333-613-121; 141-725-623-570-482; 150-070-576-398-617; 157-508-387-389-306; 175-596-697-216-633; 179-223-065-594-04X; 182-092-180-263-861,25

However, the Internet has radically changed the speed, flow, and sharing of medical information. Furthermore, the explosion of social media, along with development of popular professional and scientific websites and blogs, has led to the need for alternative metrics, known as altmetrics, to quantify the wider impact of research. We explore the evolution of current research impact metrics and examine the evolving role of altmetrics in measuring the wider impact of research. We suggest that altmetrics used in research evaluation should be part of an informed peer-review process such as traditional metrics. Moreover, results based on altmetrics must not lead to direct decision making about research, but instead, should be used to assist experts in making decisions. Finally, traditional and alternative metrics should complement, not replace, each other in the peer-review process.",30,Bibliometrics; Journal Impact Factor; Research,,http://pubmed.cn/28338492 http://journals.lww.com/jspinaldisorders/Fulltext/10.1097/BSD.0000000000000531 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28338492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/bsd.0000000000000531,0,28338492,10.1097/bsd.0000000000000531,2740434670,,001-311-234-725-616; 015-828-855-411-513; 016-715-045-833-488; 046-850-691-447-936; 051-472-143-393-282; 053-086-790-955-429; 057-286-311-076-534; 072-463-767-991-704; 099-816-321-816-355; 130-446-333-613-121; 139-651-430-124-012,13

Spezi; Simon Wakeling; Stephen Pinfield; Claire Creaser; Jenny Fry; Peter Willett,"Purpose; ; ; ; ; Open-access mega-journals (OAMJs) represent an increasingly important part of the scholarly communication landscape. OAMJs, such as PLOS ONE, are large scale, broad scope journals that operate an open access business model (normally based on article-processing charges), and which employ a novel form of peer review, focussing on scientific “soundness” and eschewing judgement of novelty or importance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the discourses relating to OAMJs, and their place within scholarly publishing, and considers attitudes towards mega-journals within the academic community.; ; ; ; ; Design/methodology/approach; ; ; ; ; This paper presents a review of the literature of OAMJs structured around four defining characteristics: scale, disciplinary scope, peer review policy, and economic model. The existing scholarly literature was augmented by searches of more informal outputs, such as blogs and e-mail discussion lists, to capture the debate in its entirety.; ; ; ; ; Findings; ; ; ; ; While the academic literature relating specifically to OAMJs is relatively sparse, discussion in other fora is detailed and animated, with debates ranging from the sustainability and ethics of the mega-journal model, to the impact of soundness-only peer review on article quality and discoverability, and the potential for OAMJs to represent a paradigm-shifting development in scholarly publishing.; ; ; ; ; Originality/value; ; ; ; ; This paper represents the first comprehensive review of the mega-journal phenomenon, drawing not only on the published academic literature, but also grey, professional and informal sources.

Here we utilize the same tools used to study latent traits like Intelligence and Personality to get a quantitative understanding of what over 20 common research metrics indicate about the papers they represent. The sample is all of the 32,962 papers PLoS published in 2014, with results suggesting that there are at least two important underlying factors, which could generally be described as Scientific Attention/Discussion (citations), General Attention/Discussion (views, tweets), and potentially Media Attention/Discussion (media mentions). The General Attention metric is correlated about .50 with both the Academic and Media factors, though the Academic and Media attention are only correlated with each other below .05. The overall best indicator of the dataset was the total lifetime views on the paper, which is also probably the easiest to game. The results indicate the need for funding bodies to decide what they value and how to measure it (e.g., types of attention, quality).",111,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/143366481 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2246-9 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v111y2017i1d10.1007_s11192-017-2246-9.html https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3069828 https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/79196,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2246-9,0,,10.1007/s11192-017-2246-9,2584725018,,007-781-992-937-68X; 011-572-060-332-246; 020-647-409-662-919; 021-120-673-715-990; 022-947-705-794-155; 024-617-732-851-160; 029-500-644-026-171; 030-945-286-798-135; 037-331-683-577-73X; 039-274-388-051-318; 041-049-773-563-310; 041-335-239-436-968; 043-005-424-561-702; 046-406-093-355-678; 047-446-350-836-361; 053-767-883-175-29X; 055-808-236-401-052; 056-593-281-338-022; 057-286-311-076-534; 058-325-345-683-303; 066-507-313-507-599; 069-155-427-145-891; 071-814-237-362-770; 082-168-768-985-438; 093-779-978-973-429; 101-752-490-869-458; 113-700-859-391-863; 119-170-863-920-636; 127-458-994-664-604; 128-978-169-415-312; 141-134-741-084-026; 150-609-967-513-391; 160-462-293-223-417; 170-336-013-910-948; 172-825-135-717-812; 190-720-024-851-922; 191-218-331-958-589,3

Morgan and Claypool, London, 2017b) proposed a new family of field- and time-normalized indicators, which is intended for sparse data. These indicators are based on units of analysis (e.g., institutions) rather than on the paper level. They compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g., on Twitter) of a unit with the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields and publication years. We propose a new indicator (Mantel–Haenszel quotient, MHq) for the indicator family. The MHq is rooted in the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) analysis. This analysis is an established method, which can be used to pool the data from several 2 × 2 cross tables based on different subgroups. We investigate using citations and assessments by peers whether the indicator family can distinguish between quality levels defined by the assessments of peers. Thus, we test the convergent validity. We find that the MHq is able to distinguish between quality levels in most cases while other indicators of the family are not. Since our study approves the MHq as a convergent valid indicator, we apply the MHq to four different Twitter groups as defined by the company Altmetric. Our results show that there is a weak relationship between the Twitter counts of all four Twitter groups and scientific quality, much weaker than between citations and scientific quality. Therefore, our results discourage the use of Twitter counts in research evaluation.",116,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11192-018-2771-1.pdf https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2771-1 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2771-1 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v116y2018i2d10.1007_s11192-018-2771-1.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2771-1,0,30147201,10.1007/s11192-018-2771-1,2800179176,,005-262-664-660-602; 008-729-374-381-619; 009-971-817-581-962; 019-161-426-176-781; 020-122-240-726-734; 024-704-447-017-762; 024-841-048-708-014; 025-484-998-568-67X; 026-365-650-771-727; 030-119-363-887-39X; 030-964-160-765-008; 035-144-028-934-431; 037-306-820-743-518; 038-089-570-409-258; 039-090-602-197-064; 039-570-453-739-175; 040-160-721-123-582; 053-086-790-955-429; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-808-236-401-052; 055-831-901-562-709; 058-914-133-640-307; 067-227-549-025-924; 068-417-475-849-819; 072-219-219-275-120; 073-474-712-890-703; 073-916-406-447-098; 075-751-303-826-167; 085-573-871-761-262; 095-661-194-276-886; 098-446-719-249-299; 100-720-001-794-350; 103-455-013-608-951; 106-598-824-898-46X; 108-182-661-418-479; 109-857-753-937-128; 121-182-804-437-943; 130-623-328-861-459; 140-256-665-222-712; 150-070-576-398-617; 161-092-247-791-596; 174-306-294-696-455,5

We aimed to identify what is known about methods for assessing researcher achievements, leading to a new composite assessment model. Design We systematically reviewed the literature via the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols framework. Data sources All Web of Science databases (including Core Collection, MEDLINE and BIOSIS Citation Index) to the end of 2017. Eligibility criteria (1) English language, (2) published in the last 10 years (2007–2017), (3) full text was available and (4) the article discussed an approach to the assessment of an individual researcher’s achievements. Data extraction and synthesis Articles were allocated among four pairs of reviewers for screening, with each pair randomly assigned 5% of their allocation to review concurrently against inclusion criteria. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa (ĸ). The ĸ statistic showed agreement ranging from moderate to almost perfect (0.4848–0.9039). Following screening, selected articles underwent full-text review and bias was assessed. Results Four hundred and seventy-eight articles were included in the final review. Established approaches developed prior to our inclusion period (eg, citations and outputs, h-index and journal impact factor) remained dominant in the literature and in practice. New bibliometric methods and models emerged in the last 10 years including: measures based on PageRank algorithms or ‘altmetric’ data, methods to apply peer judgement and techniques to assign values to publication quantity and quality. Each assessment method tended to prioritise certain aspects of achievement over others. Conclusions All metrics and models focus on an element or elements at the expense of others. A new composite design, the Comprehensive Researcher Achievement Model (CRAM), is presented, which supersedes past anachronistic models. The CRAM is modifiable to a range of applications.",9,,,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/3/e025320 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/3/e025320.full.pdf https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/the-comprehensive-researcher-achievement-model-cram-a-framework-f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025320,0,30928941,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025320,2933830696,,000-037-660-602-795; 000-792-009-951-071; 001-366-815-878-168; 002-201-302-175-29X; 002-474-078-585-721; 004-575-942-302-380; 006-368-481-793-148; 008-491-633-907-578; 009-659-983-717-574; 010-168-316-482-221; 011-587-229-444-561; 011-775-157-588-299; 011-936-049-670-265; 012-068-587-795-195; 012-092-704-352-271; 012-717-760-048-191; 013-261-296-086-031; 013-514-529-941-389; 014-140-509-649-551; 015-397-978-555-021; 016-552-102-968-773; 016-638-088-420-02X; 016-765-975-190-736; 017-442-186-080-120; 017-749-398-961-962; 018-845-572-498-309; 020-176-962-705-293; 021-193-740-707-331; 022-206-110-985-43X; 022-970-333-981-149; 024-063-292-435-128; 024-240-864-664-212; 024-534-160-397-535; 024-745-715-578-891; 025-393-767-765-250; 025-470-212-568-17X; 026-768-982-725-272; 027-877-338-955-914; 028-079-374-856-956; 028-229-305-820-504; 028-854-564-228-832; 030-485-635-683-148; 031-056-855-501-837; 031-601-481-266-078; 031-703-190-332-191; 032-344-326-987-491; 033-167-527-356-487; 033-909-908-373-942; 034-918-096-765-537; 035-784-414-732-681; 036-892-793-607-630; 037-046-472-665-323; 037-983-701-814-799; 038-264-066-505-537; 039-546-554-428-093; 039-860-740-973-541; 039-944-755-689-269; 039-965-087-746-741; 041-900-033-661-325; 042-634-299-755-764; 043-578-239-094-493; 043-887-125-587-563; 044-615-951-990-415; 046-718-473-240-488; 047-436-441-352-101; 048-735-117-378-146; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-456-744-542-247; 051-642-665-737-651; 055-175-807-806-719; 055-497-099-256-606; 055-837-895-741-205; 061-451-759-153-519; 061-770-543-865-38X; 063-068-029-636-034; 063-111-731-034-78X; 063-249-197-576-117; 063-750-239-446-388; 064-303-248-994-003; 066-102-308-078-931; 067-605-133-989-370; 068-716-891-373-661; 072-120-824-783-617; 072-516-841-671-300; 072-534-743-432-25X; 073-285-680-511-891; 073-777-167-119-224; 074-193-002-335-698; 076-390-069-512-244; 076-677-686-538-720; 076-980-334-785-447; 077-695-915-059-789; 081-590-600-655-395; 082-145-825-312-036; 082-255-673-694-609; 082-291-026-536-872; 083-595-537-541-189; 084-878-522-922-110; 085-703-810-310-946; 089-914-448-038-331; 092-091-143-520-489; 092-334-962-912-64X; 093-084-464-835-204; 093-435-330-781-724; 093-504-933-943-784; 094-843-686-707-380; 096-661-198-568-452; 098-135-092-299-488; 098-231-900-705-780; 099-761-270-679-972; 101-523-144-036-614; 101-752-490-869-458; 102-138-525-337-31X; 102-973-599-213-44X; 104-028-551-416-519; 107-262-715-167-286; 107-317-196-534-35X; 108-124-485-507-775; 111-365-085-473-217; 111-956-114-890-621; 112-940-088-541-54X; 113-603-594-137-653; 116-977-060-898-912; 119-175-332-937-108; 122-813-555-109-002; 123-674-759-889-61X; 130-623-328-861-459; 131-476-671-673-77X; 139-916-768-435-644; 143-470-152-235-282; 153-271-971-583-118; 159-843-129-711-033; 162-804-954-043-115; 165-385-481-718-260; 172-330-388-966-29X; 174-584-882-324-826,1

First, the altruism of scientists is worth more to Bernard than the self-indulgence of mid-nineteenth century Parisian art scene. Second, and we will keep this one in mind, creativity and insights come from individuals, but validation and rigour are reached through collective eoorts, cross-validation, and peerage. Given enough time, the conclusions reached and validated by the eoorts of many will take prominence over individualities, and this (as far as Bernard is concerned), is what science is about. With the technology available to a modern scientist, one should expect that the dissolution of me would be accelerated, and that several scientists should be able to cast a critical eye on data, and use this collective eoort to draw robust conclusions.",6,,,https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/IEE/article/download/4632/4992 https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/IEE/article/view/4632 https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/moving-toward-a-sustainable-ecological-science-dont-let-data-go-t https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19767351.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.4033/iee.2013.6b.14.f,0,,10.4033/iee.2013.6b.14.f,2148916226,,000-164-786-244-059; 001-570-631-760-067; 007-293-938-830-344; 007-743-517-128-157; 011-688-800-338-964; 018-660-183-258-650; 023-771-616-679-454; 029-176-812-465-092; 036-059-038-174-747; 037-792-342-763-237; 041-404-724-306-573; 041-673-079-325-768; 050-240-418-436-992; 051-380-901-650-500; 051-536-521-831-498; 051-965-959-247-371; 054-100-737-918-519; 054-197-324-332-783; 058-017-521-666-98X; 060-747-563-467-504; 061-701-024-911-138; 063-271-413-979-641; 071-321-301-725-009; 074-614-949-934-346; 076-290-872-853-568; 196-524-745-921-468,21

Hartings,"Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.",13,Bibliometrics; Chemistry; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Perception; Publishing/statistics & numerical data; Research Personnel,,https://paperity.org/p/85862824/perception-of-the-importance-of-chemistry-research-papers-and-comparison-to-citation https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903&type=printable http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194903 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194903,0,29590216,10.1371/journal.pone.0194903,2795103092,,001-932-529-223-295; 003-106-377-991-903; 010-057-293-861-47X; 022-040-561-423-332; 031-880-821-544-834; 035-380-078-091-422; 047-057-438-716-71X; 050-886-092-294-893; 053-086-790-955-429; 056-426-226-149-95X; 056-593-281-338-022; 056-648-762-772-730; 064-377-393-918-084; 064-875-511-486-609; 076-868-616-615-243; 097-522-937-851-021; 105-062-194-419-476; 121-011-195-507-937; 123-952-617-726-695; 137-216-379-806-528; 141-134-741-084-026; 174-777-347-890-069,3

Peoples; Stephen R. Midway; Dana K. Sackett; Abigail J. Lynch; Patrick B. Cooney,"The relationship between traditional metrics of research impact (e.g., number of citations) and alternative metrics (altmetrics) such as Twitter activity are of great interest, but remain imprecisely quantified. We used generalized linear mixed modeling to estimate the relative effects of Twitter activity, journal impact factor, and time since publication on Web of Science citation rates of 1,599 primary research articles from 20 ecology journals published from 2012–2014. We found a strong positive relationship between Twitter activity (i.e., the number of unique tweets about an article) and number of citations. Twitter activity was a more important predictor of citation rates than 5-year journal impact factor. Moreover, Twitter activity was not driven by journal impact factor; the ‘highest-impact’ journals were not necessarily the most discussed online. The effect of Twitter activity was only about a fifth as strong as time since publication; accounting for this confounding factor was critical for estimating the true effects of Twitter use. Articles in impactful journals can become heavily cited, but articles in journals with lower impact factors can generate considerable Twitter activity and also become heavily cited.

Methods We assessed dementia biomarker studies included in a previous systematic review in terms of methodological and reporting quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) and Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD), respectively. We extracted additional study and journal-related data from each publication to account for factors shown to be associated with impact in previous research. We explored associations between potential determinants and measures of publication impact in univariable and stepwise multivariable linear regression analyses. Outcome measures We aimed to collect data on four measures of publication impact: two traditional measures—average number of citations per year and 5-year impact factor of the publishing journal and two alternative measures—the Altmetric Attention Score and counts of electronic downloads. Results The systematic review included 142 studies. Due to limited data, Altmetric Attention Scores and electronic downloads were excluded from the analysis, leaving traditional metrics as the only analysed outcome measures. We found no relationship between QUADAS and traditional metrics. Citation rates were independently associated with 5-year journal impact factor (β=0.42; p Conclusions Citation rates and 5-year journal impact factor appear to measure different dimensions of impact. Citation rates were weakly associated with completeness of reporting, while neither traditional metric was related to methodological rigour.

Altmetric and other measurements stratify academic communications according to this alternate, online media presence (not academic penetrance).

Hoang; Jonathan McCall; Andrew Dixon; Ryan T. Fitzgerald; Frank Gaillard,"Abstract Purpose The aim of this study was to compare the volume of individuals who viewed online versions of research articles in 2 peer-reviewed radiology journals and a radiology blog promoted by social media. Methods The authors performed a retrospective study comparing online analytic logs of research articles in the American Journal of Neuroradiology ( AJNR ) and the American Journal of Roentgenology ( AJR ) and a blog posting on Radiopaedia.org from April 2013 to September 2014. All 3 articles addressed the topic of reporting incidental thyroid nodules detected on CT and MRI. The total page views for the research articles and the blog article were compared, and trends in page views were observed. Factors potentially affecting trends were an AJNR podcast and promotion of the blog article on the social media platforms Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter to followers of Radiopaedia.org in February 2014 and August 2014. Results The total numbers of page views during the study period were 2,421 for the AJNR article and 3,064 for the AJR article. The Radiopaedia.org blog received 32,675 page views, which was 13.6 and 10.7 times greater than AJNR and AJR page views, respectively, and 6.0 times greater than both journal articles combined. Months with activity above average for the blog and the AJNR article coincided with promotion by Radiopaedia.org on social media. Conclusions Dissemination of scientific material on a radiology blog promoted on social media can substantially augment the reach of more traditional publication venues. Although peer-reviewed publication remains the most widely accepted measure of academic productivity, researchers in radiology should not ignore opportunities for increasing the impact of research findings via social media.",12,"Humans; Information Dissemination; Peer Review, Research; Periodicals as Topic/statistics & numerical data; Radiology; Research; Retrospective Studies; Social Media/statistics & numerical data",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959491 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144015002112 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144015002112 http://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(15)00211-2/references,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2015.03.048,0,25959491,10.1016/j.jacr.2015.03.048,1576940119,,005-520-537-260-373; 010-537-281-905-239; 011-210-804-078-212; 020-448-820-329-778; 034-140-696-578-757; 039-436-435-369-054; 041-652-566-763-463; 043-693-475-387-97X; 048-045-413-653-976; 050-252-270-491-60X; 052-129-828-982-897; 062-207-338-529-348; 066-438-980-246-269; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-249-419-151-233; 071-123-245-005-332; 086-156-506-506-799; 089-459-322-226-132; 097-834-013-767-957; 120-869-060-973-296; 122-353-860-287-425; 137-126-628-585-297,39

In order to do so, we explored the identities, characteristics and activities of South African science tweeters (or ZA science tweeters)—i.e. Twitter users in South Africa who tweet about research articles. The growing number of ZA science tweeters, both overall and in relative terms, suggests that Twitter users are increasingly using this social media platform as a tool to share and discuss scientific outputs. ZA science tweeters are actively contributing to the sharing of information about new research articles, but, in line with global trends, the bulk of science tweets amongst South African Twitter users comes from a small number of active tweeters, and only 1% of ZA science tweeters had more than 20,000 followers. About 6.6% of ZA science tweeters are scholars (or researchers) themselves. Compared to science tweeters who are not scholars, the scholar-tweeters sent out tweets about research articles more frequently, are active on Twitter over longer periods of time, publish more original tweets and use hashtags more frequently to increase their engagement on Twitter. In their Twitter bios, these scholars typically use academic terms to describe themselves, thereby presenting themselves as experts on this social media platform. Astronomy, astrophysics, ecology and the environment emerge as the research topics that are most popular amongst ZA science tweeters.",2,,,https://www.journalofaltmetrics.org/article/10.29024/joa.8/ https://www.doi.org/10.29024/joa.8,http://dx.doi.org/10.29024/joa.8,0,,10.29024/joa.8,2946563140,,000-072-455-561-916; 001-731-506-576-898; 002-052-422-936-00X; 002-052-969-022-906; 007-866-644-372-347; 011-859-263-123-186; 012-523-852-839-585; 020-608-633-882-906; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-052-027-802-221; 033-206-089-158-382; 037-787-607-399-48X; 038-107-047-654-79X; 040-914-542-149-363; 049-431-116-127-058; 057-736-953-955-026; 080-995-379-308-35X; 084-404-236-036-711; 114-569-399-530-919; 117-074-536-196-553; 131-886-794-598-29X; 142-590-215-847-914; 157-243-995-124-482,1

Although in practice, the basic quality of scientific outputs is evaluated by committees/peers (peer review) who have general knowledge and competencies. However, their assessment might not comprehensively consider different dimensions of the quality of the scientific outputs. Hence, there is a requirement to evaluate scientific outputs based on some other metrics which cover more aspects of quality after publishing, which is the aim of this study. To reach this aim, first different quality metrics are identified through an extensive literature review. Then a recently developed multi-criteria methodology (best worst method) is used to find the importance of each quality metric. Finally, based on the importance of each quality metric and the data which are collected from Scopus, the quality of research papers published by the members of a university faculty is measured. The proposed model in this paper provides the opportunity to measure quality of research papers not only by considering different aspects of quality, but also by considering the importance of each quality metric. The proposed model can be used for assessing other scientific outputs as well.",112,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2284-3 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2284-3 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3107310 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v112y2017i1d10.1007_s11192-017-2284-3.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2284-3.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2284-3 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aopenaccess.leidenuniv.nl%3A1887%2F48100 https://paperity.org/p/79208679/quality-assessment-of-scientific-outputs-using-the-bwm https://core.ac.uk/display/83000027 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81610976.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2284-3,0,28725096,10.1007/s11192-017-2284-3,2588321947,,000-827-073-807-610; 002-666-995-736-984; 003-168-179-893-142; 004-161-047-261-148; 005-657-459-454-849; 005-893-127-733-440; 006-018-730-429-356; 006-526-262-451-560; 007-446-858-302-247; 010-700-113-396-612; 011-917-962-924-268; 013-123-944-981-275; 013-754-928-698-091; 018-521-460-130-605; 026-186-941-343-390; 027-434-527-905-948; 027-558-976-486-19X; 028-800-911-277-740; 029-782-530-458-118; 030-096-877-068-480; 034-605-737-341-631; 036-883-207-978-224; 038-408-776-929-051; 044-438-379-672-699; 044-894-018-787-174; 048-476-957-423-890; 048-960-970-365-95X; 052-548-921-979-744; 057-127-708-118-407; 057-286-311-076-534; 059-676-299-361-653; 061-451-759-153-519; 067-704-690-865-884; 071-878-836-294-733; 080-690-930-533-210; 080-865-225-620-986; 081-831-333-395-625; 085-001-502-383-40X; 085-581-114-337-106; 089-082-440-182-17X; 089-784-200-270-273; 091-396-655-172-810; 092-840-217-204-741; 093-186-636-893-601; 094-085-972-332-890; 099-580-516-512-687; 099-816-321-816-355; 099-938-489-695-249; 102-325-802-031-188; 107-692-105-227-851; 140-698-140-600-993; 141-134-741-084-026; 141-338-037-979-664; 156-246-905-661-24X; 175-284-019-539-449; 195-514-312-394-548,20

Social scholarship is a framework that expanded Boyers' (1990) conceptualization of scholarship to consider how social media affect discovery and research, teaching and learning, integration, and application. This paper critically reflects on how social scholarship continues to evolve in light of changing understandings in the field of educational technology and the role social media play in the academy. We provide recent examples of social scholarship such as altmetrics, interdisciplinary projects, crowdsourced educational technology syllabi and reconsideration of the needs of research participants. Moreover, we share concrete examples of how scholars might enact social scholarship, with what benefits and challenges, and surface new concerns regarding openness, equity, access, literacy, privacy and ethical considerations. Our paper concludes with recommendations for preparing scholars to enact social scholarship while mitigating the challenges it poses.

There are three main actors called to deal with research data publishing practices: researchers, publishers, and data repositories. This study analyses the solutions offered by generalist scientific data repositories, i.e., repositories supporting the deposition of any type of research data. These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such repositories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset formatting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a context where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.",15,,,https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2016-006/ http://microblogging.infodocs.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/585-1650-1-PB.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37824085.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2016-006,0,,10.5334/dsj-2016-006,2345312768,,000-164-786-244-059; 000-785-692-812-344; 001-066-276-734-346; 004-622-904-945-157; 004-669-233-884-485; 007-454-474-945-657; 010-337-958-542-542; 013-385-172-441-438; 017-300-120-483-628; 020-222-508-918-832; 023-982-034-841-976; 029-796-397-622-122; 029-913-785-826-098; 032-013-750-369-418; 032-589-932-822-991; 033-549-431-833-422; 035-706-571-403-247; 036-069-898-162-219; 038-666-824-652-635; 039-705-171-619-023; 039-807-239-025-457; 041-787-381-954-931; 044-182-641-469-690; 044-768-617-399-993; 044-905-724-086-632; 045-248-909-039-102; 045-881-258-811-923; 046-879-732-067-999; 048-256-456-093-964; 048-672-981-439-41X; 051-965-959-247-371; 054-232-712-301-832; 056-253-781-083-379; 060-192-813-815-326; 060-713-609-759-751; 061-901-005-593-089; 062-484-411-946-144; 062-973-684-917-848; 065-876-990-254-223; 066-061-654-989-385; 067-153-526-140-832; 068-413-672-609-576; 069-801-399-246-612; 072-352-880-909-686; 073-451-150-482-326; 075-990-242-762-021; 076-226-715-208-673; 076-602-715-418-116; 076-766-485-903-917; 079-454-391-341-809; 080-934-665-116-667; 081-306-131-270-108; 082-770-706-465-260; 085-428-737-118-953; 086-218-101-768-695; 086-303-943-367-632; 086-333-073-633-286; 087-945-412-235-877; 088-523-864-768-793; 090-110-782-029-918; 090-768-913-164-353; 090-789-130-583-44X; 094-834-168-358-542; 106-461-299-748-086; 106-564-766-663-201; 109-923-380-701-392; 110-457-195-877-695; 111-169-718-728-817; 111-457-658-079-347; 112-255-310-240-348; 112-800-988-699-284; 117-915-641-335-520; 122-109-079-955-187; 128-976-006-412-740; 129-601-735-055-443; 144-732-056-958-441; 146-225-907-635-023; 148-130-639-772-427; 149-592-353-001-259; 150-085-629-478-541; 152-368-873-730-852; 163-427-813-071-222; 166-813-363-913-780; 182-227-850-004-478; 193-584-620-288-019; 194-427-635-021-98X,20

This article aimed to determine the 100 most mentioned articles in the field of neurointervention and to analyze their characteristics. Materials and methods We selected the 808 journals that were considered journals potentially publishing articles on neurointervention. We also selected articles using keywords. Using the Altmetric.com search tool, we identified the 101 most mentioned neurointervention articles based on the highest altmetric attention scores (AASs) within selected journals and articles. Each article was evaluated for several characteristics including AAS, number of citations, journal title, journal category, impact factor of the journal, year of publication, authorship, country, type of document, and topic. Results The AASs for the top 101 articles ranged from 1586 to 39. Stroke published the largest number of articles (19.8%) followed by the New England Journal of Medicine (17.8%). The majority of articles were published in multidisciplinary journals (38.6%), were published in 2017–2018 (43.6%), originated from the USA (54.5%), were original articles (66.3%), and dealt with intra-arterial thrombolysis or thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke (58.4%). Tudor G Jovin was the most prolific author, authoring 18 of the most mentioned neurointervention articles Conclusions This study presents a detailed list of the 101 most mentioned neurointervention articles in online media, thus providing useful information on the dissemination of neurointervention research to the general public.",11,"Bibliometrics; Embolization, Therapeutic; Internet; Journal Impact Factor; Neurosurgery/statistics & numerical data; Neurosurgical Procedures/statistics & numerical data; Periodicals as Topic; Thrombectomy",,https://jnis.bmj.com/content/early/2018/12/20/neurintsurg-2018-014368 https://jnis.bmj.com/content/11/5/528 https://jnis.bmj.com/content/neurintsurg/early/2018/12/20/neurintsurg-2018-014368.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014368,0,30538146,10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014368,2904794364,,005-219-507-701-892; 007-205-762-763-201; 008-448-500-103-417; 018-439-684-800-564; 028-542-346-751-753; 031-177-299-306-256; 035-800-259-148-481; 038-264-066-505-537; 044-710-729-191-829; 045-784-030-723-340; 050-101-745-005-68X; 053-675-116-280-971; 058-238-890-202-143; 059-677-019-059-324; 063-144-189-164-648; 066-507-313-507-599; 070-165-651-115-034; 073-777-167-119-224; 075-445-662-780-564; 094-851-428-549-340; 097-179-911-288-087; 102-973-599-213-44X; 127-458-994-664-604; 133-448-089-635-211; 186-429-639-951-411,2

First, the study aims to investigate the relationship between the altmetric indicators from ResearchGate (RG) and the bibliometric indicators from the Scopus database. Second, the study seeks to examine the relationship amongst the RG altmetric indicators themselves. RG is a rich source of altmetric indicators such as Citations, RGScore, Impact Points, Profile Views, Publication Views, etc. Design/methodology/approach – For establishing whether RG metrics showed the same results as the established sources of metrics, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated between the metrics provided by RG and the metrics obtained from Scopus. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were also calculated for the metrics provided by RG. The data were collected by visiting the profile pages of all the members who had an account in RG under the Department of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh (India).

Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow. Findings: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.",8,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0pk517k2 http://scfbm.org/content/pdf/1751-0473-8-7.pdf https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7 https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pfigshare-u-files/481948/git_manuscript.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81555381 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7 https://scfbm.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7?site=scfbm.biomedcentral.com https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3639880/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3639880 https://scfbm.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81555381.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0473-8-7,0,23448176,10.1186/1751-0473-8-7,2151577432,PMC3639880,006-457-039-206-005; 015-567-817-927-719; 017-384-692-349-599; 019-371-610-969-250; 024-843-151-675-205; 028-725-157-977-122; 032-147-691-379-854; 034-226-623-297-644; 035-494-779-946-046; 043-767-734-196-051; 051-965-959-247-371; 060-747-563-467-504; 062-908-389-914-213; 074-614-949-934-346; 079-821-122-981-092; 084-251-240-437-994; 091-517-271-423-594; 096-430-256-052-959; 100-367-092-811-675; 104-824-879-307-444; 105-744-293-799-951; 112-873-054-773-601; 118-055-657-395-789; 172-916-734-975-892,85

Ezema; Cyprian I. Ugwu,"Since the development of web 2.0, there has been a paradigm shift in methods of knowledge sharing. This has equally impacted on techniques of research evaluation. Many scholars have argued that the social utilization of research is hardly reflected in the traditional methods of research evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to determine the research impact of Library and Information Science (LIS) journals using Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) and then examine whether there is a correlation between their citations and altmetric attentions.,This paper is an attempt to contribute to this discussion with focus on the field of LIS. This paper adopted descriptive informatics to analyze LIS journals. The paper extracted citation data from WoS, Scopus and GS, and altmetric attentions from 85 LIS journals indexed by WoS. Further, 18 journals with high altmetric attention were identified, while 9 of these maintained consistent presence in the three databases used.,Findings show that of these databases, citation data from GS was found to have a high correlation with altmetric attention, while the other two databases maintained moderate correlations with altmetric attention. The paper also found a positive but non-significant correlation between citation scores and altmetric attention in the nine journals that maintained consistent presence in the three databases.,The findings of this paper will be useful to librarians in selection of relevant journals for their libraries and also will assist authors in the choice of publication outlets for their papers particularly when considering journals that have visibility and research impact.,The originality of the paper lies on empirical evidences from the citation and altmetric data extracted from the databases used for the paper.",47,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IDD-08-2018-0029/full/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/idd-08-2018-0029,0,,10.1108/idd-08-2018-0029,2946927235,,003-021-187-267-313; 003-078-576-803-447; 003-168-179-893-142; 003-254-479-923-236; 005-699-111-606-288; 009-607-093-264-281; 010-194-028-604-828; 021-696-172-742-263; 025-042-617-409-74X; 028-903-505-800-665; 029-772-963-484-048; 043-495-392-935-371; 046-261-734-693-737; 047-787-501-272-838; 049-316-012-536-347; 068-340-263-134-747; 072-150-692-543-669; 074-791-922-084-078; 086-003-302-341-673; 092-132-106-998-377; 096-931-343-681-070; 101-752-490-869-458; 110-457-195-877-695; 117-412-485-443-719; 123-687-398-098-005; 153-376-062-165-585; 183-609-188-649-940,0

We show that the classical weighted impact factors are particular cases of our model, but it can also be used for defining new impact measuring tools for other sources of information--as repositories of datasets--providing the mathematical support for a new family of altmetrics. Our aim is to show the main mathematical properties of this class of impact measuring tools, that hold as consequences of their mathematical structure and does not depend on the definition of any given index nowadays in use. In order to show the power of our approach in a well-known setting, we apply our construction to analyze the stability of the ordering induced in a list of journals by the 2-year impact factor ($$\hbox {IF}_2$$IF2). We study the change of this ordering when the criterium to define it is given by the numerical value of a new weighted impact factor, in which $$\hbox {IF}_2$$IF2 is used for defining the weights. We prove that, if we assume that the weight associated to a citing journal increases with its $$\hbox {IF}_2$$IF2, then the ordering given in the list by the new weighted impact factor coincides with the order defined by the $$\hbox {IF}_2$$IF2. We give a quantitative bound for the errors committed.

Participants affirmed the perception that altmetrics can be of value in helping to craft a story of the value of their research and its diverse outputs. When participants had prior knowledge of altmetrics tools, it tended to be very narrow and deep, and perhaps field-specific.

Areas of assistance include: personalized support, establishment of goals, orientation to specific tools, orientation to altmetrics and scholarly promotion landscape, preparing users for potential difficulties, discussing copyright implications, Open Access education, and guidance with packaging content for different venues and audiences.",11,,,https://apo.org.au/node/94731 https://doaj.org/article/394afd16a0614d16ba31cd2b7373e911 https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2017/06/apo-nid94731-1125216.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/b8j047,0,,10.18438/b8j047,2442796381,,002-666-995-736-984; 006-457-411-091-209; 041-970-712-811-974; 101-141-834-699-083; 127-458-994-664-604; 146-733-369-353-088,4

The quality of China’s research is also on the rise (Van Noorden, 2016). But the online visibility and impact of China’s research are also important issues worth exploring. In this study, we investigate the altmetric performance of publications in the field of Biotechnology and Applied Microbiology and published by authors from Chinese affiliations. We find that papers published by those authors from Chinese affiliations have much lower visibility on the social web than articles from other countries. Fewer of China’s publications get tweeted, and those tweeted publications attract less social attention. A geographical analysis of tweeters shows that scholarly articles get most of their social attention from the authors’ home countries, a finding that is also confirmed by correlation and regression analysis. This situation, which is unfavorable for researchers from Chinese affiliations, is caused, in part, by the inaccessibility of mainstream social networking platforms in mainland China.",1,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frma.2016.00008/full https://core.ac.uk/display/82848692 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2016.00008/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2016.00008/pdf http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1610.html#WangFLG16 https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07424 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07424 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82848692.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frma.2016.00008,0,,10.3389/frma.2016.00008,2532519289,,010-474-157-259-115; 010-626-222-726-657; 014-017-993-727-094; 019-007-990-305-286; 033-067-866-990-337; 041-164-211-150-294; 051-965-959-247-371; 053-457-333-495-631; 058-392-118-876-084; 062-501-808-210-460; 075-769-701-871-946; 093-664-234-944-828; 099-816-321-816-355; 109-527-953-385-629; 111-827-993-016-293; 118-003-632-018-181; 121-568-695-886-919; 122-073-156-920-876,6

This study aims to provide clarity on cancer research trends. The amount of research papers pertaining to different types of cancers is compared against mortality and diagnosis rates to determine the amount of research attention given to a type of cancer, in relation to its effects on the general population. Computational tools, such as Python, R, and Microsoft Excel, were used to analyze a dataset of research papers.

Emphasis is placed on the study of impact and visibility, both through bibliometric and altmetric indicators to determine similarities and differences and to establish possible inter-variable relationships. The use of measures such as the presence in social media for the study of the visibility of documents is discussed. A total of 112 300 papers published from 2013 to 2015 in the three disciplines analysed was retrieved from the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). Economics accounted for the largest number and was observed to have a ‘stable’ and consolidated output profile. Collaboration, impact and visibility were found to be inter-related in the three fields. The proportion of papers with mentions in the social media was high (around 50 %) in communication and sociology, suggesting a relationship between the object of study and the medium for disseminating the findings. Tweets were the most common type of mentions. While the correlation between academic impact (citation/doc) and mentions in blog posts and tweets was observed to be low, the percentage of papers cited (78 % to 96 %) and the mean number of citations per paper were greater among those with than those without mentions in the social media (especially those mentioned in Google+, MSM, videos and Wikipedia).

Anderson; Stefan Decker; Conor Hayes; T. Buecheler; Dirk Helbing,"Modern science is a main driver of technological innovation. The efficiency of the scientific system is of key importance to ensure the competitiveness of a nation or region. However, the scientific system that we use today was devised centuries ago and is inadequate for our current ICT-based society: the peer review system encourages conservatism, journal publications are monolithic and slow, data is often not available to other scientists, and the independent validation of results is limited. The resulting scientific process is hence slow and sloppy. Building on the Innovation Accelerator paper by Helbing and Balietti [1], this paper takes the initial global vision and reviews the theoretical and technological building blocks that can be used for implementing an innovation (in first place: science) accelerator platform driven by re-imagining the science system. The envisioned platform would rest on four pillars: (i) Redesign the incentive scheme to reduce behavior such as conservatism, herding and hyping; (ii) Advance scientific publications by breaking up the monolithic paper unit and introducing other building blocks such as data, tools, experiment workflows, resources; (iii) Use machine readable semantics for publications, debate structures, provenance etc. in order to include the computer as a partner in the scientific process, and (iv) Build an online platform for collaboration, including a network of trust and reputation among the different types of stakeholders in the scientific system: scientists, educators, funding agencies, policy makers, students and industrial innovators among others. Any such improvements to the scientific system must support the entire scientific process (unlike current tools that chop up the scientific process into disconnected pieces), must facilitate and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinarity (again unlike current tools), must facilitate the inclusion of intelligent computing in the scientific process, must facilitate not only the core scientific process, but also accommodate other stakeholders such science policy makers, industrial innovators, and the general public. We first describe the current state of the scientific system together with up to a dozen new key initiatives, including an analysis of the role of science as an innovation accelerator. Our brief survey will show that there exist many separate ideas and concepts and diverse stand-alone demonstrator systems for different components of the ecosystem with many parts are still unexplored, and overall integration lacking. By analyzing a matrix of stakeholders vs. functionalities, we identify the required innovations. We (non-exhaustively) discuss a few of them: Publications that are meaningful to machines, innovative reviewing processes, data publication, workflow archiving and reuse, alternative impact metrics, tools for the detection of trends, community formation and emergence, as well as modular publications, citation objects and debate graphs. To summarize, the core idea behind the Innovation Accelerator is to develop new incentive models, rules, and interaction mechanisms to stimulate true innovation, revolutionizing the way in which we create knowledge and disseminate information.",214,,,https://paperity.org/p/30741780/theoretical-and-technological-building-blocks-for-an-innovation-accelerator https://repub.eur.nl/pub/60431 http://www.few.vu.nl/~frankh//postscript/EPJST2012.pdf https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/theoretical-and-technological-building-blocks-for-an-innovation-accelerator(bd044e59-b6c9-4a59-a333-0311ffc1fe15).html http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/15415492/Theoretical_And_Technological_Building_Blocks_For_An_Innovation_Accelerator.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140%2Fepjst%2Fe2012-01692-1.pdf https://128.84.21.199/abs/1210.1480 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F433d785b-5e53-418e-b030-d6052a5f8884 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjst%2Fe2012-01692-1 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.1480 https://epjst.epj.org/articles/epjst/abs/2012/14/epjst214009/epjst214009.html http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1210.html#abs-1210-1480 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjst%2Fe2012-01692-1 https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/theoretical-and-technological-building-blocks-for-an-innovation-a https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1480 https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:192406 http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/49875/EPJST2012.pdf;sequence=1 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81546992.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2012-01692-1,0,,10.1140/epjst/e2012-01692-1,2109035376,,003-402-044-051-493; 003-580-548-827-947; 004-489-738-283-425; 007-035-385-097-135; 008-945-042-508-894; 009-582-421-488-252; 011-307-720-531-674; 016-574-404-432-904; 017-258-267-170-54X; 019-265-590-591-246; 024-364-718-617-375; 024-700-386-539-39X; 025-806-670-032-344; 027-461-471-742-548; 027-578-113-202-727; 030-840-146-519-316; 033-689-196-859-458; 036-629-014-326-410; 037-296-833-894-159; 039-342-775-406-424; 042-354-265-961-248; 043-030-883-254-212; 047-454-608-714-928; 050-553-611-480-757; 054-803-817-223-996; 055-519-339-568-292; 056-619-049-143-418; 058-628-792-902-887; 058-932-403-637-36X; 060-713-609-759-751; 061-865-166-349-495; 064-872-280-799-291; 065-832-661-563-75X; 069-191-299-320-832; 074-522-031-237-995; 076-528-436-032-242; 079-877-967-594-740; 083-118-333-443-649; 084-501-343-788-390; 085-047-801-723-674; 088-614-933-074-976; 089-139-642-815-099; 089-914-448-038-331; 099-816-321-816-355; 102-276-478-923-871; 103-523-407-460-912; 104-889-475-186-487; 104-928-880-313-741; 110-633-070-607-659; 113-393-154-028-848; 117-109-843-318-28X; 117-123-094-935-184; 118-055-657-395-789; 124-437-545-423-037; 127-011-833-785-121; 128-790-275-061-242; 129-199-393-329-05X; 130-646-601-123-994; 130-814-850-496-53X; 134-613-182-292-738; 136-959-920-949-246; 140-204-801-433-174; 141-888-388-291-198; 149-875-580-458-515; 151-931-842-151-181; 157-105-911-131-736; 167-386-676-933-304; 182-587-333-934-318; 185-459-009-314-240; 186-570-040-418-496; 188-008-710-795-149; 194-597-790-129-490,18

Aims (1) Audit the adherence of all published BETs in IJS to these guidelines. (2) Assess the reach and impact of BETs published in IJS. Methods BETs published between 2011 and February 2014 were identified from http://www.journal-surgery.net/. Standards audited included: completeness of description of study attrition, and independent verification of searches. Other extracted data included: relevant subspecialty, duration between searches and publication, and between acceptance and publication. Each BET's number of citations (http://scholar.google.co.uk/), number of tweets (http://www.altmetric.com/) and number of Researchgate views (https://www.researchgate.net/) were recorded. Results Thirty-four BETs were identified: the majority, 19 (56%), relating to upper gastrointestinal surgery and none to cardiothoracic, orthopaedic or paediatric surgery. Twenty-nine BETs (82%) fully described study attrition. Twenty-one (62%) had independently verified search results. The mean times from literature searching to publication and acceptance to publication were 38.5 weeks and 13 days respectively. There were a mean 40 (range 0–89) Researchgate views/article, mean 2 (range 0–7) citations/article and mean 0.36 (range 0–2) tweets/article. Conclusions Adherence to BET guidelines has been variable. Authors are encouraged to adhere to journal guidelines and reviewers and editors to enforce them. BETs have received similar citation levels to other IJS articles. Means of increasing the visibility of published BETs such as social media sharing, conference presentation and deposition of abstracts in public repositories should be explored. More work is required to encourage more submissions from other surgical subspecialties other than gastrointestinal specialties.",17,Clinical Audit; Digestive System Surgical Procedures/standards; Humans; Periodicals as Topic/standards,,https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/publications/675258 https://www.journal-surgery.net/article/S1743-9191(15)00099-0/fulltext http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919115000990 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819136 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919115000990,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.03.014,0,25819136,10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.03.014,2081279783,,002-813-222-729-480; 005-487-478-098-449; 005-902-835-967-805; 006-168-735-298-66X; 006-411-098-129-026; 007-435-045-078-088; 009-450-759-062-596; 009-619-723-915-084; 011-180-055-118-613; 011-245-862-573-449; 015-951-001-936-010; 020-175-670-886-104; 020-799-709-459-763; 021-985-029-765-586; 026-594-413-631-770; 026-867-801-744-620; 028-686-342-756-082; 030-026-601-061-938; 032-721-998-388-433; 036-017-599-660-678; 038-974-995-971-037; 039-333-927-518-608; 041-617-019-200-422; 048-462-996-543-281; 049-686-900-120-516; 053-530-722-975-928; 065-246-166-149-090; 065-634-141-117-484; 070-674-062-991-701; 073-607-989-140-178; 074-572-586-893-609; 086-970-614-165-078; 088-761-732-731-829; 089-709-935-887-450; 091-206-329-445-078; 096-163-106-466-765; 098-764-050-242-979; 128-308-010-252-782; 139-990-083-374-59X; 150-882-553-020-279; 172-243-597-386-43X,2

Chan; Brent Thoma,"Introduction: With the increasing volume of medical literature published each year, it is difficult for clinicians to translate the latest research into practice. Awareness is the first step of knowledge translation and journals have begun using social media to increase the dissemination and awareness of their publications. Infographics can describe research findings visually, are shared broadly on social media, and may be a more effective way to convey information. We hypothesized that infographic abstracts would increase the social media dissemination and online readership of research articles relative to traditional abstracts. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 24 original research articles were chosen from the six issues of the Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine (CJEM) published between July 2016 and May 2017 (4 articles per issue). Half were randomized to the infographic and control groups within each issue. Infographic articles were promoted using a visual infographic outlining the findings of the article. Control articles were promoted using a screen capture image of each articles abstract. Both were disseminated through the journals social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook) along with the link to the selected article. Infographics were also published on CanadiEM.org. Abstract views, full text views, and the change in Altmetric score were tracked for 30 days and compared between groups. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used to detect significant differences. Results: Abstract views (mean, SD) were significantly higher for infographic articles (378.9, 162.0) than control articles (175.5, 69.2, p Conclusion: CJEM articles promoted on social media using infographics had higher abstract viewership and Altmetric scores than those promoted with traditional abstracts. Although there was no difference in full-text readership, our results suggest that infographic abstracts may have a role in increasing the dissemination of medical literature.",20,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-emergency-medicine/article/p072-the-effect-of-infographic-promotion-on-research-dissemination-and-readership-a-randomized-control-trial/2109DD3FF74635DA708ECAFD2EA334A9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cem.2018.270,0,,10.1017/cem.2018.270,2799659072,,,0

The purpose of this study is to report on the e-visibility status phase of a longitudinal e-visibility study (Dec 2014 – April 2017) investigating the e-visibility themes of online presence, researcher discoverability and accessibility of research output of the environmental science researchers at the University of South Africa. Bibliometric and altmetric data were collected via online searches and an online survey was completed by the School of Environmental Sciences during December 2014. The results for online research presence indicate a preference for using free search engines versus fee-based traditional resources. Regarding researcher discoverability via e-profiles, the results indicated a preference for using free websites, with the highest distribution on LinkedIn. A higher distribution of research output on free online resources was reported, with a low percentage of researchers participated in self-archiving on social networking tools, in online archives and in repositories, which resulted in a small percentage of accessible research output online. This research suggests that the development of an e-visibility strategy would support and enable academic e-visibility, therefore increasing online research visibility, discoverability and accessibility of the School of Environmental Sciences researchers at University of South Africa.",83,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.7553/83-2-1636 http://sajlis.journals.ac.za/pub/article/download/1636/1482 http://sajlis.journals.ac.za/pub/article/view/1636 http://dx.doi.org/10.7553/83-2-1636,http://dx.doi.org/10.7553/83-2-1636,0,,10.7553/83-2-1636,2788525074,,,0

King,"In this paper we test whether metrics of online attention describing research can provide information on research quality, and quality of impact from research, that isn?t found in citation data alone. Our approach is to set up a traditional model in which the true quality or impact of a university department is determined by a panel of experts but a citation metric is regarded as a reasonable proxy. However, the model assumes that the information contained in the scores provided by an expert panel exceeds that contained in a citation metric (HEFCE, 2015). Finally, we extend this model by including the altmetric score to see if it adds information about a department?s quality that can?t be gleaned from citations alone. We find the presence of altmetric data for the cited underpinning research to be highly correlated with peer review scores on research impact. Conversely, no effect was seen within the assessment of research quality. Our findings therefore suggest altmetric data could be useful as an aid to assessing impact.

Maturity assessment analyzes how well a technological development can fulfill an expected task. The technology readiness level (TRL) has been considered to be one of the most promising approaches for addressing technological maturity. Nonetheless, its assessment requires opinions of the experts, which is costly and implies the risk of personal bias. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Bibliometric Method for Assessing Technological Maturity (BIMATEM). It is a repeatable framework that assesses maturity quantitatively. Our method is based on the assumption that each technology life cycle stage can be matched to technology records contained in scientific literature, patents, and news databases. The scientific papers and patent records of mature technologies display a logistic growth behavior, while news records follow a hype-type behavior. BIMATEM determines the maturity level by curve fitting technology records to these behaviors. To test our approach, BIMATEM was applied to additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Our results revealed that material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion and vat photopolymerization are the most mature AM technologies with TRL between 6 and 7, followed by directed energy deposition with TRL between 4 and 5, and binder jetting and sheet lamination, the least mature, with TRL between 1 and 2. BIMATEM can be used by competitive technology intelligence professionals, policymakers, and further decision makers whose main interests include assessing the risk of implementing new technologies. Future research can focus on testing the method with regard to altmetrics.",117,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11192-018-2941-1.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-018-2941-1 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2941-1 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v117y2018i3d10.1007_s11192-018-2941-1.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2941-1,0,30546169,10.1007/s11192-018-2941-1,2899270272,,001-317-858-513-504; 002-715-745-296-371; 004-379-227-063-116; 005-877-775-219-212; 012-249-556-309-003; 012-984-736-934-835; 016-455-020-865-012; 017-656-576-444-245; 022-423-606-353-998; 023-481-161-675-434; 024-691-742-137-708; 028-565-008-674-427; 037-331-560-634-140; 040-203-811-669-877; 042-011-144-554-158; 045-892-906-549-366; 051-537-926-980-189; 055-070-550-438-664; 057-958-880-696-687; 061-227-842-772-891; 063-310-578-907-530; 064-676-798-325-340; 065-699-498-910-765; 069-393-317-496-088; 079-733-431-647-434; 086-423-326-731-212; 087-189-630-811-456; 092-964-094-947-688; 096-681-074-706-209; 102-818-266-740-137; 111-390-702-618-165; 115-601-018-958-983; 116-596-673-552-472; 123-228-491-801-823; 129-987-438-950-876; 135-536-239-267-366; 142-971-121-379-979; 145-961-831-779-555; 148-474-799-291-891; 150-086-195-625-19X; 151-789-767-878-748; 155-365-804-548-542; 162-155-193-792-711; 166-687-835-869-454; 173-839-545-519-126; 181-075-215-628-410; 183-702-745-658-310; 195-822-109-592-64X; 198-326-081-238-409,1

Impact varied widely, especially between disciplines, but a limited measurement indicated an overall smaller relative impact of publications funded by library OA funds. Many open access funds operate using similar criteria related to author and publication eligibility, which seem to be largely successful at avoiding the funding of articles published in predatory journals.&#x0D;; Conclusions – Libraries have successfully funded many publications using criteria that could constitute best practices in this area. However, institutions with OA funds may need to identify opportunities to increase support for high-impact publications, as well as consider the financial stability of these funds. Alternative models for OA support are discussed in the context of an ever-changing open access landscape.</jats:p>",14,,,https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/eblip/index.php/EBLIP/article/download/29623/22131,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/eblip29623,0,,10.18438/eblip29623,2996663025,,,0

The dataset consists of more than 10,000 tweets, and these mentions, retweets and followers were used to generate a connected, undirected graph. This graph reveals the most influential tweeters by identifying the largest drop in the eigenvalue of adjacency or affinity matrix of a graph when certain nodes are removed; those which, when deleted, cause the greatest drop in the eigenvalue of the graph are considered to be the most influential. The machine-learning model applied in this work utilizes a feature vector containing the accumulated sum of the rank scores of those influential users who tweet a given article, along with known altmetric features such as the user type and post counts for various social media. Finally, the supervised-learning model was trained using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers with 11 features, including the sum of the ranks of influential users who tweet a given article in our dataset. The results were analysed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Precision Recall (PR) curves, which give the commendable outcomes compared to the baseline model. We found that, for the classification of highly cited articles, Twitter users’ score for influence is the most important feature. Finally, we show that our model—which was trained by taking the score for influence into consideration—outperforms the baseline, at 79% for ROC and 90% for PR with the Random Forest Model, effectively identifying the highly cited articles.",119,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-019-03044-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03044-9,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03044-9,2916784883,,000-114-141-599-148; 010-418-270-613-554; 012-507-229-328-759; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-326-072-540-828; 028-081-469-254-133; 037-365-847-091-505; 054-802-232-146-783; 057-286-311-076-534; 058-119-719-012-241; 059-364-709-109-256; 062-284-315-865-321; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-612-496-125-673; 068-636-673-224-780; 072-219-219-275-120; 072-463-767-991-704; 082-168-768-985-438; 088-075-229-922-003; 088-097-858-691-559; 106-388-711-261-336; 111-859-799-706-684; 116-078-245-427-966; 123-372-247-517-800; 124-030-254-225-503; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 132-565-877-157-763; 167-324-495-405-410,0

Overviews aim for a beneficial impact on clinical practice, but their methods and pathways to impact have so far not been mapped. The aim of this paper was to inform recommendations for optimizing impact on rehabilitation practice and research by mapping methods and pathways to impact in Cochrane overviews relevant to rehabilitation.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""EVIDENCE ACQUISITION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We systematically searched and identified published Cochrane overviews (to June 2018) relevant to rehabilitation. We extracted data and compared overviews on key characteristics, methods of evidence synthesis, statements about impact, and access metrics. We explored one overview in detail regarding beneficiaries, activities and outputs, mapped potential pathways to impact, and, using an iterative process, refined this into a generic map. Through exploration of all synthesized data, we propose further recommendations for planning, conducting and reporting of future overviews in order to optimize impact on rehabilitation.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We identified seven Cochrane overviews relevant to rehabilitation. Their focus and methods varied, but they were broadly related to rehabilitation interventions for populations of people with diverse long-term conditions. Overviews also varied regarding their intended impact; only 4 overviews identified specific beneficiaries. All overviews included multiple tables and figures, but only one synthesized key findings into a single figure. For five overviews, the Altmetric Attention Score (a weighted count of attention that an output receives based on a range of online sources) was in the top 5% of all research outputs scored by Altmetric. The overview within our worked example had four key impact goals, each with different beneficiaries and required actions; this example led to a generic map of potential pathways to impact for other overviews.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Cochrane overviews have the potential to play a key role in knowledge translation and therefore to be useful in supporting evidence-based rehabilitation practice. However, current overviews relating to rehabilitation differ in methods, approaches and intended impact, and sometimes fall short of promoting easy access to key information for beneficiaries. Future Cochrane overviews should address topics of importance to key beneficiaries and clearly outline potential pathways to impact in order to have a potential beneficial impact on evidence-based rehabilitation and to improve rehabilitation outcomes.</AbstractText>",55,Evidence-Based Medicine; Evidence-Based Practice; Humans; Rehabilitation; Research Design; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Translational Medical Research,,https://researchonline.gcu.ac.uk/en/publications/cochrane-overviews-how-can-we-optimise-their-impact-on-evidence-b,http://dx.doi.org/10.23736/s1973-9087.19.05780-0,0,30938138,10.23736/s1973-9087.19.05780-0,2947323292,,003-166-098-791-006; 003-375-628-612-003; 005-657-182-603-37X; 007-113-138-350-958; 013-078-437-515-544; 013-402-808-511-940; 013-973-675-801-838; 019-671-468-155-33X; 022-988-987-297-827; 023-003-704-331-210; 023-050-261-966-461; 026-430-265-469-829; 027-639-903-589-045; 036-318-136-009-87X; 037-937-107-253-354; 038-984-319-847-662; 039-004-725-571-331; 044-769-652-547-386; 046-225-001-743-719; 046-596-738-913-826; 046-731-395-529-820; 048-691-010-142-887; 049-030-797-119-522; 052-854-695-716-633; 054-662-623-411-554; 057-192-417-098-056; 059-641-035-504-147; 061-248-806-583-973; 069-631-643-351-192; 076-504-287-789-914; 077-334-819-226-416; 079-092-856-629-656; 094-091-602-912-581; 109-013-596-614-105; 122-363-810-573-73X; 124-912-096-938-560; 135-857-282-718-65X; 139-361-973-037-534; 139-362-617-596-756; 141-600-566-059-354; 144-526-395-100-039,1

The changes have necessitated a broader definition of scholarly communication and the role of social media in the research process. We sought to record the body of work that the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS), a research institute at the University of the Western Cape, produced over a 20-year period (1995–2015) – the first two decades of its existence – and to measure its visibility and impact using bibliometrics and altmetrics. A survey was also carried out to investigate to what extent PLAAS researchers knew and used social media in their research practice. Scopus and Google Scholar were used as citation indices and Altmetric.com provided Altmetric scores – a measure of impact through social and mainstream media. The full list of PLAAS outputs showed a composition of 54% grey literature and 46% journal articles and monographs. Given that over half of PLAAS research outputs were in the form of grey literature, and therefore not indexed in traditional bibliometric databases, we suggest that alternative metrics be used in conjunction with bibliometrics, to measure the impact of a body of work on the scholarly domain. Although the bibliometrics in this study were a useful quantitative indicator of the impact of PLAAS research, this study was inconclusive with regard to determining the impact of the research output via altmetrics, partly because not any of the grey literature, nor any author from PLAAS, had a unique identifier, thus making it difficult to track and find quantitative indicators. Nonetheless, the potential benefit for PLAAS of using altmetrics was demonstrated in selected case studies of the output of three PLAAS researchers active on social media platforms.;           </jats:p>",115,,,https://www.sajs.co.za/article/view/5655/7963,http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2019/5655,0,,10.17159/sajs.2019/5655,2966804491,,,0

However, citations may not be the only measure of impact. In recent years, other platforms (e.g. Twitter) have provided new tools for promoting scholarship to both academic and non-academic audiences. Alternative metrics (altmetrics) can capture non-traditional dissemination data such as attention generated on social media platforms.; ; Objectives; The aims of this exploratory study were to characterise the relationships among altmetrics, access counts and citations in an international and pre-eminent medical education journal, and to clarify the roles of these metrics in assessing the impact of medical education academic scholarship.; ; Methods; A database study was performed (September 2015) for all papers published in Medical Education in 2012 (n = 236) and 2013 (n = 246). Citation, altmetric and access (HTML views and PDF downloads) data were obtained from Scopus, the Altmetric Bookmarklet tool and the journal Medical Education, respectively. Pearson coefficients (r-values) between metrics of interest were then determined.; ; Results; Twitter and Mendeley (an academic bibliography tool) were the only altmetric-tracked platforms frequently (> 50%) utilised in the dissemination of articles. Altmetric scores (composite measures of all online attention) were driven by Twitter mentions. For short and full-length articles in 2012 and 2013, both access counts and citation counts were most strongly correlated with one another, as well as with Mendeley downloads. By comparison, Twitter metrics and altmetric scores demonstrated weak to moderate correlations with both access and citation counts.; ; Conclusions; Whereas most altmetrics showed limited correlations with readership (access counts) and impact (citations), Mendeley downloads correlated strongly with both readership and impact indices for articles published in the journal Medical Education and may therefore have potential use that is complementary to that of citations in assessment of the impact of medical education scholarship.",51,"Bibliometrics; Databases, Factual; Education, Medical; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Social Media/statistics & numerical data",,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/medu.13359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/medu.13359,0,28719136,10.1111/medu.13359,2736564473,,001-788-981-268-621; 002-092-409-542-133; 007-781-992-937-68X; 010-141-385-349-31X; 013-351-326-131-446; 018-241-426-139-167; 035-040-134-486-840; 037-331-683-577-73X; 050-252-270-491-60X; 055-788-708-180-492; 066-507-313-507-599; 071-123-245-005-332; 071-878-836-294-733; 072-463-767-991-704; 095-061-118-952-572; 102-973-599-213-44X; 121-011-195-507-937; 127-458-994-664-604; 129-896-852-419-737; 141-134-741-084-026; 186-785-165-959-868,18

We identify exemplar use cases for wider adoption in institutions and uncover future potential use cases. The findings of this study are that although use of altmetrics is at a relatively early stage when compared to traditional bibliometrics, a number of professional groups are using the tools and underlying qualitative data to enhance existing processes. This includes monitoring attention to research papers in previously difficult to track sources, reporting to funders, inclusion in grant applications and offering alongside existing bibliometrics services. Potential limitations of the study are the focus on a small sample size in three large institutions and the use of a single tool.

For library-based journal publishers who want to support multimodal scholarship, it is useful to understand the potential benefit and impact of incorporating video abstracts into their publications. This paper provides an overview of the growth of video abstracts in science scholarship, and presents a single journal case study that compares the use and potential impact of video abstracts hosted on both YouTube and on a journal’s own website. METHODS For the case study, video abstract usage data for the New Journal of Physics (NJP) was gathered from both YouTube and the NJP native platform and then correlated using a Spearman rank correlation coefficient test to analyze viewing usage. Viewership data from both platforms was also correlated with article usage counts using Spearman to study the relationship between article usage and corresponding video abstract usage. RESULTS Users predominantly accessed the journal’s hosted video abstracts instead of the abstracts posted on YouTube. However, there was a moderate positive correlation comparing view counts of the same video abstracts across both platforms, suggesting proportionate use of both platforms. In addition, the top 25 and 100 read articles had a significantly higher presence of video abstracts than articles overall in the data set, although a specific reason for that relationship cannot be identified. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION Video abstracts are a natural evolution of science communication into multimodal environments. Publishing trends will likely continue to grow gradually, with appreciation for non-traditional scholarship (multimodal scholarship) and new measures for assessing impact (altmetrics) potentially encouraging greater adoption. Librarybased journal publishers should consider investing in software that offers dynamic media integration, offering the video abstract option to their authors, and leveraging YouTube to further raise the visibility of their authors’ research articles and publication. Library-based publishers should have some expectation that the video abstracts will be viewed relatively proportionally across platforms (i.e. a video abstract that receives a higher or lower view count on the journal’s website is moderately more likely to also receive a higher or lower view count on YouTube), with the majority of total views (for all videos) coming from the journal’s website. Subject and media librarians should become more aware of these emerging practices to support the video abstract publication and creation needs of their research communities.",2,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott_Spicer/publication/262636012_Exploring_Video_Abstracts_in_Science_Journals_An_Overview_and_Case_Study/links/00b7d53848fd0215ae000000.pdf https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/exploring-video-abstracts-in-science-journals-an-overview-and-cas https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/162873 https://jlsc-pub.org/articles/abstract/10.7710/2162-3309.1110/,http://dx.doi.org/10.7710/2162-3309.1110,0,,10.7710/2162-3309.1110,2171811818,,015-321-959-327-866; 019-902-041-959-270; 022-087-286-961-459; 034-400-737-601-879; 044-827-595-197-166; 051-965-959-247-371; 099-778-705-486-696; 167-797-381-859-465; 184-621-092-779-722,12

Munafò,"Nicotine & Tobacco Research was one of the first journals I published in when starting out as a young postdoctoral researcher. Having served as a reviewer and associate editor before becoming a deputy editor in 2007, I am optimistic that the transition to editor-in-chief will be a smooth one. Most importantly, my predecessor, David Balfour, leaves the journal in an extremely strong position—we now receive in excess of 700 submissions every year, and we have steadily improved the speed with which we review and publish accepted articles. I hope to be able to carry on his good work.; ; I have recently become interested in the extent to which the scientific process is functioning optimally, and in particular the role of journals and the peer review process in ensuring the quality of what is published.1–4 At the same time, scientific publishing is going through a revolution, as open access is increasingly mandated by major funders, and traditional print formats are supplanted by online formats, including the use of new media both within the article (e.g., video) and to promote articles once published (e.g., Twitter). The impact factor is being supplemented by new means of assessing article quality, such as post-publication peer-review (e.g., PubMed Commons), blogging, and altmetrics. It is an exciting time to be taking over the helm of Nicotine & Tobacco Research.; ; My vision for the future of the journal is to embrace these changes and to continue to achieve long-lasting impact through the quality of what we publish. I have already introduced a number of relatively minor changes. For example, reviewers now have the option to sign their reviews. This is entirely optional, but there is good evidence that open peer review increases the quality of reviews.5 I am hopeful that an increasing number of our reviewers will opt to waive their anonymity and sign their reviews. Additionally, we now publish articles online very rapidly following acceptance as uncorrected proofs. In my experience most researchers are keen for their work to be available as soon as possible following acceptance, which this achieves. Finally, we have moved from the APA referencing style (i.e., author, date) to AMA style (i.e., numbered). Different researchers have their own preferences, but one clear advantage is the considerable space saving this achieves, which will allow us to publish more articles within our finite page budget (a restriction imposed on us by the fact that we are still, ultimately, a print journal).; ; I have always championed the journal, encouraging my colleagues to submit their work for consideration here. I am therefore delighted to have this opportunity, and I am fortunate to be supported by an experienced and talented group of deputy editor and associate editors and by the many colleagues who give their time to review for us. I hope I can continue to improve the standing of the journal and to serve the interests of our authors, readers, and the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.",17,Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing,,https://academic.oup.com/ntr/article/17/1/1/1160923 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4832972 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4832972/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntu222,0,25556174,10.1093/ntr/ntu222,1983286322,PMC4832972,011-948-426-219-620; 014-448-010-826-45X; 024-617-732-851-160; 030-425-337-421-604; 052-949-763-754-650,6

Pretende-se aferir o impacto das mídias sociais Mendeley, Facebook e Twitter sobre a visibilidade e o número de citações recebidas pelos artigos publicados na Revista Gaúcha de Enfermagem em um período de dez anos (entre 2007 e 2016). Os provedores dos dados para a investigação foram as bases de dados Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature e Scopus. A plataforma utilizada para a coleta de altmetrics foi o PlumX. Foram analisados 948 artigos publicados pela Revista, 2.150 citações recebidas, 7.072 capturas no Mendeley e 359 atividades no Twitter e no Facebook. Os resultados apresentados por essas três plataformas sociais demonstram a visibilidade obtida pelos artigos mesmo não sendo citados em outros trabalhos. A visibilidade dos artigos da Revista Gaúcha de Enfermagem é evidenciada pelo pequeno volume de artigos que não foram citados ou mencionados em mídias sociais (11,2%). Os resultados revelam que trabalhos não citados tiveram impacto altmétrico por meio de ações em outras mídias sociais, acadêmicas ou não. Como análises de correlação podem não ser adequadas como único método dependendo do período analisado, retratando resultados correlacionais falsos entre a publicação dos artigos, as citações recebidas e as altmetrics para períodos curtos, a adoção de métodos qualitativos, como análise de redes sociais e análise de conteúdo, pode trazer outras perspectivas para um melhor entendimento do fenômeno.</jats:p>",31,,,http://www.scielo.br/pdf/tinf/v31/2318-0889-tinf-31-e190025.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/2318-0889201931e190025,0,,10.1590/2318-0889201931e190025,2983891809,,000-114-141-599-148; 005-831-824-829-700; 015-270-923-005-163; 044-288-540-661-670; 045-095-128-463-053; 050-252-270-491-60X; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-655-416-840-66X; 072-463-767-991-704; 121-568-695-886-919; 127-629-838-081-152; 143-820-904-820-853; 180-370-935-124-873,0

El nuevo indicador, denominado usage counts o “conteo de uso”, mide el numero de veces que se accedio al texto completo de un documento o que un registro se exporto a un gestor bibliografico. Se ofrece el mismo indicador con dos ventanas temporales: uno que mide los clics en los ultimos 180 dias y otro desde 2013. Para descifrar el significado del nuevo indicador, aparte de reflexionar sobre la naturaleza de los actos que se pretenden medir, en este articulo se realiza un estudio exploratorio en el que estos nuevos indicadores de uso se comparan con los tradicionales conteos de citas, seleccionando dos submuestras: una con los documentos mas altamente citados de 2015 (hasta la fecha), y otra con los mas usados. Las grandes diferencias encontradas entre las dos submuestras parecen indicar que estos dos indicadores miden diferentes tipos de impacto. Y es que, la citacion y el uso de los documentos son acciones tan distintas que sus recuentos deben ofrecer resultados divergentes. Asimismo, se detecta una infima correlacion de los nuevos recuentos con algunos de los indicadores mas frecuentes en las altmetrics. No obstante, dado lo pequena y sesgada que es la muestra (documentos muy citados o muy usados) deben tomarse los resultados con cautela. Lo que si se puede ya afirmar es que los nuevos recuentos enriquecen el set de indicadores bibliometricos de la Web of Science y proporcionaran datos metricos sobre muchisimos documentos de los que antes no sabiamos nada.

However, due to the lag time involved in the citation-based indices, it may take years to comprehend the full impact of an article. This paper seeks to measure the early impact of research articles through the sentiments expressed in tweets about them. We claim that cited articles in either positive or neutral tweets have a more significant impact than those not cited at all or cited in negative tweets. We used the SentiStrength tool and improved it by incorporating new opinion-bearing words into its sentiment lexicon pertaining to scientific domains. Then, we classified the sentiment of 6,482,260 tweets linked to 1,083,535 publications covered by Altmetric.com. Using positive and negative tweets as an independent variable, and the citation count as the dependent variable, linear regression analysis showed a weak positive prediction of high citation counts across 16 broad disciplines in Scopus. Introducing an additional indicator to the regression model, i.e. ‘number of unique Twitter users’, improved the adjusted R-squared value of regression analysis in several disciplines. Overall, an encouraging positive correlation between tweet sentiments and citation counts showed that Twitter-based opinion may be exploited as a complementary predictor of literature’s early impact.",,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095070511930629X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105383,0,,10.1016/j.knosys.2019.105383,2995273533,,000-114-141-599-148; 001-731-506-576-898; 001-757-928-198-829; 003-671-232-262-330; 006-738-112-381-872; 007-802-414-808-093; 010-141-385-349-31X; 011-695-943-452-997; 014-299-387-059-063; 015-755-520-290-700; 028-022-504-642-650; 031-056-855-501-837; 035-181-820-222-262; 038-359-050-738-477; 039-174-266-739-36X; 040-016-339-868-94X; 041-769-786-296-632; 044-190-763-366-649; 045-065-800-988-484; 045-201-107-411-584; 046-898-802-480-53X; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-849-594-689-761; 055-725-755-643-949; 061-963-491-647-102; 065-781-988-339-445; 066-507-313-507-599; 076-058-454-642-665; 077-511-786-770-603; 077-997-287-012-544; 087-565-097-317-244; 090-086-404-988-129; 094-484-009-866-534; 095-041-092-547-633; 100-818-263-004-270; 127-458-994-664-604; 134-852-903-471-380; 139-651-430-124-012; 159-081-272-393-914; 159-843-129-711-033,0

Multicenter research confers many distinct advantages over single-center studies, including larger sample sizes for more generalizable findings, sharing resources amongst collaborative sites, and promoting networking. Well-executed multicenter studies are more likely to improve provider performance and/or have a positive impact on patient outcomes. In this manuscript, we offer a step-by-step guide to conducting multicenter, simulation-based research based upon our collective experience with the International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research and Education (INSPIRE). Like multicenter clinical research, simulation-based multicenter research can be divided into four distinct phases. Each phase has specific differences when applied to simulation research: (1) Planning phase, to define the research question, systematically review the literature, identify outcome measures, and conduct pilot studies to ensure feasibility and estimate power; (2) Project Development phase, when the primary investigator identifies collaborators, develops the protocol and research operations manual, prepares grant applications, obtains ethical approval and executes subsite contracts, registers the study in a clinical trial registry, forms a manuscript oversight committee, and conducts feasibility testing and data validation at each site; (3) Study Execution phase, involving recruitment and enrollment of subjects, clear communication and decision-making, quality assurance measures and data abstraction, validation, and analysis; and (4) Dissemination phase, where the research team shares results via conference presentations, publications, traditional media, social media, and implements strategies for translating results to practice.

Thus, citations are a target-oriented metric which measures impact on science. In contrast, societal impact measurements based on altmetrics are as a rule intended to measure impact in a broad sense on all areas of society (e.g. science, culture, politics, and economics). This tendency is especially reflected in the efforts to design composite indicators (e.g. the Altmetric Attention Score). We deem appropriate that not only the impact measurement using citations is target-oriented (citations measure the impact of papers on scientists) but also the measurement of impact using altmetrics. Impact measurements only make sense, if the target group—the recipient of academic papers—is clearly defined. Thus, we extend in this study the field-normalized reader impact indicator proposed by us in an earlier study, which is based on Mendeley data (the mean normalized reader score, MNRS), to a target-oriented field-normalized impact indicator (e.g. MNRSED measures reader impact on the sector of educational donation, i.e. teaching). This indicator can show—as demonstrated in empirical examples—the ability of journals, countries, and academic institutions to publish papers which are below or above the average impact of papers on a specific sector in society (e.g. the educational or teaching sector). Thus, the method allows to measure the impact of scientific papers on certain groups—controlling for the field in which the papers have been published and their publication year.",26,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/rseval/v26y2017i3p230-241..html https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/3/230/3798785 https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1612.01770 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01770 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1163411 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1612.01770 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1612.html#BornmannH16c,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/reseval/rvx005,0,,10.1093/reseval/rvx005,2585624576,,001-647-844-038-388; 002-666-995-736-984; 004-924-180-697-031; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-177-213-203-050; 009-865-709-406-084; 009-971-817-581-962; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-474-157-259-115; 020-647-409-662-919; 021-120-673-715-990; 022-721-791-934-342; 024-581-946-291-179; 030-964-160-765-008; 035-678-282-600-695; 038-904-999-660-101; 040-160-721-123-582; 040-252-626-797-747; 040-332-014-369-098; 042-120-011-270-12X; 045-743-655-853-646; 049-905-673-769-223; 053-086-790-955-429; 053-479-797-407-350; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 064-412-723-386-713; 066-058-608-660-901; 068-224-488-858-924; 068-417-475-849-819; 072-219-219-275-120; 085-573-871-761-262; 093-004-530-053-970; 101-752-490-869-458; 102-161-046-039-361; 106-598-824-898-46X; 111-522-539-990-419; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-353-860-287-425; 130-446-333-613-121; 134-942-428-873-91X; 138-411-397-282-780; 141-594-395-742-985; 149-086-710-081-997; 160-844-595-555-453; 175-108-212-200-68X; 179-223-065-594-04X; 189-013-156-962-802,8

WhenI presented the results, they insisted their work was moreinfluential than what the metrics suggested. I explainedwhy IFs for specialized journals were lower than moregeneralized publications such as Science or Nature, andwhy citation counts for recent articles need time to grow.I introduced the topic of altmetrics, or alternative metrics,and how they could help this faculty member build a morecomplete picture of their research impact.Altmetrics measure research impact by includingreferences outside of traditional scholarly publishing [1].These social web metrics were first proposed in 2010as a response to scholars moving their work online [2].Altmetrics analyze tweets, blogs, presentations, newsarticles, comments, or any social commentary about adiverse group of scholarly activities that are captured onthe web [2].As librarians have been explaining for years, there arelimits to what IF and h-index figures can tell us. A juniorfaculty member may have created and shared hundreds ofcaptivating lectures online but only published a fewarticles. That teaching is not reflected in their h-index.They may author a widely followed blog in which theyengage with an audience of academic peers, but there is noIF for the blog. As numbers of Twitter followers orFacebook friends quantify social media activity, altmetricsmeasure and rank researcher output, impact, and influencefrom the social web.Before continuing, I should declare any possible con-flicts of interest. I have been a tester for Altmetric.comsince September 2013, and I have enjoyed free access to theAltmetric.com Explorer. Aside from that association, I ama health librarian working in an academic research centrewithout any financial interest in altmetric products. I amwriting from the perspective of an information specialistwho uses altmetrics to track research publications, toassess the impact of my centre’s social media communica-tion strategy, and to plan future knowledge disseminationprojects.I first heard about altmetrics at the Medical LibraryAssociation conference in 2013. The topic of this intriguingnew cross-section of social media and article metricswas heard at numerous sessions. Altmetric start-ups werepushing products that measured research in a differentway, and librarians were excited to learn more.The obvious caveat about altmetrics is that they are onlyvalid and valuable for the most recent publications [3, 4].A 2013 publication in Annals of Internal Medicine on lifestyleinterventions for diabetes [5] received a score of 148 by theAltmetric.com Explorer. The score was calculated basedon 128 Twitter users sharing the publication, two bloggersciting the article, and seven Facebook users mentioning it.In context, the article was amongst the highest ever scoredin Annals of Internal Medicine, (ranked 37 out of 2470). Incontrast, a 2005 publication from the same journal oncoronary artery disease [6] received no score. Social mediamentions are rare for articles published prior to 2011 [4, 7],and altmetric products often exclude older datasets in theiranalysis [8].Some altmetric tools, such as Altmetric.com in theaforementioned example, tell us about individual articlesand others tell us about researchers. Researcher-focusedproducts, such as ImpactStory and ResearchGate, resem-ble familiar social networking sites in that they rely oncontributors creating and maintaining personal profiles.The evolution from Facebook to LinkedIn to ImpactStorymakes logical sense. User-contributed profiles becameonline re´sume´s and then dynamic curricula vitae withembedded metrics for research products. For researcher-focused altmetric tools, older publications, presentations,and products can be manually added. These products thattell us about researchers are more likely to includecontributions prior to 2011, and for that reason they arebetter for analyzing research output over time than article-focused altmetric tools.Because different altmetric tools tell different stories, thelandscape is full of start-ups positioning themselves as",35,,,https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/jchla/index.php/jchla/article/download/22907/17062 https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/jchla/index.php/jchla/article/view/22907 https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/fde9b567-5efa-4797-b14f-bff8af34ea33 https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/fde9b567-5efa-4797-b14f-bff8af34ea33/view/df897148-52cb-4fd7-8d39-55c36f0c7033/JCHLA_2014_35_2.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5596/c14-015,0,,10.5596/c14-015,1656392511,,009-303-522-533-513; 009-540-084-260-752; 016-324-861-161-626; 035-964-848-340-165; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-562-977-385-96X; 053-086-790-955-429; 053-203-389-508-251; 057-286-311-076-534; 066-507-313-507-599; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-662-520-089-891; 078-182-595-346-553; 097-244-332-505-145; 110-457-195-877-695; 127-458-994-664-604; 141-134-741-084-026,3

This study therefore aimed to explore the value of Altmetrics for assessing policy impact by analysing research articles from a single centre (the University of Sheffield) that were identified by Altmetrics as being cited in at least one policy document. Method: This study has only included published research articles from authors at the University of Sheffield and indexed in the Altmetric.com database. Altmetric data on policy impact were sourced from Altmetric.com following a data request and included citations up until February 2017. Supplementary Altmetric data including news media, blogs, Mendeley saves and Wikipedia citations were also gathered. Results: Altmetrics did enable an assessment of whether a relevant research article had had an impact on policy documents and, if so, how many such documents. In total, 1463 pieces of published research from authors at the University of Sheffield were found to be cited in between 1 and 13 policy documents. Twenty-one research articles were listed as being cited in five or more policy documents; 21 in four policy documents; 50 in three documents; 186 in two documents; and 1185 in one document. Of those 1463 outputs, 1449 were journal articles, 13 were books and one was a book chapter, and the time lag from publication to citation in policy documents ranged from 3 months to 31 years. Analysis of the 92 research articles cited in three or more policy documents indicated that the research topics with the greatest policy impact were medicine, dentistry and health, followed by social science and pure science. The Altmetrics data enabled an in-depth assessment of the 21 research articles cited in five or more policy documents. Conclusion. Within the limitations of the current text-mining system, Altmetrics can offer important and highly-accessible data on the policy impact of an organization’s published research articles.",2,,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/125996/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2017.00009/pdf https://frontiersin.figshare.com/collections/What_Can_Altmetric_com_Tell_Us_About_Policy_Citations_of_Research_An_Analysis_of_Altmetric_com_Data_for_Research_Articles_from_the_University_of_Sheffield/4330937 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2017.00009/full https://core.ac.uk/display/156974428,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frma.2017.00009,0,,10.3389/frma.2017.00009,2779916569,,006-410-674-437-517; 009-222-447-794-574; 014-003-348-981-404; 021-756-699-196-571; 022-815-023-314-850; 030-618-222-754-098; 035-479-897-595-720; 035-988-212-620-838; 037-331-683-577-73X; 040-332-014-369-098; 041-769-786-296-632; 042-120-011-270-12X; 042-680-222-610-281; 047-554-785-245-163; 049-074-912-879-039; 053-086-790-955-429; 055-831-901-562-709; 068-417-475-849-819; 073-456-837-936-18X; 077-883-831-430-323; 078-351-256-357-519; 079-048-755-904-331; 083-227-473-245-073; 089-914-448-038-331; 098-701-475-771-018; 156-904-716-291-384; 166-731-347-367-055,1

This paper is based on interviews conducted with staff involved with the development of the repository, and the open access collection in particular, at each of the three institutions.

It also tries to examine the correlation between altmetric and bibliometric indicators. Design/methodology/approach: This descriptive study was carried out using altmetric indicators. The research sample consisted of 1,000 most-cited articles in Nature. In February 2019, the bibliographic information of these articles was extracted from the Scopus database. Then, the titles of all articles were manually searched on Google, and by referring to the article in the journal website and altmetric institution, the data related to social media presence and altmetric score of articles were collected. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS. Findings: According to the results of the study, from 1,000 articles, 989 of them (98.9 per cent) were mentioned at least once in different social media websites and tools. The most used altmetric source in highly cited articles was Mendeley (98.9 per cent), followed by Citeulike (79.8 per cent) and Wikipedia (69.4 per cent). Most Tweets, blog posts, Facebook posts, news stories, readers in Mendeley, Citeulike and Connotea and Wikipedia citations belonged to the article titled “Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search”. The highest altmetric score was 3,135 which belonged to this paper. Most tweeters and articles’ readers were from the USA. The membership type of the tweeters was public membership. In terms of fields of study, most readers were PhD students in Agricultural and Biological Sciences. Finally, the results of Spearman’s Correlation revealed positive significant statistical correlation between all altmetric indicators and received citations of highly cited articles (p-value = 0.0001). Practical implications: The results of this study can help researchers, editors and editorial boards of journals better understand the importance and benefits of using social media and tools to publish articles. Originality/value: Altmetrics is a relatively new field, and in particular, there are not many studies related to the presence of articles in various social media until now. Accordingly, in this study, a comprehensive altmetric analysis was carried out on 1000 most-cited articles of one of the world's most reliable journals. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",47,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IDD-07-2019-0050/full/html http://eprints.umsha.ac.ir/id/eprint/5352,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/idd-07-2019-0050,0,,10.1108/idd-07-2019-0050,2981080668,,004-924-180-697-031; 007-205-762-763-201; 008-150-591-136-318; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-813-208-836-925; 013-848-964-561-065; 018-439-684-800-564; 022-435-246-189-861; 023-898-989-623-283; 042-960-490-465-267; 043-495-392-935-371; 044-288-540-661-670; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-252-270-491-60X; 052-129-828-982-897; 054-802-232-146-783; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 066-507-313-507-599; 069-212-434-484-793; 072-463-767-991-704; 083-304-448-410-627; 089-914-448-038-331; 096-438-024-010-035; 097-994-139-888-028; 098-173-749-418-937; 102-276-478-923-871; 102-973-599-213-44X; 110-457-195-877-695; 122-073-156-920-876; 126-062-861-008-278; 127-458-994-664-604; 141-902-329-730-312; 149-040-025-444-303; 180-830-256-204-948,0

As organizational units emphasize the work of training, recruiting, retaining, and promoting an inclusive scientific body, issues around bias and metrics appear frequently in the literature. The goal of this manuscript is to introduce some of the most commonly misunderstood areas of bias, and ways to adjust hiring and promotion practices; and to focus on innovative ways to quantify scientific outputs through metrics other than journal impact factors and paper citation numbers. These alternative metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly reliable predictors of impact for a scientific community that is asked to engage more frequently and more effectively with the public. Additionally, we address discipline-specific concerns around metrics used for hiring and promotion in biosecurity and biosafety, taxonomy, and researchers in government and regulatory roles. We conclude that in the future, societal and scholarly impact will be more closely tied.

The sample size was determined to be 1892 articles using the Cochrane formula and data were gathered by using the PLOS altmetrics. The study's model fit indices showed that visibility influences citation both directly and indirectly through the mediating role of save. Discussion had a significant, negative role in the relationship between visibility and citation, and recommendation did not have any significant mediating role in this relationship. Among the social networks presenting altmetrics, it seems that networks such as Mendeley which provide a basis for saving scientific articles have an important and significant effect on the amount of future citations through visibility metrics. This is while social networks discussing scientific findings have a negative effect on the future citation of articles through visibility metrics.

O’Reilly-Shah,"Abstract Purpose: We sought to delineate highly visible publications related to sepsis. Within these subsets, elements of altmetrics performance, including mentions on Twitter, and the correlation between altmetrics and conventional citation counts were ascertained. Materials and Methods: Three subsets of sepsis publications from 2012 to 2017 were synthesized by the overall Altmetric.com attention score, number of mentions by unique Twitter users, and conventional citation counts. For these subsets, geolocated Twitter activity was plotted on a choropleth, the lag between publication date and altmetrics mentions was characterized, and correlations were examined between altmetrics performance and normalized conventional citation counts. Results: Of 57,152 PubMed query results, Altmetric.com data was available for 28,344 (49.6%). The top 50 publications by Altmetric.com attention score and Twitter attention represented a mix of original research and other types of work, garnering attention from Twitter users in 143 countries that was highly contemporaneous with publication. Altmetrics performance and conventional citation counts were poorly correlated. Conclusions: While unreliable to gauge impact or future citation potential, altmetrics may be valuable for parties who wish to detect and drive public awareness of research findings and may enable researchers to dynamically explore the reach of their work in novel dimensions.",48,Bibliometrics; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Sepsis; Social Media,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944118308839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2018.09.033,0,30296750,10.1016/j.jcrc.2018.09.033,2894807725,,000-129-851-143-921; 000-615-712-284-55X; 000-796-759-922-809; 001-731-506-576-898; 002-092-320-866-430; 002-543-374-000-042; 003-063-421-056-342; 003-254-479-923-236; 003-569-704-904-557; 004-073-918-099-888; 005-682-639-367-165; 006-212-924-168-405; 006-474-300-818-852; 006-519-765-824-343; 006-773-284-559-562; 006-784-190-464-494; 007-686-915-501-30X; 007-792-087-982-142; 009-530-831-831-805; 010-121-323-443-353; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-151-611-581-782; 010-418-270-613-554; 010-905-880-580-559; 011-191-578-492-376; 012-007-074-359-284; 012-509-668-043-658; 012-823-475-785-407; 013-225-717-440-847; 013-333-619-819-747; 014-173-572-776-423; 015-174-280-700-84X; 015-307-437-128-607; 015-767-418-646-940; 016-590-693-609-330; 016-838-417-252-888; 017-150-060-168-237; 018-209-844-692-440; 018-545-445-531-140; 018-785-563-749-960; 020-162-936-836-559; 020-249-759-749-973; 020-939-229-867-823; 021-310-294-698-729; 021-582-161-741-358; 021-899-888-531-285; 022-535-010-135-451; 023-094-764-149-433; 024-360-554-656-82X; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-041-449-288-732; 026-052-027-802-221; 026-365-650-771-727; 026-402-039-581-38X; 026-489-148-072-976; 027-428-151-071-883; 027-643-887-500-89X; 028-719-181-099-613; 029-109-928-591-963; 029-480-778-783-789; 029-625-467-756-972; 029-896-905-168-252; 029-989-883-299-923; 030-014-420-219-398; 030-019-663-630-686; 030-486-507-130-068; 031-301-689-003-731; 031-908-596-329-098; 032-599-594-525-140; 032-888-988-217-459; 033-027-107-941-562; 034-289-524-137-299; 034-484-103-431-637; 034-673-447-450-412; 035-097-635-619-055; 035-784-348-838-153; 036-029-757-308-441; 037-364-556-764-71X; 037-620-366-987-63X; 037-950-124-446-031; 038-107-047-654-79X; 038-414-951-509-101; 045-333-465-818-936; 047-436-441-352-101; 047-833-479-466-453; 048-947-418-069-659; 051-608-747-273-396; 053-131-339-604-106; 053-252-366-951-403; 054-971-384-658-099; 055-618-404-715-644; 056-250-961-306-88X; 056-470-162-040-688; 056-650-250-615-611; 056-694-452-889-922; 057-364-236-115-505; 059-177-887-309-732; 059-847-731-638-919; 061-522-060-246-602; 061-759-793-604-433; 063-169-117-222-678; 063-345-595-376-719; 065-920-351-545-185; 066-002-495-120-577; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-155-935-374-102; 067-448-945-920-284; 069-507-561-844-489; 070-619-090-239-283; 072-463-767-991-704; 074-991-949-620-404; 075-150-613-700-195; 075-699-553-813-873; 076-058-454-642-665; 076-935-695-696-578; 079-722-551-030-11X; 081-000-634-836-167; 081-096-053-120-389; 082-025-672-914-303; 082-168-768-985-438; 082-280-422-413-280; 082-590-894-561-875; 083-663-368-812-727; 085-861-147-113-594; 086-266-810-634-581; 087-885-496-691-404; 088-241-182-761-249; 088-665-828-209-306; 089-354-400-351-318; 090-550-401-629-725; 090-657-928-655-954; 093-429-420-207-530; 094-216-618-085-521; 098-822-870-181-991; 101-324-867-120-121; 102-921-282-283-461; 105-355-023-823-537; 111-657-230-032-560; 114-251-883-659-335; 116-661-965-783-908; 118-100-189-980-847; 120-704-163-032-696; 123-797-086-811-665; 123-833-583-794-777; 127-041-151-847-337; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 139-029-749-678-578; 139-598-726-933-855; 143-015-245-614-789; 143-820-904-820-853; 146-327-097-073-811; 148-679-614-072-14X; 155-953-485-674-461,4

First, the motivation behind questionable research practices is examined (the desire to get ahead or, at least, not fall behind). Next, behavior modification strategies are discussed, pointing out that the carrot works better than the stick. Finally, we suggest that the best way to achieve real change is to make a tool so useful that academics make time to learn and utilize it on their own. Implementation of current change initiatives is hindered by a lack of norms, high initial buy-in costs, and uncertain payoffs. With this in mind, we pull together current open science tools to increase the utility while lowering effort and risk. One, centralized, easy to use, platform, with a profile, a feed of targeted science stories based on previous system interaction, a sophisticated (public) comment and rating section, and impact metrics which use the available data can be used to realign individual and group motives.

Les variables suivantes ont ete extraites pour chaque indicateur : nom, methode de calcul, fenetre temporelle du calcul, sources de donnees considerees, conditions d’acces, inclusion des autocitations, forces et faiblesses. Au total, 15 indicateurs ont ete inclus : sept indicateurs de revues, quatre pour les chercheurs et quatre pour les articles.

Using bibliometric and altmetric indicators, it seeks to analyze the impact and subsequent use of their scholarly works on social and scientific platforms. Fifty-five authors with the highest productivity were identified, based on the results of bibliometric studies on InfoLit carried out on both an international and Ibero-American scale in searches of major databases as well as publications collected in a Latin American wiki. Subsequently an analysis of bibliometric and altmetric indicators at the author and publication level was carried out, based on the results of searches on eight scientific platforms (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley, ORCID, IraLIS, E-LIS and EXIT), three social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and data provided by a commercial supplier (Altmetric.com). Overall we found a greater presence of authors in ResearchGate (58%), Academia.edu (51%) and Google Scholar (49%) as opposed to Mendeley (25%) and ORCID (18%). Furthermore, as to social platforms, the greatest potential influence lies with Facebook, due to its high number of followers ( / top 10 authors). In addition, an analysis with the Spearman rho statistic, shows among some sources and platforms, a low correlation between the number of citations in Google Scholar and readings in Mendeley (r = 382) and low negative for mentions in blogs (r = 0,-237), Google+ (r = 0, -214) and Twitter (r = 0, -183). In conclusion, both the productivity and the impact-visibility center on specific authors writing about InfoLit, and various measurement resources show that for these authors there is a positive two-way impact from bibliometric to altmetric and vice versa.",40,,,http://redc.revistas.csic.es/index.php/redc/article/view/984/1517 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6530947 http://repositorio.usil.edu.pe/handle/USIL/2709 https://core.ac.uk/display/89388257 http://redc.revistas.csic.es/index.php/redc/article/download/984/1518 http://repositorio.usil.edu.pe/bitstream/USIL/2709/1/2017_Alhuay_Estudio-metrico-de-ALFIN-en-Iberoamerica.pdf http://eprints.rclis.org/31710/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/redc.2017.3.1414,0,,10.3989/redc.2017.3.1414,2752944914,,000-172-905-765-78X; 005-788-491-757-196; 006-450-046-066-379; 013-848-964-561-065; 014-701-924-017-196; 019-138-714-714-737; 021-696-172-742-263; 025-470-212-568-17X; 031-772-888-195-060; 033-518-090-321-581; 034-585-355-602-394; 040-081-269-911-009; 041-648-733-693-182; 068-340-263-134-747; 069-622-741-632-33X; 071-740-770-012-964; 114-065-850-549-413; 122-073-156-920-876; 127-458-994-664-604; 128-511-665-080-540; 139-651-430-124-012; 141-212-834-542-277; 147-096-933-427-955; 161-467-367-060-593; 199-488-020-166-331,3

Woolley,"Objective: Since 1998, JAMA has published peer-reviewed Patient Pages to help healthcare professionals (HCPs) promote credible information to patients. With patient empowerment and social media, the public, rather than HCPs, may be the primary promotors of such publications. Publication professionals are becoming more involved in patient-centric publications and should know who engages with such publications. We investigated engagement with JAMA’s Patient Pages, based on Twitter activity. Research design and methods: For this controlled cross-sectional analysis, sequential (November 2013-November 2015; n = 86) free-access JAMA Patient Pages were matched for topic and time to JAMA articles (controlling for journal; n = 86) and to free-access, MEDLINE-listed articles (controlling for access; n = 86).  Altmetric and Twitter data were analyzed by an independent academic statistician. Results: For each of the 3 publication types, the median number of tweets was significantly higher for the public compared with HCPs: Patient Pages (34 vs 8; P50.001); JAMA articles (28 vs 9; P50.001); MEDLINE articles (1 vs 0; P = 0.002). The median number of tweeters, median number of followers, median Altmetric scores, and percent of articles having the US as the top tweeting country were significantly higher for Patient Pages (49; 226,720; 35; 93%) and JAMA articles (47; 214,773; 42; 88%) compared with MEDLINE articles (1; 183; 1; 23%); for each outcome, the difference between Patient  Pages or JAMA articles vs MEDLINE was P50.001; no significant differences were detected between Patient Pages vs JAMA articles. Conclusions: Members of the public can be more powerful promoters of peerreviewed publications, whether patient-centric or not, than HCPs.

It was proposed an altmetric index to identify the most consulted titles of Cuban publishers that distribute their contents on the e-Libro.com academic platform. Design/Methodology/Approach . The Wally Index is defined as the quotient of the Ln (# queries) of a title between the maximum Ln (# queries) of the set of titles evaluated in a defined period of time. The usefulness of this Index was validated from the study of the distribution of titles of six Cuban publishers that include their titles in the academic platform e-Libro.com, during the period September 2016 - August 2017. Results / Discussion. The Wally Index vs . # Titles of Cuban publishers available on e-libro.com were adjusted to the power model, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.7299, although titles with smaller numbers of queries showed greater dispersion, so that evaluated this index with the collection of the 226 most consulted titles. With this sample, the Wally Index 'normalized vs . ranking of the titles reached the value of the Pearson correlation coefficients R2 = 0.8992 with a logarithmic adjustment. Conclusions . The use of the Wally Index is proposed for the evaluation of the queries of a set of titles, selected under specific criteria, available on Web platforms that provide data on the queries. The index is relative to the collection of titles and is independent of the number of queries. Originality/Value . The Wally Index can be used by any publisher who wants to examine the queries that receive their titles in the web environment.",14,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/6312042.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6312042 https://biblat.unam.mx/es/revista/bibliotecas-anales-de-investigacion/articulo/el-indice-wally-una-propuesta-altmetrica-para-las-editoriales-cubanas-indexadas-en-la-plataforma-e-libro-com http://revistas.bnjm.cu/index.php/anales/article/view/4226/3860 http://eprints.rclis.org/32444/,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6312042,0,,,2794822391,,,1

E. van der Wall,"In June 2013, the impact factors for the year 2012 were released (Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports® 2012, ISI Web of Knowledge). The impact factor is defined as the average number of citations received per paper divided by the published articles in a specific journal during the preceding 2 years [1–3]. The 2012 impact factor of the Netherlands Heart Journal (NHJ) was 1.411. The 2012 NHJ impact factor was calculated as follows: in 2012, the total number of citations to articles published in the years 2010 and 2011 was 207. The number of articles published in 2010 and 2011 was 146. As a result, the 2012 impact factor was 206 citations divided by 144 articles: 206/146 = 1.411. The NHJ impact factor has therefore remained rather constant over the past 4 years: 1.392 in 2009, 1.447 in 2010, 1.438 in 2011, and 1.411 in 2012. Of course, we are striving to increase our impact factor over the forthcoming years (see the article by Tobias Opthof in the July/August edition of NHJ this year) [4].; ; ; From a European perspective, the impact factors of 2012 show the following interesting facts:; ; ; Out of a total number of 122 cardiovascular journals (subject category Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems), the European Heart Journal (EHJ) moved to the second place with a 2012 impact factor of 14.097, directly behind Circulation (2012 impact factor of 15.202) and ahead of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) with a 2012 impact factor of 14.086. Last year, the EHJ already ranked in the third place behind JACC (second) and Circulation (first). As a result, the EHJ Editor-in-Chief Thomas Luscher (Zurich, Switzerland) and the EHJ Editorial Board should be complimented. First place is within reach!; ; ; For the cardiovascular journals directed by Dutch Editors-in-Chief, the following remarkable results for the 2012 impact factors were observed:; ; The European Journal of Heart Failure (EJHF), fitting in the family of journals belonging to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), received a 2012 impact factor of 5.247 versus a 2011 impact factor of 4.896, a rewarding increase. The Editorial Board of the EHJF is chaired by Dirk Jan van Veldhuisen (Groningen, the Netherlands) with Wiek van Gilst and Adriaan Voors as Deputy Editors.; ; ; For the journal Eurointervention, also part of the ESC journal family, with Patrick Serruys (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) as Editor-in-Chief, the 2012 impact factor was rather similar to the 2011 impact factor (3.285 in 2011 versus 3.173 in 2012); ; ; The impact factor of the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology (another member of the ESC journal family), with Diederick Grobbee (Utrecht, the Netherlands) as Editor-in-Chief, moved from 2.634 in 2011 to 3.903 in 2012, a considerable increase!; ; ; The impact factor of the European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing (also part of the ESC journal family), chaired by Tiny Jaarsma (currently residing in Norrkoping, Sweden) as Editor-in-Chief, increased significantly from 1.711 in 2011 to 2.042 in 2012; ; ; Finally, the impact factor of the International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging (CAIM), supervised by Hans Reiber (Leiden, the Netherlands) as Editor-in-Chief, moved from 2.285 in 2011 to 2.648 in 2012, also an obvious increase; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; The above-mentioned Editors-in-Chief should be congratulated on attaining a fine 2012 impact factor. This can be viewed as a major accomplishment, especially when recognising that there are currently more than 40,000 scientific journals worldwide.; ; Over time, impact factors have become the holy grail in the scientific journal domain [5]. Many authors wish to publish in the journals with the highest impact factors because this will increase their scientific image, their professional profile, and their academic career perspectives. As a result, every journal editor works hard to improve the journal’s impact factor because it is viewed by publishers as an index of journal quality and success, determining the extent to which the journal is resourced by its sponsoring organisation or publisher [6–8]. However, there are many confounders that may influence the impact factor, at least challenging the scientific significance of an impact factor [9–12].; ; Nallomothu and Luscher recently suggested that medical journals should move from the concept of ‘impact’ to ‘influence’ [12]. To that purpose, article-level metrics will probably play a more prominent role in the near future. As opposed to the impact factor, article-level metrics provide a major step forward in evaluating the performance of individual articles published in (cardiovascular) journals [13]. The Public Library of Science (PLoS) has been instrumental in developing several article-level metrics that integrate traditional approaches such as the impact factor which measures scientific impact with overall interest and readership. Pertinent questions are: 1) How often do others comment on articles and how do peers ‘rank’ these articles? 2) How many of the articles are being downloaded, and for how long? 3) How often are text, tables, and figures from the article ‘cut-and-pasted’? 4) How often are articles being selected by blogs, twitter, and lay media outlets? [12–15]. The concept of using article-level metrics, as a more objective and reliable way of measuring journal influence, may provide the true impact of a scientific journal.; ; In summary, the impact factor is still considered to be the nec plus ultra for authors, editors, publishers, and academic institutions. Although it is not very likely that a valid substitute for the impact factor will soon be implemented, the use of article-level metrics sounds noteworthy and hopeful. Until this approach has been accepted as a solid, reliable, and objective bibliometric index, we remain dependent on the impact factor for a journal quality index.",21,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81738645 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3751025 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12471-013-0455-2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3751025/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81738645.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12471-013-0455-2,0,23943566,10.1007/s12471-013-0455-2,1975892498,PMC3751025,003-925-723-437-876; 004-317-674-602-157; 004-739-092-641-252; 005-345-912-920-789; 018-643-239-850-246; 019-435-118-341-592; 023-995-402-233-441; 037-504-042-966-64X; 038-260-853-743-00X; 058-103-061-501-375; 062-695-011-519-952; 089-914-448-038-331; 095-033-859-449-300; 111-669-932-743-904; 141-134-741-084-026; 177-594-039-051-172,3

When providers gave discrepant results for the same metric, the maximum value was used. Publons data are described, and correlations are calculated between Publons metrics and altmetric and bibliometric indicators.&#x0D;; Main Results – In terms of coverage, Publons is biased in favour of life sciences and subject areas associated with health and medical sciences. Open access publishers are also over-represented. Articles reviewed in Publons overwhelmingly have one or two pre-publication reviews and only one post-publication review. Furthermore, the metrics of significance and quality (rated on a 1 to 10 scale) are almost identically distributed, suggesting that users may not distinguish between them. Pearson correlations between Publons metrics and bibliometric and altmetric indicators are very weak and not significant.&#x0D;; Conclusion – The biases in Publons coverage with respect to discipline and publisher support earlier research and suggest that the willingness to publish one’s reviews differs according to research area. Publons metrics are problematic as research quality indicators. Most publications have only a single post-publication review, and the absence of any significant disparity between the scores of significance and quality suggest the constructs are being conflated when in fact they should be measuring different things. The correlation analysis indicates that peer evaluation in Publons is not a measure of a work’s quality and impact.</jats:p>",14,,,https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/eblip/index.php/EBLIP/article/download/29579/22077,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/eblip29579,0,,10.18438/eblip29579,2973447102,,,0

Several opportunities for further development of the initial inventory are highlighted, as well as potential for using the inventory as a tool to guide project management, funding, and research on citizen science.",68,,,https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/68/6/436/4955835 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70196448,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioscience/biy028,0,29867253,10.1093/bioscience/biy028,2796015744,,000-826-091-294-906; 005-383-882-370-567; 005-597-291-165-047; 008-274-528-761-959; 018-690-916-011-629; 022-526-129-975-007; 023-191-184-135-304; 032-724-693-254-016; 038-071-975-135-261; 045-181-423-237-180; 047-833-007-161-424; 061-572-756-037-417; 070-462-022-251-464; 073-543-721-417-391; 081-879-304-771-516; 084-149-167-565-234; 084-374-719-159-703; 091-204-512-390-272; 097-752-172-168-83X; 105-340-601-620-124; 107-518-655-388-824; 147-023-625-223-646; 160-225-755-201-265; 163-418-904-722-452; 186-031-697-646-650,2

Theoretically, prestigious journals are read widely because of the high impact of their articles on medical practice; journal prestige has traditionally been quantiﬁed with the journal impact factor. Initially described by Garﬁeld 2,3 and now published annually by Thomson Reuters, 4 journal impact factor uses citations in other scientiﬁc journals to quantify the inﬂuence of an original research journal as a whole, calculating the ratio of citations of previous 2 years’ articles during the current year to the total number of citable articles published in that journal during those previous 2 years (Figure 1A and B). 4 Journal impact factor posits that the impact of a journal is the weighted sum of the citations, and therefore the impact, of its articles. Authors’ work has increasingly been assessed by the impact of the journal it is published in for the purposes of university promotions, general esteem among colleagues, 5 and hiring and funding decisions. 6,7 Despite its popularity, journal impact factor is widely criticized. 8 Detractors note that it is inherently slow (citations take months to years to accrue, and journal impact factor is published annually according to 1- to 3-year-old data 9 ), narrow (it assesses only this one particular type of impact 10 during a brief 2-year period 11 ), secretive and irreproducible (articles are weighted according to an opaque and subjective classiﬁcation such as primary, review, or “front matter,” classiﬁcations that are subject to lobbying by publishers 11 ), and open to gaming (some types of articles are cited much more frequently than others 10,11 ), and fails to identify inﬂuential articles published in minor journals. Other journal-level metrics have been created but fail to address these issues, 12,13 and the h-index was developed in Volume no. 2005 to measure the impact of authors rather than journals. It combines an individual’s productivity (number of articles) and impact (number of citations) to quantify their contributions. 14 However, it also has drawbacks: it is slow, can be manipulated (eg, self-citation), does not adjust for the number or role of coauthors (particularly because coauthorship has increased signiﬁcantly 15 ), and poorly recognizes early-career authors or those with small numbers of articles with high impact. 16 ALTMETRICS: ARTICLE-LEVEL METRICS Contrary to citation-based metrics like the journal impact factor and h-index, altmetrics (short for “alternative metrics” or “article-level metrics”) promptly measure the impact of an individual article’s dissemination. 17 The widespread adoption of electronic publishing, paired with the rise of social media for dissemination and discussion of scientiﬁc literature, makes it feasible to quantify the discussion of an article on blogs, podcasts, social media platforms, and news media. These measures aim to address many of the failings of traditional impact metrics; they are available nearly instantaneously, measure the dissemination of individual articles, and may more accurately assess total overall readership by incorporating more metrics—primarily measures of social media—rather than simply citations in traditional journals. As a result, highly disseminated articles may be identiﬁed within days of their publication. 18-21 Although altmetrics have certain advantages over citation-based metrics such as the journal impact factor and h-index, the type of impact that they measure, although related, is not the same. We propose that altmetrics be thought of as measures of “disseminative impact,” whereas traditional citation-based metrics be considered measures of “scholarly impact.” Altmetrics provide a proxy of a speciﬁc article’s overall readership, and articles capable of generating “buzz” are likely to score more highly. 19,20 The journal impact factor and h-index are derived from citations and are likely to link more strongly with the importance of Annals of Emergency Medicine 1",66,Bibliometrics; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Publishing,,https://core.ac.uk/display/30774584 https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(15)00328-5/fulltext https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26004769 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2v22758b http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064415003285 https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/the-altmetric-score-a-new-measure-for-article-level-dissemination,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2015.04.022,0,26004769,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2015.04.022,2114094964,,002-257-308-877-076; 004-531-193-733-452; 012-710-701-872-04X; 015-270-923-005-163; 019-658-209-137-261; 026-741-238-800-262; 035-964-848-340-165; 039-505-270-645-642; 046-893-167-334-37X; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-129-828-982-897; 059-294-959-717-405; 066-507-313-507-599; 068-128-557-934-813; 071-123-245-005-332; 073-657-168-689-716; 090-511-163-661-241; 093-526-375-493-56X; 099-816-321-816-355; 101-752-490-869-458; 105-748-979-947-689; 123-687-398-098-005; 132-723-851-457-646; 137-126-628-585-297,70

The statistical population consists of all the highly cited articles on surgery indexed on the Web of Science. The number of article citations was measured using the Web of Science and the altmetric score of the articles using the Altmetric Bookmarklet. The analysis of the data was carried out using descriptive statistics and Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Of the 1077 highly cited surgery articles, 62.74 per cent had an altmetric score. The highest number of received citations was 1787, and the highest altmetric score was 2019. A positive and significant correlation was observed between the number of citations and the policy-making documents, Wikipedia citations and CiteULike (P&lt;0.001). A positive but non-significant correlation was also observed between the number of citations and the number of Mendeley readers (r=0.02, P&gt;0.05). A poor, negative and significant correlations were observed between the number of citations and the overall altmetric score of the highly cited surgery articles (r=-0.235, P&lt;0.001). The findings may be due to the different pattern of using social media by the surgery researchers compared to the researchers of other fields. Altmetrics can only be used to complement citations and not replace them.&#x0D;; &#x0D;; &#x0D;; </jats:p>",39,,,https://publications.drdo.gov.in/ojs/index.php/djlit/article/download/14204/7124,http://dx.doi.org/10.14429/djlit.39.4.14204,0,,10.14429/djlit.39.4.14204,2968762801,,,0

Here, we describe a workflow for publishing citeable data in the context of the environmental sciences--an area spanning many domains and generating a vast array of heterogeneous data products. The processes and tools we have developed have enabled rapid publication of quality data products including datasets, models and model outputs which can be accessed, re-used and subsequently cited. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before researchers in the environmental sciences fully accept the notion that datasets are valued outputs and time should be spent in properly describing, storing and citing them. Here, we identify current challenges such as citation of dynamic datasets and issues of recording and presenting citation metrics. In conclusion, whilst data centres may have the infrastructure, tools, resources and processes available to publish citeable datasets, further work is required before large-scale uptake of the services offered is achieved. We believe that once current challenges are met, data resources will be viewed similarly to journal publications as valued outputs in a researcher's portfolio, and therefore both the quality and quantity of data published will increase.",18,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00799-016-0175-5 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00799-016-0175-5 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42492571.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00799-016-0175-5,0,,10.1007/s00799-016-0175-5,2430280848,,007-454-474-945-657; 019-476-121-509-705; 024-198-157-569-375; 026-367-890-333-071; 035-337-163-214-868; 043-895-570-866-544; 044-182-641-469-690; 065-943-238-845-364; 080-934-665-116-667; 101-351-470-031-968; 116-052-417-726-263; 119-005-930-433-565; 149-592-353-001-259; 150-085-629-478-541; 157-053-244-656-966; 163-427-813-071-222,1

As such, it is essential that today's nursing academic keep up to date with the core competencies needed for survival in a modern research career, particularly the intersecting triad of bibliometrics, altmetrics and social media.; ; Design; Discussion paper.; ; Data sources; Published literature and relevant websites.; ; Implications for nursing; The rise of social media and altmetrics has important implications for contemporary nursing scholars who publish their research. Some fundamental questions when choosing a journal might be ‘does it have a Twitter and/or Facebook site, or a blog (or all three)’; and ‘does it have any other presence on social media, such as LinkedIn, Wikipedia, YouTube, ResearchGate and so on?’ Another consequence of embracing social media is that individual academics should also develop their own strategies for promoting and disseminating their work as widely as possible.; ; Conclusion; The rising importance of social media and altmetrics can no longer be ignored, and today's nursing academic now has another facet to consider in their scholarly activities. Despite the changing nature of research dissemination, however, it is still important to recognize the undoubted value of established knowledge dissemination routes (that being the peer-reviewed publication).",72,Bibliometrics; Humans; Nursing Research; Research; Social Media,,https://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:13534 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jan.13067 https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/49131/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27399604,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jan.13067,0,27399604,10.1111/jan.13067,2461638445,,000-574-096-541-648; 001-348-817-115-974; 003-160-945-475-905; 005-389-787-220-058; 006-369-072-945-600; 007-359-816-909-053; 009-213-899-405-934; 010-282-238-580-748; 012-049-052-084-342; 013-123-944-981-275; 013-868-595-887-50X; 014-088-679-854-552; 015-485-493-898-675; 015-874-236-737-052; 016-629-615-073-37X; 018-548-258-123-807; 018-629-194-886-753; 020-630-580-962-662; 021-120-673-715-990; 022-654-070-571-396; 025-317-884-954-347; 026-292-185-225-864; 029-165-255-951-763; 030-618-222-754-098; 034-368-810-407-697; 035-988-212-620-838; 036-753-708-390-642; 037-995-713-689-583; 042-120-011-270-12X; 043-495-392-935-371; 046-431-912-854-230; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-321-809-623-386; 051-439-175-569-321; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-752-463-682-385; 057-843-607-992-960; 058-593-263-741-427; 062-357-316-755-022; 069-128-305-810-917; 087-273-107-208-793; 090-741-145-756-363; 101-752-490-869-458; 102-276-478-923-871; 122-831-069-402-018; 131-383-545-197-44X; 132-723-851-457-646; 137-126-628-585-297; 150-445-653-788-845; 152-219-071-626-237; 182-421-230-687-043,15

Design A cross-sectional study. Setting The United States. Participants The subject of analysis was 11 436 journal articles on cancer funded by the US government published in 2016. These articles were identified via PubMed and characterised as receiving online media attention based on data provided by Altmetric. Results 16.8% (n=1925) of articles published on US government-funded research were covered in the media. Published journal articles addressed all common cancers. Frequency of journal articles differed substantially across the common cancers, with breast cancer (n=1284), lung cancer (n=630) and prostate cancer (n=586) being the subject of the most journal articles. Roughly one-fifth to one-fourth of journal articles within each cancer category received online media attention. Media mentions were disproportionate to actual burden of each cancer type (ie, incidence and mortality), with breast cancer articles receiving the most media mentions. Scientific articles also covered the stages of the cancer continuum to varying degrees. Across the 13 most common cancer types, 4.4% (n=206) of articles focused on prevention and control, 11.7% (n=550) on diagnosis and 10.7% (n=502) on therapy. Conclusions Findings revealed a mismatch between prevalent cancers and cancers highlighted in online media. Further, journal articles on cancer control and prevention received less media attention than other cancer continuum stages. Media mentions were not proportional to actual public cancer burden nor volume of scientific publications in each cancer category. Results highlight a need for continued research on the role of media, especially online media, in research dissemination.",9,,,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e025783 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782941 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/2/e025783.full.pdf http://summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/18845/e025783.full_.pdf https://summit.sfu.ca/item/18845,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025783,0,30782941,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025783,2949172759,,003-955-466-158-960; 010-542-077-263-108; 011-069-529-809-956; 011-125-552-454-544; 011-610-149-936-075; 016-778-364-395-639; 031-369-005-879-988; 035-242-133-419-537; 036-208-703-645-008; 038-139-050-260-093; 041-197-617-177-631; 041-995-340-548-554; 059-970-181-787-939; 061-412-416-110-080; 066-044-181-111-526; 066-231-590-232-285; 066-390-884-747-952; 066-726-671-268-719; 073-284-155-905-345; 084-934-407-032-589; 085-330-031-337-972; 088-043-530-193-392; 088-154-645-074-336; 092-491-770-941-920; 109-671-068-826-571; 118-345-963-149-418; 137-284-192-546-740; 146-739-841-337-274; 151-471-617-833-093; 152-599-601-770-672,0

This presentation will summarize the steering committee’s work and describe the librarian’s contribution. ; Methods: ; The Committee’s project leader first conducted a literature search on best practices of social media in medical and health professional curricula. A reference website was then created (mse.med.umontreal.ca) to provide easy access to a large number of the articles and resources reviewed. A steering committee was constituted and 11 meetings were held over a 9-month period. The Committee comprised 18 members and included assistant deans, academic program directors, professors, communication advisors, undergraduate and graduate students and a librarian. An online survey on social media use by students and professors of the Faculty was conducted, ten pilot projects were put forward and a three-year strategic plan was proposed. ; Results: ; A total of 1508 students and 565 professors participated in the survey. Results showed that both groups had a strong interest in learning how social media could be integrated in academic and professional activities. Participants reported concern with risks associated with social media use and expressed the need for a Faculty policy and guidelines.; The librarian’s contribution to the steering committee included: writing posts on the website’s internal blog, assisting in the design of the survey questionnaires and writing the final report’s survey results chapter. She also proposed two pilot projects: creating a social media learning portal and an altmetrics workshop. ; Conclusions: ; Based on the literature review and the survey results, the Committee affirmed the importance of integrating social media in the various study programs of the Faculty of Medicine. Despite the restricted timeline, this interprofessional steering committee was able to carry out its mandate because of the leadership and expertise of each of its members.

The study population comprised of 218 biomedical research papers have been indexed in F1000 system in the period 2012-2014. A sample of 100 research articles were purposely selected from F1000 system based on the purpose of the research. Variables associated with altmetrics measures were extracted from F1000 and variables associated with citation measures were from Google scholar. Data analysis was conducted by SPSS software version 16 using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results of this study indicate a significant positive correlation between variables associated with altmetrics and citation measures. They also confirm a strong positive correlation between Altmetrics indicators. However, the measures of the number of the authors and the funding supply of the articles show no significant correlation with altmetrics and citation measures. So an Altmetrics measure presents a new way to measure the impact of writers and publications which is a complementary to traditional assessment indicators. The significant correlation between altmetrics and citation metrics indicate that combination of traditional and altmetrics indicators presents a more complete history of the writer or the article which provides clear dimensions of scientific assessment of research.",31,,,https://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2736-en.html http://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2736-en.pdf,https://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2736-en.html,0,,,2202925226,,,1

This study has three objectives: a) to analyse the uptake of some of the most popular platforms (Google Scholar Citations, ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley and Twitter) by a specific scientific community (bibliometrics, scientometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and altmetrics); b) to compare the metrics available from each platform; and c) to determine the meaning of all these new metrics. To do this, the data available in these platforms about a sample of 811 authors (researchers in bibliometrics for whom a public profile Google Scholar Citations was found) were extracted. A total of 31 metrics were analysed. The results show that a high number of the analysed researchers only had a profile in Google Scholar Citations (159), or only in Google Scholar Citations and ResearchGate (142). Lastly, we find two kinds of metrics of online impact. First, metrics related to connectivity (followers), and second, all metrics associated to academic impact. This second group can further be divided into usage metrics (reads, views), and citation metrics. The results suggest that Google Scholar Citations is the source that provides more comprehensive citation-related data, whereas Twitter stands out in connectivity-related metrics.",12,,,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1804.05599 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1804.html#abs-1804-05599 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180405599M/abstract https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v12y2018i2p494-509.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157717302316 https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05599 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05599,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2018.04.001,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2018.04.001,2798094593,,001-311-234-725-616; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-808-575-904-822; 006-113-740-631-844; 006-450-046-066-379; 008-150-591-136-318; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-418-270-613-554; 014-144-058-523-949; 014-772-466-372-040; 019-120-240-188-628; 019-243-269-480-737; 020-647-409-662-919; 021-696-172-742-263; 024-704-447-017-762; 025-470-212-568-17X; 030-245-319-431-165; 034-145-218-792-807; 040-252-626-797-747; 048-421-366-629-821; 048-590-055-863-124; 049-329-632-532-219; 051-965-959-247-371; 054-802-232-146-783; 055-840-426-103-857; 059-222-532-022-222; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-897-343-637-16X; 069-169-184-648-685; 073-105-177-560-919; 073-770-607-036-536; 075-267-966-095-209; 086-809-706-245-39X; 099-816-321-816-355; 102-921-338-726-605; 107-518-655-388-824; 109-328-246-156-69X; 119-239-701-895-258; 120-216-619-680-200; 122-073-156-920-876; 124-924-423-439-995; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-317-360-512-157; 130-446-333-613-121; 132-388-166-608-244; 132-626-974-159-177; 141-134-741-084-026; 145-837-941-098-824; 149-661-584-078-911; 163-591-801-241-575; 169-829-696-386-902,9

We can now track the life of each individual paper after it has been published and better understand how it is read and how it is used. This creates a tremendous opportunity for new alternative metrics (“altmetrics”) to give us a much better sense of a paper's true impact.

Schimanski; Juan Pablo Alperin,"Review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) processes significantly affect how faculty direct their own career and scholarly progression. Although RPT practices vary between and within institutions, and affect various disciplines, ranks, institution types, genders, and ethnicity in different ways, some consistent themes emerge when investigating what faculty would like to change about RPT. For instance, over the last few decades, RPT processes have generally increased the value placed on research, at the expense of teaching and service, which often results in an incongruity between how faculty actually spend their time vs. what is considered in their evaluation. Another issue relates to publication practices: most agree RPT requirements should encourage peer-reviewed works of high quality, but in practice, the value of publications is often assessed using shortcuts such as the prestige of the publication venue, rather than on the quality and rigor of peer review of each individual item. Open access and online publishing have made these issues even murkier due to misconceptions about peer review practices and concerns about predatory online publishers, which leaves traditional publishing formats the most desired despite their restricted circulation. And, efforts to replace journal-level measures such as the impact factor with more precise article-level metrics (e.g., citation counts and altmetrics) have been slow to integrate with the RPT process. Questions remain as to whether, or how, RPT practices should be changed to better reflect faculty work patterns and reduce pressure to publish in only the most prestigious traditional formats. To determine the most useful way to change RPT, we need to assess further the needs and perceptions of faculty and administrators, and gain a better understanding of the level of influence of written RPT guidelines and policy in an often vague process that is meant to allow for flexibility in assessing individuals.",7,Academic Success; Career Mobility; Faculty; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Publications; Research; Teaching,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325612/ https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1605,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.16493.1,0,30647909,10.12688/f1000research.16493.1,2895416954,PMC6325612,000-216-174-888-955; 004-150-180-500-482; 004-336-608-355-366; 006-214-161-108-795; 006-710-430-326-874; 009-005-093-809-087; 009-870-224-664-647; 011-623-388-069-645; 013-261-296-086-031; 014-445-476-837-675; 017-192-215-339-535; 017-761-836-150-441; 019-436-189-761-222; 020-151-674-388-384; 020-766-706-371-44X; 023-442-434-747-228; 024-617-732-851-160; 026-766-376-947-570; 027-979-024-024-76X; 028-555-711-209-528; 028-663-348-884-489; 036-203-160-881-887; 036-621-953-794-208; 037-049-131-162-481; 037-918-524-869-228; 040-913-231-469-445; 042-687-384-548-953; 042-916-013-581-793; 043-470-074-895-799; 049-630-937-963-063; 051-540-572-943-045; 051-965-959-247-371; 059-247-458-694-047; 062-277-403-179-246; 063-934-817-696-204; 066-839-689-325-444; 068-991-751-298-731; 072-659-437-372-016; 074-723-950-821-130; 078-377-388-689-57X; 079-375-374-536-801; 081-813-901-216-455; 097-126-305-045-377; 098-188-325-536-35X; 099-384-287-491-06X; 102-655-312-625-33X; 103-569-400-603-451; 107-711-465-423-080; 110-205-117-141-542; 114-635-285-383-925; 115-451-124-631-406; 119-733-983-543-042; 120-360-716-854-029; 120-755-443-730-210; 121-902-455-117-601; 124-673-413-178-759; 131-658-303-141-910; 132-632-428-840-740; 148-695-523-213-840; 158-921-787-039-079; 169-763-138-924-404; 169-963-027-068-226; 177-008-308-087-620; 193-630-828-274-200,16

The primary goal of scholarly communication is improving human knowledge and sharing is the key to achieve this goal: sharing ideas, sharing methodologies, sharing of results, sharing data, information and knowledge. Although the concept of sharing applies to all phases of scholarly communication, most often the only visible part is the final publication, with the journal article as a most common type. The traditional characteristics of the present journals allow only limited possibilities for sharing the knowledge. Basic functions, registration, dissemination, certification, and storage, are still present but they are no more effective in the network environment. Registration is too slow, there are various barriers to dissemination, certification system has many shortcomings, and used formats are not suitable for the long term preservation and storage. Although the journals today are digital and various powerful technologies are available, they are still focused on their unaltered printed versions. This presentation will discuss possible evolution of journal article to become more compliant with users' needs and to enable “the four R’s of openness” – reuse, redistribute, revise and remix (Hilton, Wiley, Stein, & Johnson, 2010). Several aspects of openness will be presented and discussed: open access, open data, open peer review, open authorship, and open formats. With digital technology which has become indispensable in the creation, collection, processing and storage of data in all scientific disciplines the way of conducting scientific research has changed and the concept of ""data-driven science"" has been introduced (Ware & Mabe, 2009). Sharing research data enhances the capabilities of reproducing the results, reuse maximizes the value of research, accelerating the advancement of science, ensuring transparency of scientific research, reducing the possibility of bias in the interpretation of results and increasing the credibility of published scientific knowledge. The open peer review can ensure full transparency of the entire process of assessment and help to solve many problems in the present scholarly publishing. Through the process of the open peer review each manuscript can be immediately accessible, reviewers can publicly demonstrate their expertise and could be rewarded, and readers can be encouraged to make comments and views and to become active part of the scholarly communication process. The trend to to describe the author's contribution is also present, which will certainly lead to a reduced number of “ghost”, ""guest"" and ""honorary"" authors, and will help to establish better standards for author’s identification. Various web technologies can be used also for the semantic enhancement of the article. One of the most important aspects of semantic publication is the inclusion of the research data, to make them available to the user as an active data that can be manipulated. It is possible to integrate data from external sources, or to merge the data from different resources (data fusion) (Shotton, 2012), so the reader can gain further understanding of the presented data. Additional options provide merging data from different articles, with the addition of the component of time. Other semantic enhancement can include enriched bibliography, interactive graphical presentations, hyperlinks to external resources, tagged text, etc. Instead of mostly static content, journals can offer readers dynamic content that includes multimedia, ""living mathematics"", “executable articles”, etc. Videos highlighting critical points in the research process, 3D representations of chemical compounds or art works, audio clips with the author's reflections and interviews, and animated simulations or models of ocean currents, tides, temperature and salinity structure, can became soon common part of every research article. The diversity of content and media, operating systems (GNU / Linux, Apple Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows), and software tools that are available to researchers, suggests the usage of the appropriate open formats. Different formats have their advantages and disadvantages and it would be necessary to make multiple formats available, some of which are suitable for ""human"" reading (including printing on paper), and some for machine reading that can be used by computers without human intervention. Characteristics and possibilities of several formats will be discussed, including XML as the most recommended format, which can enable granulate document structure as well as deliver semantics to the human reader or to the computer.

Smith; Austin L. Chiang; Deborah Bowman; Michael B. Wallace,"Background and Aims Social media activity in the area of scientific journal publications has increased significantly over the last decade. Several studies have suggested that journal article citations can be positively impacted by an increase in social media activity. Preliminary data have also suggested that published articles in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology that were discussed on Twitter were independently associated with higher citation rates compared with those that were not. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (GIE) is the most widely cited endoscopy-focused journal in the world. We aimed to assess the association of social media exposure of published articles in GIE and its impact on article citations. Methods Data regarding journal article publication status, number of citations per article, and social media exposure per article using Altmetric data were collected from the publisher. All original articles published in GIE from 2000 to 2016 were reviewed. Editorials, case reports, and other nonresearch correspondence were excluded. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess for independent Altmetric predictors of higher citation rates over time. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of an article mention on various social media platforms and whether it was cited during the study period. Results A total of 2361 original research articles were evaluated; 2050 articles (86.8%) were cited at least once during the follow-up period. Mean number of citations per article was 16.8 ± 23. The average Altmetric Attention score was 2.0 ± 13. The most profound independent predictor of article citation was whether an article was tweeted (odds ratio [OR], 14.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.93-22.45). Other predictors were Facebook posts (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.51) and number of Mendeley readers (OR, 1.359; 95% CI, 1.28-1.45). On multivariable linear regression, number of tweeters (β = 2.3, P = .022), F1000 reviews (β = 5.87, P  Conclusions For original articles published in GIE, there was a strong association between social media exposure on Twitter and rates of journal article citations. To a lesser degree, Facebook posts and Mendeley readers also were associated with a higher rate of article citations. This could represent both cause and effect and may be representative of higher quality articles being more commonly mentioned on social media by third-party users. A randomized controlled study evaluating different degrees of social media exposure on individual articles could be considered to further assess for causality.",90,,,https://www.giejournal.org/article/S0016-5107(19)30219-6/fulltext https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016510719302196,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2019.03.028,0,30935934,10.1016/j.gie.2019.03.028,2927229334,,010-393-512-386-940; 024-488-416-889-150; 035-800-259-148-481; 041-911-188-558-094; 050-252-270-491-60X; 067-655-416-840-66X; 070-165-651-115-034; 071-123-245-005-332; 076-730-596-742-437; 095-061-118-952-572; 118-345-963-149-418,0

Examples of notable observations are that 5% countries account for 76% of global GIScience output; a paper published 15 years ago received a median of 12 citations; and the share of international collaborations in GIScience has more than tripled since 2000 31% papers had authors from multiple countries in 2014, an increase from 10% in 2000.",30,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:tudelft.nl:uuid:d68ede82-db5e-4470-b12b-e48a13ea9611 https://tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13658816.2015.1130831 https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1130831 http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:d68ede82-db5e-4470-b12b-e48a13ea9611 https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:d68ede82-db5e-4470-b12b-e48a13ea9611?collection=research https://core.ac.uk/display/33249181 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2015.1130831,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1130831,0,,10.1080/13658816.2015.1130831,2281037046,,001-239-634-558-067; 001-570-631-760-067; 002-092-409-542-133; 002-257-308-877-076; 002-424-642-140-112; 003-456-110-198-340; 004-562-686-496-688; 004-924-180-697-031; 005-011-849-467-618; 005-158-697-544-931; 005-743-000-629-669; 005-843-978-306-345; 006-940-003-530-006; 007-278-123-857-567; 007-795-098-160-316; 008-404-859-515-579; 009-498-363-490-044; 009-623-583-279-160; 009-680-290-520-847; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-321-394-483-64X; 010-409-999-603-436; 010-610-048-175-215; 010-985-966-961-419; 012-164-182-768-359; 012-303-716-992-038; 012-355-354-046-662; 013-116-036-213-574; 013-345-662-832-021; 014-162-175-828-388; 014-740-466-346-444; 015-254-586-059-098; 018-024-692-270-685; 018-453-547-282-036; 018-586-396-111-692; 019-036-486-468-628; 019-696-069-676-331; 020-037-136-242-530; 020-574-736-729-573; 022-927-689-315-434; 022-971-044-628-458; 023-617-220-458-182; 024-073-114-050-099; 024-244-392-663-93X; 024-780-668-498-584; 024-927-648-860-391; 026-202-580-620-416; 027-280-837-066-319; 027-878-089-184-964; 028-184-871-252-402; 028-573-286-692-481; 029-054-339-138-305; 029-214-535-293-96X; 030-416-570-557-01X; 031-484-334-998-05X; 032-817-122-123-170; 033-026-404-227-010; 034-270-773-540-281; 035-863-837-369-170; 036-917-956-752-348; 037-227-037-133-966; 040-452-112-976-920; 040-627-295-978-700; 041-350-376-172-845; 041-648-733-693-182; 042-887-768-366-741; 045-144-662-867-70X; 045-281-528-093-740; 046-631-302-526-674; 047-071-282-670-380; 049-597-123-759-926; 049-737-427-586-480; 049-803-050-429-196; 050-886-092-294-893; 051-862-424-436-262; 051-965-959-247-371; 054-235-573-329-010; 055-222-575-590-371; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-808-236-401-052; 057-792-431-875-041; 058-238-890-202-143; 058-593-263-741-427; 058-864-928-855-958; 059-868-166-893-548; 060-336-833-192-584; 060-437-117-669-217; 063-019-842-609-468; 065-414-698-977-292; 066-058-608-660-901; 066-157-807-178-011; 067-270-674-961-475; 068-789-266-275-465; 069-146-006-064-335; 069-386-555-204-92X; 070-134-957-592-878; 070-954-892-653-417; 071-102-077-100-53X; 072-026-420-861-446; 072-130-811-247-427; 075-482-249-694-34X; 077-157-275-462-204; 077-617-659-956-697; 079-637-852-174-452; 080-900-153-389-682; 082-291-165-855-187; 082-366-214-673-579; 082-795-441-076-85X; 083-377-450-779-789; 084-235-341-094-257; 084-811-015-817-002; 085-228-177-458-717; 085-261-169-473-700; 086-809-706-245-39X; 087-713-716-135-485; 087-963-028-925-979; 088-046-621-943-471; 088-908-268-737-277; 089-027-605-678-869; 089-593-433-574-591; 090-393-436-050-389; 090-539-224-982-001; 093-329-483-246-029; 095-602-897-961-847; 095-826-769-608-064; 095-870-319-336-397; 096-324-528-548-466; 097-237-223-478-939; 098-542-912-652-805; 101-201-232-713-249; 101-765-621-554-257; 102-045-111-433-755; 103-622-195-744-158; 105-975-567-342-966; 107-518-655-388-824; 108-353-150-065-038; 109-106-551-303-584; 110-438-421-333-597; 110-457-195-877-695; 112-424-914-007-883; 113-042-536-143-927; 116-846-756-039-235; 117-094-720-234-570; 117-217-270-245-252; 117-467-775-715-645; 117-782-375-820-462; 120-866-705-546-424; 122-073-156-920-876; 125-589-095-649-096; 125-866-696-751-005; 127-490-942-209-837; 132-800-324-271-352; 135-974-280-449-09X; 136-315-909-867-529; 139-651-430-124-012; 140-600-831-725-99X; 140-971-064-849-723; 143-454-899-526-176; 143-691-808-778-781; 144-170-848-109-307; 146-889-441-198-571; 148-492-787-587-491; 149-462-548-757-915; 150-376-244-479-826; 152-033-940-293-927; 152-065-591-634-602; 155-761-725-445-806; 157-359-840-127-229; 171-043-106-533-632; 171-090-817-368-292; 171-392-112-011-094; 175-353-588-840-350; 183-829-609-143-898; 185-691-191-720-531; 186-203-816-657-474; 186-519-452-688-034; 187-677-310-822-832; 199-013-571-310-062,10

Unfortunately, altmetrics scores are currently available only for recent articles and cannot be used as covariates in predicting long term impact of publications. However, the study of their statistical properties is a subject of evident interest to scientometricians. Applying the same approaches used in the literature to assess the universality of citation distributions, the intention here is to test whether the universal distribution also holds for Mendeley readerships. Results of the analysis carried out on a sample of publications randomly extracted from the Web of Science confirm that readerships seem to share similar shapes across fields and can be rescaled to a common and universal form. Such rescaling results as not particularly effective on the right tails.

Article-level metrics (ALMs) provide a wide range of metrics about the uptake of an individual journal article by the scientific community after publication. They include citations, statistics of usage, discussions in online comments and social media, social bookmarking, and recommendations. In this editorial, the role of article level metrics in publishing scientific papers has been described. Article-Level Metrics (ALMs) are rapidly emerging as important tools to quantify how individual articles are being discussed, shared, and used. Data sources depend on the tool, but they include classic metrics indicators depending on citations, academic social networks (Mendeley, CiteULike, Delicious) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and Youtube).  The most popular tools used to apply this new metrics are: Public Library of Science - Article-Level Metrics, Altmetric, Impactstory and Plum Analytics. Journal Impact Factor (JIF) does not consider impact or influence beyond citations count as this count reflected only through Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science® database. JIF provides indicator related to the journal, but not related to a published paper. Thus, altmetrics now becomes an alternative metrics for performance assessment of individual scientists and their contributed scholarly publications. Macedonian scholarly publishers have to work on implementing of article level metrics in their e-journals.

Lamb; Sophie L. Gilbert; Adam T. Ford,"Science communication is seen as critical for the disciplines of ecology and conservation, where research products are often used to shape policy and decision making. Scientists are increasing their online media communication, via social media and news. Such media engagement has been thought to influence or predict traditional metrics of scholarship, such as citation rates. Here, we measure the association between citation rates and the Altmetric Attention Score-an indicator of the amount and reach of the attention an article has received-along with other forms of bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact factor, and article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated with citation rates. However, in recent years, we detected increasing media exposure did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier years; signalling a diminishing return on investment. Citations correlated with journal impact factors up to ∼13, but then plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing citations does not require publishing in the highest-impact journals. We conclude that ecology and conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research through social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance under traditional measures of scholarly activity.",6,,,https://peerj.com/articles/4564/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29666750 https://core.ac.uk/display/155259930 https://peerj.com/articles/4564.pdf https://www.openchannels.org/literature/22687 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4564 https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4564,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4564,0,29666750,10.7717/peerj.4564,2797866561,,000-053-672-701-563; 005-251-563-976-874; 005-969-100-665-44X; 006-239-894-492-684; 006-521-783-232-547; 011-854-399-312-637; 014-618-360-379-492; 014-693-846-921-042; 016-748-700-268-309; 019-181-477-415-517; 020-608-633-882-906; 024-704-447-017-762; 025-070-099-208-363; 028-989-358-976-539; 029-104-898-709-621; 031-301-689-003-731; 031-378-712-356-136; 032-701-497-609-420; 033-067-866-990-337; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-698-084-662-440; 050-777-308-189-572; 051-965-959-247-371; 059-222-532-022-222; 059-676-299-361-653; 063-969-066-710-238; 066-491-671-301-685; 066-507-313-507-599; 071-284-330-654-051; 076-730-596-742-437; 086-685-350-382-999; 099-927-039-017-201; 107-928-929-157-313; 130-446-333-613-121; 150-113-445-118-088; 160-285-967-873-076,13

Taylor,"When using alternative metrics (altmetrics) to investigate the impact of a scholar’s work, researchers and librarians are typically cautioned that altmetrics will be less useful for older works of scholarship. This is because it is difficult to collect social media and other attention retroactively, and the numbers will be lower if the work was published before social media marketing and promotion were widely accepted in a field. In this article, we argue that altmetrics can provide useful information about older works in the form of documenting renewed attention to past scholarship as part of a scholar’s legacy. Using the altmetrics profile of the late Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, often referred to as “the father of modern transplantation”, we describe two cases where altmetrics provided information about renewed interest in his works: a controversy about race and genetics that shows the ongoing impact of a particular work, and posthumous remembrances by colleagues which reveal his scholarly legacy.",5,,,http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/33327/ http://www.palrap.org/ojs/index.php/palrap/article/download/154/622 http://palrap.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/palrap/article/view/154 http://www.palrap.org/ojs/index.php/palrap/article/view/154 https://core.ac.uk/display/129770101 http://palrap.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/palrap/article/download/154/622 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/129770101.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5195/palrap.2017.154,0,,10.5195/palrap.2017.154,2765146652,,,0

Only a few studies have previously investigated the relationship between altmetrics and assessments by peers. In the first step, we analyse the underlying dimensions of measurement for traditional metrics (citation counts) and altmetrics–by using principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). In the second step, we test the relationship between the dimensions and quality of papers (as measured by the post-publication peer-review system of F1000Prime assessments)–using regression analysis. The results of the PCA and FA show that altmetrics operate along different dimensions, whereas Mendeley counts are related to citation counts, and tweets form a separate dimension. The results of the regression analysis indicate that citation-based metrics and readership counts are significantly more related to quality, than tweets. This result on the one hand questions the use of Twitter counts for research evaluation purposes and on the other hand indicates potential use of Mendeley reader counts.",13,"Empirical Research; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Peer Group; Peer Review, Research/standards; Principal Component Analysis; Social Media",,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07291 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197133 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1711.07291 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07291 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29791468,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197133,0,29791468,10.1371/journal.pone.0197133,2797204405,,001-271-392-227-010; 005-262-664-660-602; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-959-149-034-606; 009-447-623-801-823; 010-418-270-613-554; 010-474-157-259-115; 015-755-520-290-700; 016-948-465-445-016; 019-161-426-176-781; 021-120-673-715-990; 024-581-946-291-179; 024-598-484-212-261; 024-704-447-017-762; 026-365-650-771-727; 029-165-255-951-763; 030-964-160-765-008; 032-783-259-804-281; 035-875-745-239-000; 037-306-820-743-518; 038-364-984-344-072; 038-904-999-660-101; 042-236-742-402-776; 042-368-705-063-781; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 061-973-752-492-962; 064-778-162-089-714; 090-080-554-893-312; 093-664-234-944-828; 109-857-753-937-128; 120-870-232-770-910; 122-337-595-520-571; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 141-572-410-470-627; 158-926-736-232-728; 159-843-129-711-033; 189-013-156-962-802,20

Sugimoto., eds. Scholarly Metrics Under the Microscope: From Citation Analysis to Academic Auditing. Series: ASIST Monograph. Medford: Information Today. 2015. 976 pp. ISBN-13: 978-1573874991""What began life as a tool for retrieving the literature of science, ..., has become, unwittingly, the basis of a system for calibrating scientific performance and shaping careers,"" (Cronin and Sugimoto).This quote will resonate with many academics/researchers. Given the current emphasis on performance and reputation building, as demonstrated by academics' on-going quest to increase citation rates and h-index, it is easy to lose sight of the original intent of citation indexes; even more so when one discovers that some administrators in academe see a relationship between salaries and citation rates (Jonker and Hicks).This book consists of a representative cross-section of writings published on scholarly metrics between 1955 and 2014 and is meant to serve as a one-stop resource that focuses on the theoretical, conceptual, methodological, and ethical concerns associated with scholarly metrics. It is also a comprehensive and critical reader of the birth and development of scholarly metrics as reflected in the literature. The papers (55 of them) are essentially reprints of the originals as only minimal changes (such as the removal of fax numbers, e-mail addresses and such) were made.The documents are not arranged in chronological order, but the first one takes the reader back to the 1955 paper by Eugene Garfield: ""Citation Indexes for Science: A New Dimension in Documentation Through Association of Ideas"", originally published in Science. Reading this paper reminds one that the original intent was to create a tool for literature research, to provide researchers with the ability to trace the origin of ideas and to ""eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers."" (Cronin and Sugimoto).In working through this volume, the variety of readings is refreshing. The editors collected scholarly papers, editorial commentaries, blog posts, and letters that elucidate current trends and explain the history of how we arrived at the various applications of scholarly metrics.This mammoth work, comprising almost 1000 pages, is arranged according to six different themes: 1) Concepts and theories, 2) Validity issues, 3) Data sources, 4) Indicators, 5) Science policy, and 6) Systemic effects. Each section consists of between seven and eleven contributions. As the editors indicate in the introduction, one could possibly argue for a different arrangement of these papers according to different criteria, but these themes appear to work well enough to produce a framework that is conducive to exploring the breadth and depth of scholarly metrics and its many variants The editors start each of the six sections with a ""scene-setting"" introduction which is helpful in providing additional context for the papers collected in that specific section. It is also beneficial to have the goals of the section presented to the reader in these introductions.In the first section, ""Concepts and Theories"", some attention is given to the problems arising from the way in which citations are used. It is pointed out that references to other papers are done for various reasons, and that counting and comparing the numbers of citations would be a valid exercise only if these references were normatively governed and consistently applied. However, since such behaviour is inherently subjective, depending on circumstance and authors' motivation, the use thereof for faculty evaluations is highly questionable at best. Some attention is also given to more recent developments, such as webometrics and altmetrics, pointing out that there are many questions that remain unanswered in the use of these metrics. …",10,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3760023911/scholarly-metrics-under-the-microscope-from-citation,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3760023911/scholarly-metrics-under-the-microscope-from-citation,0,,,1488788462,,,0

Tran; Selenay Aytac,"Objective – This paper explores how to utilize two well-known library databases, Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science and Elsevier’s Scopus, to quantify Long Island educational institutions’ scholarly productivity.; ; Methods – Institutions located in the Long Island region and within Nassau and Suffolk counties, including the State University of New York (SUNY) colleges, private institutions, and technical schools, were examined for the last 14 years (2000–2013). Eight Long Island institutions were represented in both databases and were included in the study.; ; Results – Of the eight institutions, Stony Brook University produced the most publications indexed in Web of Science and Scopus during the period of 2000–2013. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory yielded the second most publications during 2000–2013 in both Web of Science and Scopus, but it produced the highest quality publications compared with other institutions excluding Stony Brook University. Although the annual growth rates of Farmingdale State College and New York Institute of Technology increased dramatically in both Web of Science and Scopus, the large proportional increase did not represent a large increase in total value. Additionally, some institutions had a higher number of publications indexed in Web of Science than in Scopus, and others had a higher number of publications indexed in Scopus than in Web of Science.; ; Conclusions – Data were collected from institutions in Long Island with various institutional sizes, the number of faculty members employed may have made an impact on the number of publications. Thus, publication data in this study cannot be used to compare their rankings. Institutions with a similar type and similar size of faculty members should be selected for comparison. Due to the different coverage and scope of Web of Science and Scopus, institutions should use both databases to examine their scholarly output. Furthermore, institutions should consider using altmetrics to capture various impacts of the scholarly output to complement the traditional metrics.",11,,,https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/EBLIP/article/download/27170/20810 https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/eblip/index.php/EBLIP/article/view/27170/20742,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/b8js8p,0,,10.18438/b8js8p,2524620595,,003-254-479-923-236; 010-387-674-493-027; 011-087-453-725-447; 019-675-247-743-435; 029-324-646-876-604; 032-114-706-877-872; 032-191-978-875-095; 043-709-661-796-885; 047-603-905-486-163; 058-800-531-062-084; 070-212-018-137-202; 075-352-488-884-33X; 107-276-900-991-821; 108-064-287-667-258; 109-874-521-291-422; 125-901-451-110-948; 140-431-197-446-875; 147-921-330-257-464; 166-237-620-787-373; 170-559-126-468-947; 177-276-688-028-665; 177-936-108-871-949,0

We aimed to describe online media attention of articles evaluating cancer treatments and identify the factors associated with high online media attention. We systematically searched MEDLINE via PubMed on March 1, 2015 for articles published during the first 6 months of 2014 in oncology and medical journals with a diverse range of impact factors, from 3.9 to 54.4, and selected a sample of articles evaluating a cancer treatment regardless of study design. Altmetric Explorer was used to identify online media attention of selected articles. The primary outcome was media attention an article received online as measured by Altmetric score (i.e., number of mentions in online news outlets, science blogs and social media). Regression analysis was performed to investigate the factors associated with high media attention, and regression coefficients represent the logarithm of ratio of mean (RoM) values of Altmetric score per unit change in the covariate. Among 792 articles, 218 (27.5%) received no online media attention (Altmetric score = 0). The median [Q1–Q3] Altmetric score was 2.0 [0.0–8.0], range 0.0–428.0. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with high Altmetric score were presence of a press release (RoM = 10.14, 95%CI [4.91–20.96]), open access to the article (RoM = 1.48, 95%CI [1.02–2.16]), and journal impact factor (RoM = 1.10, 95%CI [1.07–1.12]. As compared with observational studies, systematic reviews were not associated with high Altmetric score (RoM = 1.46, 95%CI [0.74–2.86]; P = 0.27), nor were RCTs (RoM = 0.65, 95%CI [0.41–1.02]; P = 0.059) and phase I/II non-RCTs (RoM = 0.58, 95%CI [0.33–1.05]; P = 0.07). The articles with abstract conclusions favouring study treatments were not associated with high Altmetric score (RoM = 0.97, 95%CI [0.60–1.58]; P = 0.91). Most important factors associated with high online media attention were the presence of a press release and the journal impact factor. There was no evidence that study design with high level of evidence and type of abstract conclusion were associated with high online media attention.",2,,,https://paperity.org/p/80105081/factors-associated-with-online-media-attention-to-research-a-cohort-study-of-articles http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5803628 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41073-017-0033-z https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs41073-017-0033-z https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-017-0033-z https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s41073-017-0033-z https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451556,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41073-017-0033-z,0,29451556,10.1186/s41073-017-0033-z,2619825639,,002-889-659-159-303; 002-989-438-208-835; 007-205-762-763-201; 007-677-928-589-908; 018-316-190-359-473; 019-036-823-242-954; 023-708-085-693-297; 031-177-299-306-256; 047-352-830-944-356; 049-902-212-921-284; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-265-432-624-591; 051-541-441-280-776; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-129-828-982-897; 062-177-334-101-454; 062-706-041-659-199; 066-507-313-507-599; 066-726-671-268-719; 071-123-245-005-332; 085-330-031-337-972; 087-038-833-207-824; 091-452-344-491-48X; 093-325-625-641-393; 093-776-327-811-174; 099-339-578-313-850; 100-601-601-034-484; 102-973-599-213-44X; 116-183-569-851-506; 125-635-026-701-326; 137-126-628-585-297; 141-924-984-391-73X; 146-739-841-337-274; 186-914-939-829-193,10

The indicators compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g. on Facebook) of a unit (e.g., a researcher or institution) with the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields and publication years (the expected values). In this study, we propose a third indicator (Mantel-Haenszel quotient, MHq) belonging to the same indicator family. The MHq is based on the MH analysis – an established method in statistics for the comparison of proportions. We test (using citations and assessments by peers, i.e. F1000Prime recommendations) if the three indicators can distinguish between different quality levels as defined on the basis of the assessments by peers. Thus, we test their convergent validity. We find that the indicator MHq is able to distinguish between the quality levels in most cases while MNPC and EMNPC are not. Since the MHq is shown in this study to be a valid indicator, we apply it to six types of zero-inflated altmetrics data and test whether different altmetrics sources are related to quality. The results for the various altmetrics demonstrate that the relationship between altmetrics (Wikipedia, Facebook, blogs, and news data) and assessments by peers is not as strong as the relationship between citations and assessments by peers. Actually, the relationship between citations and peer assessments is about two to three times stronger than the association between altmetrics and assessments by peers.",12,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157717303978 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/infome/v12y2018i3p998-1011.html http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1712.html#abs-1712-02228 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2018.01.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2018.01.010,0,,10.1016/j.joi.2018.01.010,2963761964,,001-552-758-640-696; 001-976-473-572-537; 005-262-664-660-602; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-729-374-381-619; 009-303-522-533-513; 009-971-817-581-962; 010-057-293-861-47X; 015-755-520-290-700; 019-161-426-176-781; 020-122-240-726-734; 021-120-673-715-990; 022-815-023-314-850; 024-704-447-017-762; 024-841-048-708-014; 026-365-650-771-727; 030-119-363-887-39X; 030-618-222-754-098; 030-964-160-765-008; 035-144-028-934-431; 035-678-282-600-695; 037-306-820-743-518; 038-089-570-409-258; 038-254-320-715-769; 039-090-602-197-064; 040-160-721-123-582; 040-332-014-369-098; 042-120-011-270-12X; 053-086-790-955-429; 055-788-708-180-492; 055-808-236-401-052; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 058-914-133-640-307; 066-058-608-660-901; 067-227-549-025-924; 068-417-475-849-819; 072-219-219-275-120; 073-474-712-890-703; 073-916-406-447-098; 075-751-303-826-167; 082-886-915-862-283; 085-573-871-761-262; 090-741-145-756-363; 098-446-719-249-299; 100-720-001-794-350; 103-455-013-608-951; 106-598-824-898-46X; 109-857-753-937-128; 111-294-779-118-265; 121-182-804-437-943; 130-446-333-613-121; 130-623-328-861-459; 140-256-665-222-712; 150-070-576-398-617; 161-092-247-791-596,9

The growth of Web technologies has opened new avenues for Web researchers for measurement and analyses of the phenomenon. Webometrics is traditionally used for quantifying Web data related to footprints of researchers or institutions on the Web measured in terms of their research publications and other parameters. The paper looks at the recent developments in webometrics research in light of emergence of social Web and big data, and their applications in new research fronts and future perspective of webometrics research. The paper also discusses about the recent developments in research techniques in webometrics such as query splitting and virtual memetics in the social network sites. It is observed that the growth of Web technologies has possibly posed new challenges for traditional citation databases which have been extensively used so far for measuring research impact of universities, institutions or individual researchers. The new trend has shown that impact measures are in the verge of acceptance as new method for measurement of academic and research contributions. One notable example for this is altmetrics. In the nutshell the paper gives an overview of the emerging trends and impact measuring techniques used in webometrics research.",50,,,http://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/srels/article/view/3379,http://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/srels/article/view/3379,0,,,1489451529,,,0

Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products in the social web. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians examining both their own use of online platforms and the use of their papers on social reference managers. As expected, coverage varied: 82 % of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28 % were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation counts. We conducted a survey among the participants of the STI2012 participants. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68 % of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72 % valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.",101,,,https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11192-013-1221-3.pdf http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1304.html#abs-1304-7300 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-013-1221-3 http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.7300.pdf https://crc.ebsi.umontreal.ca/en/publications/coverage-and-adoption-of-altmetrics-sources-in-the-bibliometric-community/ https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-013-1221-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-013-1221-3,0,,10.1007/s11192-013-1221-3,2038196424,,004-654-014-694-807; 004-924-180-697-031; 006-018-730-429-356; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-813-208-836-925; 015-700-245-441-595; 018-246-118-548-105; 019-265-590-591-246; 023-898-989-623-283; 049-905-673-769-223; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-548-921-979-744; 055-788-708-180-492; 057-286-311-076-534; 058-238-890-202-143; 064-509-241-094-364; 066-507-313-507-599; 071-615-277-709-925; 075-563-711-739-195; 080-264-018-027-22X; 085-625-353-485-714; 086-809-706-245-39X; 093-004-530-053-970; 097-560-061-216-214; 102-276-478-923-871; 109-675-555-908-388; 113-557-566-001-586; 122-353-860-287-425; 129-098-062-346-311; 133-309-543-077-580; 138-732-872-483-934; 141-134-741-084-026; 163-595-480-871-354; 165-270-789-002-269; 177-787-582-091-521; 189-638-011-101-462,149

A esse respeito, naquela oportunidade, destaquei ainda a relevância, bem como potenciais ganhos compartilhados da abertura dos dados e materiais utilizados nas pesquisas publicadas, como meio de inibir fraudes, permitir a reproducibilidade de resultados, aumentar o interesse da comunidade pelos trabalhos publicados e, ainda, promover a reducao de esforcos redundantes no trabalho de pesquisa (tal como agencias de fomento, como a Capes (2018) e a Fapesp tem discutido no âmbito brasileiro).Ainda no mesmo editorial, discuti a relevância do uso de midias sociais como meio de comunicacao de resultados de pesquisa. A RAC, seguindo sua tradicao de acompanhar movimentos contemporâneos da comunidade cientifica, recentemente passou a buscar reportar o nivel de impacto dos documentos publicados. Determinadas plataformas concentram-se em certas metricas de altimetria. Para tanto, existe um conjunto diverso de plataformas como: PloS Article Level Metrics, Nature Communications Metrics, Altmetric, Plum Analytics, ScienceCard, PaperCritic, entre outras. Uma das mais proeminentes e a Plum Analytics (Ortega, 2018a), cujo significado central de mensuracao encontra-se representado na Figura 1 adiante.Conforme Dante Cid, Vice-Presidente de Relacoes Academicas da Elsevier para a America Latina, em palestra proferida durante o encontro denominado Associacao Brasileira de Editores Cientificos (ABEC), na Universidade de Sao Paulo, no mes de setembro deste ano de 2018, metricas ja impactam nao apenas os periodicos, mas tambem os autores e os artigos. No caso dos autores, o indice H, bem como o numero de citacoes recebidas, sao exemplos de indicadores de impacto. Ja no nivel dos artigos existem metricas emergentes: o numero de citacoes; Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI), que leva em consideracao a area de conhecimento, permitindo comparabilidade em escala mundial; e, particularmente, nas ciencias aplicadas, existe especial preocupacao com o impacto social.

In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users’ activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year.

Yet, little is known about the altmetric impact of research fields in the humanities. Consequently, this paper analyses the altmetric coverage and impact of humanities-oriented articles and books published by Swedish universities during 2012. Some of the most common altmetric sources are examined using a sample of 310 journal articles and 54 books. Mendeley has the highest coverage of journal articles (61 %) followed by Twitter (21 %) while very few of the publications are mentioned in blogs or on Facebook. Books, on the other hand, are quite often tweeted while both Mendeley's and the novel data source Library Thing's coverage is low. Many of the problems of applying bibliometrics to the humanities are also relevant for altmetric approaches; the importance of non-journal publications, the reliance on print as well the limited coverage of non-English language publications. However, the continuing development and diversification of methods suggests that altmetrics could evolve into a valuable tool for assessing research in the humanities.",101,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:703046 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1261-3 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2678190 http://hb.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:869911/FULLTEXT01 https://core.ac.uk/display/153185125 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-014-1261-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-014-1261-3,0,,10.1007/s11192-014-1261-3,2022428934,,009-303-522-533-513; 010-057-293-861-47X; 017-349-318-774-487; 019-457-587-825-722; 024-922-550-231-877; 028-593-154-415-675; 045-538-349-555-146; 053-891-289-549-912; 054-802-232-146-783; 059-112-485-872-138; 065-813-744-561-991; 072-207-491-450-460; 073-628-617-778-798; 077-595-428-639-93X; 086-809-706-245-39X; 099-345-549-137-510; 110-566-203-064-997; 139-651-430-124-012; 139-789-903-480-992; 141-134-741-084-026; 143-804-082-399-413; 177-787-582-091-521,94

The study, by analyzing 2.63 million scientific tweeters’ data that are extracted from the Altmetric.com company dataset, is aimed to reveal their productivity and geographic distribution in a comprehensive way. To gain a more in-depth understanding of their account types and identities, 1468 scientific tweeters of different levels of activeness are sampled for further analysis. Our results show that: (1) The extent to which a small proportion of tweeters have posted most of scientific tweets increases over time. In 2016, 10% of scientific tweeters have posted 80% of scientific tweets; (2) Scientific tweeters are widely distributed around the world but in a different pattern with the distribution of general Twitter users. In addition, scientific tweeters are found to be more active in tweeting scientific products than retweeting them in certain areas. (3) Manual coding of the sampled tweeters shows that the percentage of bot accounts among scientific tweeters is 1.8%, which is much lower than that among general Twitter users. Moreover, 73% of scientific tweeters use Twitter for professional purpose, 76% use real names for their accounts, and 16% are institutional accounts. (4) Identities of scientific tweeters are diversified. 49% of them are researchers among which university faculty is the major type, and 38% of them are the general public.

Our results confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications, with 15%-24% of the publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrating in the most recent publications, although their presence is increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences, humanities and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same concept of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly cited publications than journal citation scores. Altmetrics scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are able to identify highly cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation.",66,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.4321 https://128.84.21.199/abs/1401.4321 https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4321,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23309,0,,10.1002/asi.23309,2953055063; 2164277894,,001-987-746-391-998; 003-254-479-923-236; 005-893-127-733-440; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-408-397-359-312; 015-270-923-005-163; 028-800-911-277-740; 034-980-542-520-829; 041-464-618-505-813; 043-495-392-935-371; 049-316-012-536-347; 053-086-790-955-429; 054-802-232-146-783; 057-286-311-076-534; 064-509-241-094-364; 066-507-313-507-599; 072-463-767-991-704; 081-831-333-395-625; 086-809-706-245-39X; 105-040-732-032-838; 110-457-195-877-695; 117-109-843-318-28X; 122-353-860-287-425; 141-134-741-084-026; 146-733-369-353-088; 149-086-710-081-997; 193-428-859-757-927,274

Patino-Sutton,"<jats:p>OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The use of digital practices and approaches can potentially increase the quality and efficiency of all phases of the traditional clinical translational research (CTR) process. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe key stakeholders’ perspectives on the need to: (A) formalize training in digital practices and approaches among CTR trainees; and (B) develop an aligned educational framework that defines core competencies, educational methods, and evaluation metrics. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Participants (n=66) were recruited via email from June to November 2017 using purposive and snowball sampling methods across 4 groups: (1) English speaking national and international experts from academic and private sector institutions with working experience in using digital practices and approaches in research (n=36), (2) CTR educators (n=8), (3) CTR trainees (n=13), and (4) Members of the Southern California Clinical and Translational Science Institute at the University of Southern California (n=9). Online focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured, open-ended interview guide through Google Hangouts and a conference call interface. Sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and 2 research team members performed independent content analyses to identify before and emergent themes using an inductive analytic approach. Kappa was calculated for inter-rater agreement and repeated until agreement was at least 0.70. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Participants’ average age (41.2 yrs, SD 9.26), gender (59% females), non-Hispanic (97%), race (72% White), and doctoral degree (67%). In total, 85% reported experience in teaching digital practices and approaches in research, although 70% were currently not teaching in this field. Participants reported that complementary teaching in digital practices and approaches across the 15 Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) CTR competency areas was relevant, especially in literature review, research implementation, statistical approaches, biomedical informatics, regulatory support, responsible conduct of research, scientific communication, translational teamwork, cross-disciplinary training, leadership, and community engagement; and less so in literature critique, study design, sources of error, and cultural diversity. Additional competencies were identified, for example, online study recruitment, crowdfunding, team and project management, scholarly impact metrics (Altmetrics), ethical and regulatory guidance for conducting research using digital approaches. Five main educational practices were identified including online training sessions, flexible on-demand modules, in-person consultations and training, and project-oriented hands-on workshops. Among the identified challenges were the need for clear metrics in order to evaluate such a training program. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: There was consistent support for a structured program to help CTR trainees to develop competency in digital research practices and approaches. Our results indicate that an education program focused on digital practices and approaches should include a step-wise approach to meet different research and training goals, allowing attendees to increase their awareness and specialized hands-on practical experience.</jats:p>",2,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2059866118002200,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cts.2018.220,0,,10.1017/cts.2018.220,2901269688,,,0

LeGrande et al outlined far less elaborated models in 20074 and 2009,5 and Magnusson and Currow6 argued for a ‘no frills’ version in 2013, which focused on children not adults. I criticised this for some misconceptions but mainly because children's tobacco consumption represents 99.5% of all tobacco products would be hardly worth the lobbying effort necessary to see such a proposal argued publicly and eventually legislated.; ; The 2012 paper2 has received a good deal of attention, with an Altmetric (http://www.altmetric.com) score of 193, 34 citations and 21 234 views as at 11 February 2016. Daniel Halliday's contribution8 to the discussion of the ethics of the concept of the smoker's licence is welcome. However, his conceptions contain many problems, which I now highlight.; ; His paper is organised largely around the curious assumption that a smoker's licence should be considered ‘as a replacement for sales tax on tobacco products’ rather than as an additional component of broad, comprehensive tobacco control policy and practice. The main elements of such policy are well known and set out in the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2003 and now ratified by 180 nations.9 Comprehensive tobacco control consists of public awareness campaigns on the health risks of smoking, taxation designed to reduce consumption, bans on all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion, …",42,Ethics; Humans; Licensure; Smoking,,https://jme.bmj.com/content/42/5/288 https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/42/5/288.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2016-103446,0,26960351,10.1136/medethics-2016-103446,2293583784,,001-818-060-720-77X; 002-389-768-008-837; 004-714-600-653-778; 006-633-780-095-803; 013-554-675-864-04X; 024-287-851-436-059; 038-923-642-720-486; 040-188-106-784-738; 059-412-218-465-970; 060-307-376-273-705; 079-035-365-652-623; 137-205-487-414-309,0

Israel Martínez-López; Samantha Barrón-González; Alejandro Martínez López,"There is a large amount of Information Technology and Communication (ITC) tools that surround scholar activity. The prominent place of the peer-review process upon publication has promoted a crowded market of technological tools in several formats. Despite this abundance, many tools are unexploited or underused because they are not known by the academic community. In this study, we explored the availability and characteristics of the assisting tools for the peer-reviewing process. The aim was to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the tools available at this time, and to hint at new trends for further developments. The result of an examination of literature assisted the creation of a novel taxonomy of types of software available in the market. This new classification is divided into nine categories as follows: (I) Identification and social media, (II) Academic search engines, (III) Journal-abstract matchmakers, (IV) Collaborative text editors, (V) Data visualization and analysis tools, (VI) Reference management, (VII) Proofreading and plagiarism detection, (VIII) Data archiving, and (IX) Scientometrics and Altmetrics.

Participants No participants were involved in this study. Main outcome measure Proportion of contents highlighting the increased risk of mortality and critical to the author’s interpretation of the results. Results We identified 425 items reported by seven sources; 164 (39%) disseminated the authors’ interpretation via an electronic link or a reference, with no additional text. Among 81 items (19 %), the message favoured prolonged treatment and consequently overstated the article conclusions. Among 119 items (28 %), the text was uncertain about the benefit of prolonged treatment but was reported with no or inappropriate mention of increased risk of mortality. Only 34 items (8 %) were uncertain about the benefit of prolonged treatment and mentioned increased risk of mortality. In all, 27 items (6 %) did not favour prolonged treatment, and only 12 of these (3 %) clearly raised some concerns about the reporting of increased risk of death.

Metodologia: Estudo piloto, caracterizado como exploratório, tendo como foco de análise a repercussão do artigo de acesso aberto com o maior indicador altmétrico (n=2.728) para o ano de 2015, segundo divulgado pela Altmetric.com em seu ranking “Top 100”. A qualificação da atenção online é descrita pelas mídias mais expressivas (Twitter e Facebook) em uma amostra randômica (n=10%) para a qual se procedeu a análise de conteúdo e para caracterização do perfil dos grupos sociais que interagirame a categorização dos tipos de conteúdos de interação. Resultado: A forma mais comum de disseminação observada foi o de compartilhamento e repasse para o Twitter (62%) e Facebook (45%), seguido das categorias “conclusivo” (16% e 25%) e argumentativo (15% e 9,6%). O perfil dos usuários responsáveis pela circulação do artigo indica se tratar de especialistas da área da saúde.Conclusão: Embora a altmetria proponha uma avaliação de impacto mais social e democrático da pesquisa científica os colégios virtuais caracterizados indicam um público especializado e o debate e circulação da informação científica sobre o artigo analisado se concentra na comunidade científica.Palavras-chave: Comunicação científica.

While peer review and bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics.

Spezi,"In this paper we present the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis of eleven open-access mega-journals (OAMJs). OAMJs are a relatively recent phenomenon, and have been characterised as having four key characteristics: large size; broad disciplinary scope; a Gold-OA business model; and a peer-review policy that seeks to determine only the scientific soundness of the research rather than evaluate the novelty or significance of the work. Our investigation focuses on four key modes of analysis: journal outputs (the number of articles published and changes in output over time); OAMJ author characteristics (nationalities and institutional affiliations); subject areas (the disciplinary scope of OAMJs, and variations in sub-disciplinary output); and citation profiles (the citation distributions of each OAMJ, and the impact of citing journals). We found that while the total output of the eleven mega-journals grew by 14.9% between 2014 and 2015, this growth is largely attributable to the increased output of Scientific Reports and Medicine. We also found substantial variation in the geographical distribution of authors. Several journals have a relatively high proportion of Chinese authors, and we suggest this may be linked to these journals’ high Journal Impact Factors (JIFs). The mega-journals were also found to vary in subject scope, with several journals publishing disproportionately high numbers of articles in certain sub-disciplines. Our citation analsysis offers support for Bjork & Catani’s suggestion that OAMJs’s citation distributions can be similar to those of traditional journals, while noting considerable variation in citation rates across the eleven titles. We conclude that while the OAMJ term is useful as a means of grouping journals which share a set of key characteristics, there is no such thing as a “typical” mega-journal, and we suggest several areas for additional research that might help us better understand the current and future role of OAMJs in scholarly communication.",11,Bibliometrics; Medicine; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Science,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5115662/ https://core.ac.uk/display/46580539 https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/23452 http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/106066/ http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165359 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165359 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27861511 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Open-access_mega-journals_a_bibliometric_profile/9505136 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78909891.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165359,0,27861511,10.1371/journal.pone.0165359,2555055705,PMC5115662,006-428-935-304-41X; 009-625-019-533-665; 025-918-178-684-179; 027-013-099-122-73X; 045-111-998-646-619; 048-097-061-292-437; 061-270-925-357-144; 072-520-171-823-599; 073-323-288-412-21X; 073-853-932-812-053; 093-497-672-550-911; 098-013-547-065-819; 102-800-022-023-187; 108-649-558-402-379; 116-545-996-099-174; 124-230-359-997-645; 125-790-470-227-499; 131-676-395-527-878; 134-640-660-760-983; 145-605-646-070-949; 157-045-451-362-450,36

This new topic, popularly known as altmetrics, was first proposed in the Altmetrics manifesto (Priem et al., 2010). Since its proposal, altmetrics has been a concept of difficult definition (Haustein, Bowman & Costas, 2016), even being considered as “a good idea, but a bad name” (Rousseau & Ye, 2013). Altmetrics have been usually related to new metrics around scholarly objects captured through events recorded in online social media platforms (Haustein et al., 2016). However, the large diversity of sources and metrics that fall within the realm of altmetrics has made it hard to come up with a consensus of what can be considered as altmetrics (Haustein et al., 2016).",13,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aopenaccess.leidenuniv.nl%3A1887%2F70246 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1801.html#abs-1801-04437 http://revistas.bnjm.cu/index.php/anales/article/view/4192/3814 http://revistas.bnjm.cu/index.php/anales/article/download/4192/3814 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/6251132/1.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6251132,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aopenaccess.leidenuniv.nl%3A1887%2F70246,0,,,2963113500,,,5

This article builds on the authors’ experience during the EU project DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) and aims to assist other scientists to develop a successful dissemination strategy to communicate project achievements. We provide a critical review of the different tools used for outreach to our target audiences, from the academia to the policy makers, and the general public, and try to assess their impact. An effective dissemination strategy and plan should have a clear objective, be designed before the start of the project, identify the target groups and define the methods or tools to be used according to target groups and objectives. The DEVOTES dissemination strategy included two complementary approaches of communication with stakeholders: (i) traditional (e.g. peer reviewed publications, stakeholders workshops and participation in scientific conferences), and (ii) new (e.g. social networks, smartphone applications) media tools. For each dissemination approach, we defined production targets (e.g. number of articles to be published, individual visitors on the website, etc.) to be achieved by the end of the project, and impact measurements (e.g., citation indices for peer reviewed articles) to monitor the successful implementation of DEVOTES Dissemination. This allowed us to identify which tools had been more (e.g. website) or less useful and relevant (e.g. Facebook) during the project. We conclude that impact measurements cannot be easily identified for all dissemination actions. However, for those that were possible, the DEVOTES dissemination targets were successfully achieved. Overall, the use of the tools and activities outlined in this article, combined with the constant evaluation of the dissemination goals throughout the project duration and the assessment of the effectiveness of the different tools, is essential for the achievement of an effective and timely communication of research results.",3,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82832700 http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fmars.2016.00168/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2016.00168/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2016.00168/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82832700.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2016.00168,0,,10.3389/fmars.2016.00168,2515854380,,002-212-228-152-965; 002-247-219-752-213; 006-689-850-657-705; 011-852-535-315-869; 012-548-635-300-218; 015-877-689-868-067; 017-141-468-481-45X; 018-262-753-262-093; 018-378-179-509-294; 019-520-666-760-17X; 019-578-744-535-122; 020-104-854-328-862; 020-553-049-562-107; 022-805-258-212-50X; 023-433-737-931-60X; 025-217-020-962-915; 031-147-560-437-552; 034-171-490-691-342; 044-001-879-479-877; 049-063-532-770-820; 050-252-270-491-60X; 051-588-463-253-320; 061-383-314-250-584; 066-340-205-099-389; 069-022-787-019-937; 087-206-745-835-302; 090-741-145-756-363; 092-281-692-839-369; 097-253-701-803-952; 098-594-181-020-541; 110-329-460-310-977; 123-371-472-665-899; 199-270-615-371-252,4

For each title, we extracted the number of characters in the title, the number of uncommon words, and whether the title was declarative. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for a prespecified baseline confounder (open access). Results One hundred eight “Medical and health sciences” articles were retrieved in the 2013–2015 “Altmetric Top 100” and matched to 216 control articles. Titles of the “Altmetric Top 100” articles were 102.6 characters (±42) long, included 3.4 (±2.0) uncommon words, and 29.6% (32/108) were “declarative.” Titles of the matched articles were 109.3 characters (±37.1) long, included 4.7 (±2.4) uncommon words, and 21.8% (47/216) were “declarative.” After multivariate adjustment, declarative titles with a lower number of uncommon words were significantly more represented in the Altmetric list, with declarative titles having 2.8 times the odds of being in the top list (OR: 2.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 6.4). For each additional uncommon word in the title, there was a 1.4 increase in the odds of being a non-Altmetric Top 100 article (1.4; 1.2–1.6).

We investigate the digital presence of scholars at different academic Web sites. With new technologies, creating profiles, disseminating and exchanging ideas is easily done, and scholars are more likely to attend the networks and impact their community. In our study we compare research profiles of employees at the University of Bergen at five different academic network sites. The sites are ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Google Scholar, ResearcherID and ORCID. CRIStin, the Current Research Information System in Norway (www.cristin.no), is used as a reference value. CRIStin is a national database which contains quality-assured data on scientific publications including supplementary author details such as age, gender, position and affiliation. All investigated sites have varying scopes (and degree of control), but also common features which are worth to investigate and compare. Data is collected using Web scraping applications developed at the University of Bergen Library by searching for the researchers that are affiliated with the University of Bergen.  This was achieved by analyzing the Document Object Model (DOM) of every academic site and then building up a set of selectors and expressions, so that the DOM could be traversed programmatically and indicators extracted. Author recognition is then done by comparing names given in the services with names in CRIStin. After extensive data cleansing and deduplication we were able to compare the different services. Our first goal is to determine number of profiles and degree of overlap. The overlap tells us whether scholars are willing to maintain their profiles at several services. Preference of platform in regard to faculty affiliation, position and age is another aspect of our investigation. Further, we analyze extracted indicators in regard to traditional bibliometric and “altmetric” measures. Bibliometric measures are related to publications and citations, while “altmetric” indicators comprise different forms of Web activities such as followers, following, views and downloads. The indicators vary from service to service, and a correlation analysis tells us whether indicators are related to each other or not. We find that about 37% of researchers at the University of Bergen have at least one profile. They are reluctant to maintain several profiles and overlap was therefore relatively small. Age is a poor predictor of web site use, and women are underrepresented on the investigated platforms. The representation is highest at the Faculty of Psychology and the Faculty of Social Sciences (> 40%). Available indicators show high correlation within bibliometric indicators, but correlation is weak with social and activity indicators across platforms.",,,,https://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/SCS/article/download/3668/3561 https://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/SCS/article/view/3668/0,http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/5.3668,0,,10.7557/5.3668,2256692476,,,0

First, Chinese and American OA journals are taken as an example. Second, combining traditional citation indicators with altmetrics indicators, a process of influence evaluation and comparison model on Chinese and American OA journals is constructed. Third, an evaluation indicator system of OA journals from two dimensions of academic influence and societal influence is constructed too. Lastly, through normalization, correlation analysis, reliability analysis, validity analysis, factor analysis and two-dimensional analysis, the academic and societal influence of OA journals are evaluated and compared between China and USA. It is found that in terms of academic influence and societal influence, the evaluation scores of international OA journals are quite different between China and USA. The influence of the USA is far greater than that of China. The results show a strong positive correlation among the 7 traditional citation indicators based on JCR, and a high positive correlation among the 8 altmetrics indicators based on Altmetrics Explorer, and the indicators have a significant consistency both overall and internal. There is a highly positive correlation between academic influence and societal influence scores for the Chinese and American OA journals. Overall, the results confirm that the evaluation of societal influence of OA journals is used as supplement to the evaluation of academic influence. Altmetrics is also a powerful tool to measure the societal influence of OA journals, but it cannot replace the traditional citation indicators at present.",120,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-019-03159-z https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v120y2019i3d10.1007_s11192-019-03159-z.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03159-z,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03159-z,2954073299,,001-057-048-869-957; 001-405-292-354-662; 002-408-408-957-300; 003-831-478-166-170; 003-853-779-175-473; 007-446-858-302-247; 009-595-058-728-444; 010-418-270-613-554; 010-474-157-259-115; 010-537-281-905-239; 011-077-936-171-179; 012-717-760-048-191; 015-672-068-306-222; 015-755-520-290-700; 018-571-690-695-842; 024-441-694-339-257; 024-491-347-287-793; 030-330-177-745-965; 030-826-034-779-470; 031-782-150-172-945; 033-268-090-262-287; 034-681-222-096-635; 037-927-929-739-434; 039-146-714-777-880; 044-601-980-288-986; 049-658-704-219-991; 050-664-965-270-417; 052-705-330-546-775; 059-548-336-376-963; 060-355-123-421-980; 060-893-989-650-547; 061-973-752-492-962; 064-860-074-300-156; 067-655-416-840-66X; 069-390-143-586-636; 070-935-441-412-784; 074-521-494-268-582; 074-615-908-450-710; 080-311-013-897-911; 083-595-537-541-189; 086-570-249-932-87X; 090-897-784-353-430; 091-008-418-033-625; 091-188-157-482-270; 092-132-106-998-377; 093-652-902-054-364; 096-586-906-697-232; 096-665-719-359-719; 096-931-343-681-070; 098-173-749-418-937; 103-004-964-289-957; 114-774-084-549-589; 127-458-994-664-604; 130-446-333-613-121; 136-271-474-878-277; 167-689-186-031-509; 188-144-860-850-795; 192-127-317-868-707,0

We set out to analyse and visualise the bibliometric characteristics of highly tweeted articles. Methods Twitter mentions were extracted from the Altmetric database. Bibliometric data were obtained from the Web of Science and analysed by VOSviewer software. Hotspots among highly tweeted articles visualised by keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Bibliographic coupling network analysis was used to find the most influential journals, institutions and countries. Results A total of 20,520 Twitter accounts which shared 93,776 tweets related to 23,686 articles from 91 journals were analysed. The British Dental Journal had the highest number of Twitter mentions related to dental articles. Children, dental caries, and periodontal disease were the hottest topics among the 134 highly tweeted dental articles. @The_BDJ had the highest number of tweets related to dental articles, followed by @Dddent2 and @gary_takacs. @TheBDA had the highest number of followers, followed by @Dddent2 and @The_BDJ. Discussion Ground breaking issues such as genomic medicine, stem cells, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence were not seen among the highly tweeted dental articles. In the 'Twittersphere', some independent scientists are more active than well-known dental organisations and journals. The journals are strongly recommended to be proactive in Twittersphere, to set up their own Twitter profile, and to promote their visibility and social impact by immediately tweeting the articles. Researchers should be alert to the overuse of Twitter in scholarly communications. The Kardashian index will be a useful tool to measure the over/under activity of a researcher on Twitter.",226,Bibliometrics; Child; Dental Caries; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Social Media,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0212-z https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41415-019-0212-z,0,31076699,10.1038/s41415-019-0212-z,2944549708,,000-701-825-394-422; 000-947-764-120-988; 002-010-888-972-998; 002-052-422-936-00X; 002-185-324-105-156; 002-419-645-675-423; 004-837-149-986-673; 005-663-683-355-061; 008-910-706-181-573; 010-134-436-351-642; 013-848-964-561-065; 014-173-572-776-423; 018-785-563-749-960; 018-893-593-725-44X; 019-662-366-465-228; 022-593-134-376-885; 030-233-311-444-30X; 032-094-932-105-517; 032-199-803-573-593; 033-852-335-746-849; 043-093-962-318-390; 043-495-392-935-371; 043-875-449-790-607; 043-926-859-214-140; 045-095-128-463-053; 047-134-478-431-993; 047-436-441-352-101; 048-045-413-653-976; 049-165-020-087-240; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-744-930-738-219; 057-507-928-629-166; 066-329-787-124-275; 066-507-313-507-599; 075-400-986-763-577; 076-058-454-642-665; 079-278-714-415-834; 081-141-059-888-25X; 082-413-982-352-822; 094-049-003-650-605; 099-585-901-648-823; 111-053-642-735-783; 129-896-852-419-737; 130-446-333-613-121; 132-571-748-259-764; 186-429-639-951-411,2

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling was used to discover the topics that the users discussed from the tweets.,Results showed that the demographics of Twitter users who tweeted on psychology and political science are significantly different. Tweets on journal articles in psychology reflected more the impact of scientific research finding on the general public and attracted more attention from the general public than the ones in political science. Disciplinary difference in term of user demographics exists, and thus it is important to take the discipline into consideration for future altmetrics studies.,From this study, researchers or research organizations may have a better idea on who their audiences are, and hence more effective strategies can be taken by researchers or organizations to reach a wider audience and enhance their influence.",43,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/OIR-03-2019-0097/full/html https://www.repository.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/76118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/oir-03-2019-0097,0,,10.1108/oir-03-2019-0097,2900649654,,001-782-826-765-858; 008-143-699-405-14X; 012-270-948-713-933; 015-026-381-259-059; 032-065-827-871-233; 041-648-733-693-182; 041-748-643-164-648; 044-794-989-497-868; 045-095-128-463-053; 052-631-776-174-276; 055-666-201-532-860; 056-191-664-457-297; 057-130-193-591-71X; 058-960-804-221-136; 072-201-632-719-13X; 077-289-265-146-165; 103-386-629-191-553; 111-931-270-936-58X; 139-651-430-124-012; 145-837-941-098-824; 160-127-662-449-676; 162-581-367-313-111,0

ResearchGate combines bibliometrics and altmetrics to create a more comprehensive performance measure for researchers and institutions. The ResearchGate score, the flagship indicator calculated by an undisclosed algorithm, is a metric that measure scientific reputation. In this research, ResearchGate metrics are firstly compared with those that Research Excellence Framework (REF) and Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings to assess the quality of UK universities and global universities respectively. This study then utilizes correlation analysis to examine whether ResearchGate metrics demonstrate effectiveness on the researcher level in comparison with SciVal metrics. For this research, 300 ResearchGate members from the supply chain management field were selected. The results provide empirical evidence that demonstrate that the ResearchGate score can be an effective indicator for measuring individual researcher performance.",55,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215302223 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215302223 https://scholar.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/zh/publications/researchgate-an-effective-altmetric-indicator-for-active-research https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.007 https://www.scilit.net/article/2682def314db349b290d31a4287216e8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.007,0,,10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.007,2173388148,,004-924-180-697-031; 008-150-591-136-318; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-168-316-482-221; 013-286-362-190-621; 021-696-172-742-263; 022-530-485-016-787; 025-055-456-938-175; 028-800-911-277-740; 030-115-813-491-520; 044-560-337-223-237; 045-415-979-959-225; 051-301-788-044-913; 052-090-012-058-700; 067-715-519-706-692; 075-267-966-095-209; 081-003-801-540-333; 088-019-011-262-974; 100-289-091-860-650; 101-752-490-869-458; 107-773-427-002-721; 115-763-857-721-997; 122-073-156-920-876; 122-714-993-407-698; 128-149-526-332-454; 132-388-166-608-244; 132-723-851-457-646; 138-561-175-358-392; 141-134-741-084-026,51

Notably, Twitter was the most popular altmetric resource followed by Facebook and news outlets. Tweets were generally from the United States and United Kingdom. Among top 5% popular Iranian medical articles multiple sclerosis, cancer, and anxiety was hot topics. Conclusions : Iranian biomedical journal editors and research scientists needs to be more dynamic in World Wide Web using social media, post-publication peer review tools, Stack Exchange (Q and A) sites, research highlight tools, Wikipedia, and etc. In spite, more attention to the concept of evidence-based policymaking, by Iranian government along with the health policymakers seems necessary.

Although both have been investigated to discover whether they correlate with article citations, it is not known whether users tend to tweet or save (in Mendeley) the same kinds of articles that they cite. In response, this article compares pairs of articles that are tweeted, saved to a Mendeley library, or cited by the same user, but possibly a different user for each source. The study analyzes 1,131,318 articles published in 2012, with minimum tweeted (10), saved to Mendeley (100), and cited (10) thresholds. The results show surprisingly minor overall overlaps between the three phenomena. The importance of journals for Twitter and the presence of many bots at different levels of activity suggest that this site has little value for impact altmetrics. The moderate differences between patterns of saving and citation suggest that Mendeley can be used for some types of impact assessments, but sensitivity is needed for underlying differences.",69,,,https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24028 https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jinfst/v69y2018i8p959-973.html https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24028 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.24028,0,,10.1002/asi.24028,2804203984,,000-701-825-394-422; 001-731-506-576-898; 004-924-180-697-031; 008-150-591-136-318; 009-989-170-038-218; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-418-270-613-554; 026-563-954-973-421; 028-579-304-744-829; 030-671-248-846-321; 037-326-531-131-863; 039-452-122-358-194; 046-870-311-216-086; 054-802-232-146-783; 054-818-565-070-154; 055-788-708-180-492; 066-058-608-660-901; 066-507-313-507-599; 076-399-144-464-512; 079-278-714-415-834; 102-276-478-923-871; 103-268-627-372-687; 106-598-824-898-46X; 121-011-195-507-937; 130-472-793-008-597; 160-324-154-782-950,4

Design/methodology/approach: This study is quantitative research that was conducted using scientometrics and altmetrics indicators. The research sample consists of LIS classic papers. The papers contain highly cited papers of LIS that are introduced by Google Scholar. The research data have been gathered from Google Scholar, Scopus and Plum Analytics Categories. The data analysis has been done by Excel and SPSS applications. Findings: The data indicate that among the highly cited articles of LIS, the highest score regarding the usage, captures, mentions and social media and the most abundance of citations belong to “Citation advantage of open access articles” and “Usage patterns of collaborative tagging systems.” Based on the results of Spearman statistical tests, there is a positive significant correlation between Google Scholar Citations and all studied indicators. However, only the correlation between Google Scholar Citations with capture metrics (p-value = 0.047) and citation metrics (p-value = 0.0001) was statistically significant. Originality/value: Altmetrics indicators can be used as complement traditional indicators of Scientometrics to study the impact of papers. Therefore, the Altmetrics knowledge of LIS researchers and experts and practicing new studies in this field will be very important. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",20,,,http://eprints.umsha.ac.ir/4823/ https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/PMM-10-2018-0025 https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/PMM-10-2018-0025/full/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/pmm-10-2018-0025,0,,10.1108/pmm-10-2018-0025,2920326645,,004-924-180-697-031; 006-369-072-945-600; 008-150-591-136-318; 010-057-293-861-47X; 016-574-404-432-904; 031-282-472-677-339; 035-964-848-340-165; 042-390-023-586-949; 050-252-270-491-60X; 052-090-012-058-700; 054-182-026-187-352; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-286-311-076-534; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-274-983-408-604; 072-463-767-991-704; 083-304-448-410-627; 095-383-957-236-237; 099-816-321-816-355; 114-569-399-530-919; 123-687-398-098-005; 126-062-861-008-278; 138-411-397-282-780; 150-445-653-788-845; 169-829-696-386-902; 196-040-456-741-208,6

These alternative metrics (altmetrics) still need to be evaluated in order to fully understand their meaning, their benefits and limitations. While several preceding studies concentrate on correlations of altmetrics with classical measures like citations, this study aims at investigating metric-compatibility within altmetrics. For this purpose, 5000 journal articles from six disciplines have been analyzed regarding their metrics with the help of the aggregators PlumX and Altmetric.com. For this set, the highest numbers of events have been recognized regarding Mendeley readers, followed by Twitter and Facebook mentions. Thereby variations considering the aggregators could be observed. Intra-correlations between the metrics across one aggregator have been calculated, as well as inter-correlations for the corresponding metrics across the aggregators. For both aggregators, low to medium intra-correlations could be calculated which shows the diversity of the different metrics. Regarding inter-correlations, PlumX and Altmetric.com are highly consistent concerning Mendeley readers (\(r=0.97\)) and Wikipedia mentions (\(r=0.82\)), whereas the consistency concerning Twitter (\(r=0.49\)), blogs (\(r=0.46\)) and Reddit (\(r=0.41\)) is on a moderate level.

In contrast to the existing research evaluation metrics such as Bibliometrics, Altmetrics or Webometrics, which are based on measuring the number of interactions in the scholarly network, Semantometrics build on the premise that fulltext is needed to understand the value of publications. Using the CORE dataset as a case study, this paper looks at the relation between the semantic distance of authors and their research endogamy value.

Peek, co-founder of the Open Access Directory and associate professor at the Simmons Graduate School of Library and Information Science, scholarly communication through the dissemination of journals was first reported in 1665 (Peek & Newby, 1996, p. 5). However, it took 337 years for the scholarly community to formalize a global initiative declaring research a public good, with unrestricted, free access for everyone. The 2002 Budapest Open Access Initiative ushered in a paradigm shift in the way scholars create and share knowledge. The launch of the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) in 2003 formalized an alternative venue for scholars to publish their work. From 2004 to 2010, the number of titles listed in the DOAJ rose from 1,250 to more than 5,200(Walters & Linvill, 2010, p. 372). Today, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) continues to work as a catalyst for new models of scholarly communication, working in the fields of author rights, digital repositories, and open data.As the model of scholarly communication evolves and shifts, so too has the field of bibliometrics. The Open Citation Project, a joint NSF-JISC International Digital Libraries Research Programme funded initiative, has been analyzing citation counts in open access repositories, impact factors of open access journals, and the role of preprints in the dissemination of knowledge since 1999. The growing field of altmetrics is currently developing alternative models to traditional citation indices, such as the h-index, and beginning to study the role of Zotero and Mendeley within the context of scholarly communication. These new approaches to scholarly metrics are uncovering the broad intellectual networks contributing to a single journal article, well beyond the bibliography. As a corollary, the persistent myth of the lone scholar working in a silent, secluded office surrounded by books and articles is slowly eroding.Academic libraries have been at the center of many of these endeavors, often pushing open access initiatives on their campuses, building digital repositories, hosting Zotero workshops for faculty and students, and assisting scholars in negotiating author rights for their work. Libraries are pivotal nodes in almost every intellectual network. However, even with the development of new metrics in paratextual evaluation, the work of libraries and librarians continues to be obscured. This is because the libraries lurk in the most overlooked paratextual element: the acknowledgement.What this paper argues is that the acknowledgments are a crucial but overlooked aspect of scholarly communication and bibliometrics. Not only would a comprehensive analysis of acknowledgements provide a more accurate description of intellectual networks, further eroding the myth of the lone scholar, but it would also quantify and illuminate the importance of libraries and librarians in the scholarly communication process. As a corollary, tenure-track librarians should include research acknowledgments in tenure and promotion reports in order to demonstrate their contributions to scholarship.History of Paratextual ScholarshipThere has been a growing interest in the paratextual elements of scholarly communication in the last decade. Formal elements of documentation, footnotes and citations in particular, have become the subject of entire treatises on expressions of intellectual debt.(Grafton, 1997; Hauptman, 2008; Zerby, 2002). Marginalia, written comments or annotations in the margins of manuscripts, in addition, have been examined quite thoroughly by H.J. Jackson's Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books (Jackson, 2001). Scholars in this field have largely focused on the functional attributes of paratextual elements as expressions of intellectual debt. As Sir Anthony Grafton writes about the use of footnotes in historical scholarship, ""First, they persuade: they convince the reader that the historian has done an acceptable amount of work, enough to lie within the tolerance of the field. …",,,,http://commons.colgate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=lib_facschol https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/1229/ https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3177&context=libphilprac https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3881006671/much-obliged-analyzing-the-importance-and-impact http://eprints.rclis.org/25428/1/Finnell_Much%20Obliged.pdf http://eprints.rclis.org/25428/,http://commons.colgate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=lib_facschol,0,,,1871311500,,006-783-742-483-737; 024-202-428-499-292; 031-580-605-003-895; 033-411-535-069-412; 043-797-575-547-48X; 049-605-354-775-779; 073-916-406-447-098; 079-570-744-014-677; 084-165-089-825-343; 100-068-332-054-811; 100-172-578-532-334; 126-414-936-681-712; 128-486-564-983-52X; 128-518-301-677-700; 135-621-225-616-250; 153-288-883-565-578; 168-543-443-124-787; 190-732-483-708-680; 196-640-189-925-828; 197-657-667-654-186; 199-587-073-331-787,0

Baidu Baike, a wiki-like online encyclopedia, is analysed as a typical example in which experts and lay Internet users collaborate. Entries in Biomedical Science section are analysed to reveal communication activities behind the construction of such scholarly entries. The composition of the related entries, references of each entry, cooperation among contributors of entries, and common interests of contributors are analysed with Altmetrics, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and heterogeneous coupling. Altmetrics is used to analyse scholarly communication during the construction of entries. Citation analysis based on references in entries provides a way to establish indirect communication between citing and cited authors, namely the contributors of entries and authors of references. Co-occurrence analysis is used for the analysis of cooperation both among experts and lay Internet users and the distribution of tags of entries. Heterogeneous coupling is used to reveal the relationship among entries based on common references as well as common experts. The results show that literature is referred to during people's online communication. The citations and tags of entries reflect the interdisciplinary specializations within Biomedical Science.

A random sample of 300 social sciences blog posts (out of 1,233 blog posts) from ResearchBlogging published between 01/01/2012 to 18/06/2014 subjected to content analysis. An existing categorization scheme was used and modified inductively. The 300 blog posts had 472 references including 424 journal articles from 269 different journals. Sixty-one (%22.68) of all journals cited were from the category of social sciences and most of the journals with high frequency were highly cited general science journals such as PNAS and Science. Seventy-five percent of all journals were referenced only once. The average age of articles cited was 5.8 years. The most frequent (38, %12.67) motivation was to 'neutrally presenting details of a study'. Overall, social science blogs were rather subject-oriented than article- oriented. This means that a considerable number of blog posts were not driven simply by writing about an article, instead bloggers tend to write about their subject of interest and use references to support their argument. The study shows the potential of blog citations as an altmetric measure and as a proxy for assessing the research impact.",30,,,http://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2569-en.html http://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2569-en.pdf https://www.sid.ir/En/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=470224,http://jipm.irandoc.ac.ir/article-1-2569-en.html,0,,,1542424924,,011-044-076-432-98X; 029-186-189-428-511; 036-550-428-112-373; 043-807-526-841-216; 050-252-270-491-60X; 052-645-971-034-989; 072-463-767-991-704; 100-487-663-161-589; 127-458-994-664-604,0

In addition, there are good reasons to qualify statements that altmetrics measure the wider impact of research on society.

Scientists, funders, and organizations are moving the paradigm of ""research publishing"" well beyond traditional articles. The aim is to pursue an holistic approach where publishing includes any product (e.g. publications, datasets, experiments, software, web sites, blogs) resulting from a research activity and relevant to the interpretation, evaluation, and reuse of the activity or part of it. The implementation of this vision is today mainly inspired by literature scientific communication workflows, which separate the ""where"" research is conducted from the ""where"" research is published and shared. In this paper we claim that this model cannot fit well with scientific communication practice envisaged in Science 2.0 settings. We present the idea of Science 2.0 Repositories (SciRepos), which meet publishing requirements arising in Science 2.0 by blurring the distinction between research life-cycle and research publishing. SciRepos interface with the ICT services of research infrastructures to intercept and publish research products while providing researchers with social networking tools for discovery, notification, sharing, discussion, and assessment of research products",21,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37824318.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1045/january2015-assante,0,,10.1045/january2015-assante,,,,7

In addition, it is important to know how to increase visibility of your manuscript because university administrators and funding agencies rely heavily on numerical metrics for decision-making. This presentation will look at the needs that metrics serve and provide an overview of how the dominant metric, the Impact Factor, is determined (along with a discussion of the metric’s flaws).

This study reports on a year-long case study on the implementation of an integrated unit of learning on distance, speed and time, within three second-level schools in Ireland. This study employed a qualitative approach and examined the key aspects of practice that impact on the integration of mathematics and science teaching and learning.

Therefore, different efforts have been made to develop models/measurements to address this issue. In this article we identify the models/measurements of cross-national distance developed since the beginning of the 2000 decade. After briefly presenting each model’s distinctive features, we assess their impact on the research field based on a wide range of bibliometric techniques (direct, indirect, and adjusted citation impacts, altmetrics, academic reviews, journals and publishers’ prestige). Our analysis shows that the narrower cultural distance construct has lost ground to the wider psychic distance one. Furthermore, researchers highly value those models and measurement that go beyond the cultural and psychic distance constructs providing a multidimensional framework to analyze and measure cross-national distance among countries. Our analysis of these models’ impact shows that this a salient issue in the research field as a whole and a central topic in the highest ranked journals in International Business and Management.",121,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-019-03203-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03203-y,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03203-y,2969011170,,000-207-227-285-759; 000-218-200-032-843; 000-913-279-475-915; 002-402-462-805-44X; 005-409-395-948-360; 007-286-828-002-008; 008-998-283-383-315; 009-303-522-533-513; 009-508-139-683-120; 010-057-293-861-47X; 010-484-919-379-295; 010-774-483-573-227; 010-985-966-961-419; 011-708-908-444-609; 013-231-440-030-220; 014-104-681-192-786; 016-479-610-053-133; 017-022-158-416-909; 017-023-043-922-128; 017-204-890-342-418; 017-577-221-726-352; 017-585-409-856-976; 017-836-943-706-98X; 018-586-943-467-517; 021-120-673-715-990; 021-444-004-617-796; 022-047-627-889-39X; 022-957-513-628-282; 025-033-336-373-256; 026-365-650-771-727; 028-593-154-415-675; 029-332-718-001-875; 030-298-410-640-143; 030-826-034-779-470; 031-096-934-224-58X; 032-044-009-710-945; 032-437-995-253-850; 033-396-455-592-892; 033-534-192-327-546; 033-549-187-212-48X; 034-651-237-028-566; 035-733-119-829-149; 036-385-033-572-467; 036-668-487-151-384; 037-265-699-359-347; 038-972-644-224-41X; 039-090-602-197-064; 039-290-766-509-585; 041-914-269-409-246; 041-995-413-669-34X; 042-653-297-701-838; 043-765-363-037-81X; 044-193-335-211-417; 044-301-163-991-554; 044-404-948-423-727; 044-531-085-060-255; 045-130-111-530-070; 045-694-657-451-669; 046-621-506-208-599; 049-097-794-097-512; 050-664-965-270-417; 051-018-805-829-808; 051-210-443-452-360; 051-518-896-574-863; 051-651-080-617-800; 051-965-959-247-371; 052-885-085-415-720; 053-303-482-689-630; 053-469-689-042-762; 053-890-236-468-196; 054-125-314-302-174; 054-221-810-321-366; 055-788-063-462-184; 055-986-643-782-229; 056-164-853-789-692; 056-705-902-281-14X; 059-770-332-819-859; 061-208-056-028-148; 061-829-915-788-770; 063-006-755-229-923; 063-995-471-387-664; 064-420-766-656-39X; 065-101-650-162-660; 065-114-424-971-614; 067-897-343-637-16X; 068-611-137-348-201; 069-497-872-046-744; 071-023-163-005-293; 072-978-121-958-617; 073-670-220-345-870; 074-138-006-317-591; 074-206-717-543-714; 075-723-556-019-314; 075-969-788-682-035; 076-634-750-475-876; 077-694-258-940-116; 079-960-774-328-742; 080-073-025-926-811; 080-671-101-426-449; 080-980-582-763-540; 081-765-078-390-081; 084-947-919-098-277; 085-211-231-477-329; 087-147-154-162-102; 087-967-704-398-931; 090-700-207-154-94X; 092-701-745-851-969; 093-046-058-841-695; 093-774-538-938-221; 093-807-829-570-488; 095-416-199-518-718; 096-524-882-502-870; 097-746-315-931-513; 098-351-410-901-283; 099-318-317-726-953; 099-686-359-751-486; 104-687-356-995-753; 105-796-868-928-959; 108-867-203-853-82X; 109-528-226-541-095; 110-525-069-323-589; 111-583-067-464-910; 113-007-590-297-560; 113-015-644-384-935; 114-179-052-783-526; 115-885-068-380-769; 116-545-813-640-686; 119-662-553-975-51X; 124-264-782-797-937; 127-813-242-419-634; 128-559-918-138-820; 130-446-333-613-121; 133-030-777-651-671; 134-384-379-808-762; 134-607-843-915-672; 138-411-397-282-780; 141-134-741-084-026; 141-378-572-845-138; 143-248-156-769-604; 146-920-588-585-886; 164-444-439-491-753; 174-743-361-740-440; 174-777-347-890-069; 191-756-060-534-773,0

Chisolm,"Abstract Traditionally, scholars focused their efforts in the domains of clinical care, research, and education; however, the last decade has witnessed the rise of novel areas of development such as innovation, quality improvement, informatics, and recently, digital scholarship. Academic institutions adapted and began considering these fields for academic promotion and tenure. Social media has become a critical space for the dissemination of knowledge and outreach to community and policy makers and also for the creation of communities of practice. This new realm brings multiple challenges, such as the appraisal of the quality and appropriateness of the content, the evaluation of impact on the academe and general populations, coupled to the creation of a system to reward scholars engaged in this novel endeavor. In this article, we describe the current state of academic promotion and the definition, nature, and merit of digital scholarship. We outline new strategies and tools for the assessment of dissemination and impact of these works, such as altmetrics, and finally, we reference innovative concepts on how to organize and use this digital academia on career promotion and tenure.",15,,,https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/social-media-scholarship-and-alternative-metrics-for-academic-pro https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144017311341,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2017.09.012,0,,10.1016/j.jacr.2017.09.012,2767483120,,000-859-321-073-633; 001-230-855-524-978; 002-598-151-216-290; 002-959-181-325-747; 004-240-779-711-592; 005-107-493-914-371; 007-255-600-199-885; 009-721-908-661-982; 010-141-385-349-31X; 010-168-316-482-221; 011-539-705-119-668; 011-854-399-312-637; 011-964-986-306-191; 014-255-234-754-300; 015-987-154-174-779; 016-002-314-063-646; 016-338-169-453-427; 017-085-829-673-85X; 017-678-533-882-699; 022-369-698-343-070; 022-415-488-851-186; 031-301-689-003-731; 035-201-117-342-583; 035-800-259-148-481; 035-964-848-340-165; 036-822-044-898-57X; 036-866-495-025-975; 037-049-131-162-481; 039-505-270-645-642; 040-010-339-266-001; 040-084-790-123-832; 040-485-951-631-289; 042-074-188-295-133; 043-004-764-420-549; 050-456-534-802-470; 050-562-977-385-96X; 051-710-296-465-276; 052-129-828-982-897; 054-787-998-463-878; 059-247-458-694-047; 059-416-778-825-610; 060-655-185-563-807; 061-875-362-869-155; 062-800-284-202-59X; 063-958-369-406-82X; 064-817-327-049-569; 065-008-066-094-105; 071-066-711-590-754; 077-265-762-583-386; 083-925-625-829-149; 088-262-427-402-07X; 089-914-448-038-331; 090-994-824-033-330; 091-344-875-586-324; 094-880-924-920-295; 095-231-656-222-04X; 102-973-599-213-44X; 109-140-935-805-814; 113-222-480-436-314; 120-869-060-973-296; 129-814-385-399-826; 135-340-161-856-552; 140-750-789-105-933; 164-233-751-793-174; 190-362-066-549-10X,17

Bowman; Fereshteh Didegah; Mikael Laakso,"Scientific articles available in Open Access (OA) have been found to attract more citations and online attention to the extent that it has become common to speak about OA Altmetrics Advantage. This research investigates how the OA Altmetrics Advantage holds for a specific case of research articles, namely the research outputs from universities in Finland. Furthermore, this research examines disciplinary and platform specific differences in that (dis)advantage. The new methodological approaches developed in this research focus on relative visibility, i.e. how often articles in OA journals receive at least one mention on the investigated online platforms, and relative receptivity, i.e. how frequently articles in OA journals gain mentions in comparison to articles in subscription-based journals. The results show significant disciplinary and platform specific differences in the OA advantage, with articles in OA journals within for instance veterinary sciences, social and economic geography and psychology receiving more citations and attention on social media platforms, while the opposite was found for articles in OA journals within medicine and health sciences. The results strongly support field- and platform-specific considerations when assessing the influence of journal OA status on altmetrics. The new methodological approaches used in this research will serve future comparative research into OA advantage of scientific articles over time and between countries.",,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11192-019-03301-x.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-019-03301-x,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-019-03301-x,0,,,2989484692,,001-757-928-198-829; 010-141-385-349-31X; 012-393-670-757-578; 012-399-872-558-240; 024-266-974-110-718; 025-533-766-736-636; 029-494-384-872-612; 040-474-439-413-561; 042-958-891-403-339; 044-794-989-497-868; 045-095-128-463-053; 046-572-684-065-959; 055-831-901-562-709; 059-545-202-707-321; 065-206-959-926-455; 067-737-723-629-556; 068-636-673-224-780; 085-676-297-104-760; 087-939-306-833-506; 103-475-321-517-806; 121-568-695-886-919; 122-353-860-287-425; 122-459-426-080-507; 145-605-646-070-949; 163-002-268-564-449,0

So, it’s forcing the research community to have some improved and alternate ways to evaluate the impact of those increasing research which are not only confined to and has limited base to the academic citations. Altmetrics, being in its infancy stage has gained lots of interests within the research community in a very short-span of time and has challenged the traditional metrics i.e. citation counts and impact factors.

Being able to answer this question is of great importance in order to appropriately channel efforts and resources in science. The impact by scientists in academia is currently measured by citation based metrics such as h-index, i-index and citation counts. These academic metrics aim to represent the dissemination of knowledge among scientists rather than the impact of the research on the wider world. In this work we are interested in measuring scientific impact beyond academia, on the economy, society, health and legislation (comprehensive impact). Indeed scientists are asked to demonstrate evidence of such comprehensive impact by authoring case studies in the context of the Research Excellence Framework (REF). We first investigate the extent to which existing citation based metrics can be indicative of comprehensive impact. We have collected all recent REF impact case studies from 2014 and we have linked these to papers in citation networks that we constructed and derived from CiteSeerX, arXiv and PubMed Central using a number of text processing and information retrieval techniques. We have demonstrated that existing citation-based metrics for impact measurement do not correlate well with REF impact results. We also consider metrics of online attention surrounding scientific works, such as those provided by the Altmetric API. We argue that in order to be able to evaluate wider non-academic impact we need to mine information from a much wider set of resources, including social media posts, press releases, news articles and political debates stemming from academic work. We also provide our data as a free and reusable collection for further analysis, including the PubMed citation network and the correspondence between REF case studies, grant applications and the academic literature.",12,"Achievement; Biomedical Research/standards; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Models, Statistical; Publishing/statistics & numerical data; Science; Social Media",,https://doaj.org/article/14f450db1e064bafb0cef0e373a31b52 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/87734/ https://paperity.org/p/80298706/measuring-scientific-impact-beyond-academia-an-assessment-of-existing-impact-metrics-and https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173152 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80694977.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173152,0,28278243,10.1371/journal.pone.0173152,2593028313,,001-380-534-927-841; 001-647-844-038-388; 001-731-506-576-898; 006-101-714-460-131; 012-580-761-192-14X; 013-261-296-086-031; 014-523-033-567-291; 022-815-023-314-850; 029-175-246-581-544; 029-827-563-401-085; 043-864-567-887-625; 049-613-473-975-431; 050-371-256-500-33X; 051-965-959-247-371; 056-630-494-000-471; 066-507-313-507-599; 068-128-557-934-813; 076-067-046-336-188; 094-105-003-746-803; 097-088-943-118-521; 101-752-490-869-458; 105-402-220-957-576; 110-457-195-877-695; 127-458-994-664-604; 128-610-192-568-565; 130-446-333-613-121; 132-723-851-457-646; 140-144-550-358-859; 173-176-514-929-582,41

Altmetric and other measurements stratify academic communications according to this alternate, online media presence (not academic penetrance).

Far beyond this trite, patronizing question from the minds of outdated, terrified technophobes, the real impact of “social” media is not narcissistic solipsism. Instant dissemination of contemporary surgical controversies on a truly global level drives improved (or at least reflective) health care for all. While a numerical assignment of value according to views, “likes,” impressions, or “retweets” may seem meaningless to cynical, established academics, the impetus for universal improvement is self-evident.

However, citations have a lag period before the true impact of an article can be determined. The Altmetric score has emerged as a measure of the digital dissemination of a scientific article across multiple platforms, including Tweets, Facebook likes, and other social and popular media mentions. We hypothesized that Altmetric score would correlate with citations and journal IF in pediatric surgery. Methods Using the previously identified 14 core journals of pediatric surgery, the top ten most-cited articles from each of these journals were identified for the year 2012, allowing for 5+ y of follow-up. For each article, we determined the number of times cited and the Altmetric score. For each journal, the 2012 IF and year in which the journal's Twitter account was established were determined. Bibliometric data were collected for the year 2015 to allow comparison of Altmetric scores across years. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined using the GraphPad PRISM software. Results Citation information for n = 140 articles from 2012 to 2015 was obtained. In 2012, articles were cited 56,159 times (median 192, range 21-5029), and the median Altmetric score was 8 (range 0-4261). Citations correlated strongly with journal IF (r = 0.82, P  Conclusions This study is the first to link traditional bibliometric measures with newer measures of digital dissemination for publications in pediatric surgery. Although the Altmetric score of the top cited articles did not correlate with journal IF, it did weakly correlate with citations. Interestingly, this correlation was strongest for journals with well-established Twitter accounts, indicating that, over time, the Altmetric score may emerge as a tool to predict future citations. Currently, Altmetric and traditional bibliometric measures appear to have distinct but complementary roles in measuring dissemination and impact of scientific articles in pediatric surgery.",243,,,https://uthsc.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/correlation-between-altmetric-score-and-citations-in-pediatric-su https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022480419303014 https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/ses/resource/pt/mdl-31154133 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2019.05.010,0,31154133,10.1016/j.jss.2019.05.010,2947778969,,000-558-547-402-568; 006-583-479-646-036; 013-848-964-561-065; 017-509-413-804-883; 024-704-447-017-762; 029-109-928-591-963; 038-000-009-367-239; 038-107-047-654-79X; 050-744-930-738-219; 055-070-550-438-664; 056-672-835-542-654; 063-532-277-943-208; 067-655-416-840-66X; 069-818-078-358-075; 092-132-106-998-377; 098-173-749-418-937; 124-465-127-489-429,3

In order to address this gap in the literature, the author conducted a content analysis of tweets tracked by a metrics aggregator (Plum X Metrics) in a Digital Commons IR. The study found that the majority of tweets were neutral in attitude, intended for a general audience, included no hashtags, and were written by users unaffiliated with the works.

In response, this article uses experimental simulations to assess the correlation strengths to be expected under various different conditions. The results show that the correlation strength reflects not only the underlying degree of association but also the average magnitude of the numbers involved.

BioMed Central is the open access publisher who pioneered this publishing model and has been part of Springer since 2008. We launched our first journal in the year 2000, and have since seen several positive global developments which have helped establish open access as an important trend in the evolvement of scholarly communication.  We have consequently observed a steady increase in awareness of open access and specifically, of our wide range of specialist as well as broad interest titles which is reflected in our growing submission numbers. BioMed Central as one of the main open access publishers has helped to establish open access as a new way of making academic research available to researchers and the public, and to introduce a change of the subscription business model in academic publishing and libraries. While BioMed Central also offers a solution for the Green Route of open access (“Open Repository”) the main part of our publishing activity is centred around our fully or “gold” open access journals. BioMed Central and SpringerOpen practise the “author pays” model, whereby the author is asked to pay a fee to cover the publisher’s cost of publishing and distributing the article. While the awareness of open access is growing among the academics, there is still uncertainty among many of how open access works and why they are asked to pay a fee. To cover that fee can still be a major obstacle for a researcher attempting to publish an article in an open access journal, as the SOAP report stated in 2011. I will present an analysis of the most recent open access developments and studies globally; as well as the effect that this has had on a number of factors that play a role in scholarly publishing, such as Impact Factors, citations and awareness of open access among academics. I will give an update on BioMed Central and Springer’s own development in the arena of open access and visibility of research, including  experimenting with alternative methods of evaluating research such as Altmetric and the SCImago Journal & Country Rank.  I will conclude with an overview of how we are working with research organisations and universities to offer financial support to their researchers in order to cover the fee for publishing in BioMed Central and SpringerOpen journals in the context of our institutional membership program.",,,,https://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/SCS/article/download/3224/3072 https://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/SCS/article/download/3224/3072,http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/5.3224,0,,10.7557/5.3224,2112702631,,,0

Teixeira da Silva,"The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of China has set forth ambitious goals, as part of its Citation Impact Upgrading Plan (CIUP), to fortify the standing of Chinese academics as well as Chinese academic journals. At present, MOST primarily considers Clarivate Analytics journal impact factor (JIF), which is a proprietary scientometric measure, as a measure of ""quality"". Academic publishing is however, starting to move away from metrics such as the JIF that can be gamed, and that do not truly reflect the academic worth of individual scientists, or of journals. Metrics such as altmetrics, which show the paper's popularity among social media, or a greater balance of metrics, to buffer the monopolized impact of the JIF on metrics-based rewards systems, may be issues that China and MOST need to consider as global academic publishing tends towards a state of open science where open access journals that reach a wider audience may have greater value than journals with a high JIF. Not only are China's academics well-funded by the state, the Chinese academic market is a highly coveted market by publishers and other parties interested in advancing their academic or commercial interests. Given the current fluid and rapidly evolving state of academic publishing, and the fairly rigid JIF-based rewards system in place in China at the moment, coupled with a recent spate in academic misconduct from Chinese researchers, this letter offers some suggestions as to the need for China to rethink its policies regarding what factors influence academic rewards.",112,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2430-y https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v112y2017i3d10.1007_s11192-017-2430-y.html https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3129976,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2430-y,0,,10.1007/s11192-017-2430-y,2624929849,,006-365-365-827-482; 008-723-239-340-841; 010-141-385-349-31X; 015-820-881-271-482; 018-622-032-956-219; 027-459-970-277-852; 033-456-040-937-192; 036-217-832-729-19X; 070-599-924-880-048; 074-016-498-278-377; 079-797-726-196-08X; 111-109-569-679-649; 118-003-632-018-181; 155-103-324-875-456,9

We examined this issue empirically, by testing unidimensionality and the component structure congruence of the five ‘key’ AAS components: News, Blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. As a reference point, these tests were also done on different citation data: WoS, Scopus, and Google Scholar. All tests were done for groups of articles with: (1) high citations, but lower AAS (HCGs), and (2) high AAS, but lower citations (HAGs). Changes in component structures over time (from 2016 to 2017) were also considered. Citation data consistently formed congruent unidimensional structures for all groups and over time. Altmetric data formed congruent unidimensional structures only for the HCGs, with much inconsistency for the HAGs (including change over time). The relationship between Twitter and News counts was shown to be curvilinear. It was not possible to obtain a satisfactory congruent and reliable linear unidimensional altmetric structure between the groups for any variable combination, even after Mendeley and CiteULike altmetric counts were included. Correlations of altmetric aggregates and citations were fairly inconsistent between the groups. We advise against the usage of composite altmetric measures (including the AAS) for any group comparison purposes, until the measurement invariance issues are dealt with. The underlying pattern of associations between individual altmetrics is likely too complex and inconsistent across conditions to justify them being simply aggregated into a single score.",114,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/scient/v114y2018i1d10.1007_s11192-017-2559-8.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11192-017-2559-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2559-8,0,,10.1007/s11192-017-2559-8,2765846130,,002-005-704-603-316; 002-181-962-982-139; 002-666-995-736-984; 003-034-665-176-76X; 003-078-576-803-447; 009-303-522-533-513; 010-099-397-086-59X; 016-194-103-803-199; 016-334-794-759-191; 019-120-240-188-628; 021-120-673-715-990; 021-696-172-742-263; 025-651-618-918-232; 026-365-650-771-727; 026-734-228-627-464; 028-246-623-651-27X; 033-098-799-174-568; 042-993-329-662-775; 043-495-392-935-371; 049-316-012-536-347; 050-991-241-400-827; 051-701-556-494-31X; 054-594-383-964-19X; 054-802-232-146-783; 055-831-901-562-709; 057-535-106-748-252; 066-507-313-507-599; 067-704-690-865-884; 077-252-192-140-934; 080-205-020-568-703; 080-458-057-611-336; 090-215-153-897-959; 093-664-234-944-828; 098-239-524-422-432; 100-386-006-000-192; 100-436-172-024-424; 102-208-516-329-634; 105-388-180-260-388; 109-316-119-853-662; 110-457-195-877-695; 114-053-132-141-159; 119-895-574-809-059; 122-073-156-920-876; 145-605-646-070-949; 153-376-062-165-585; 174-327-007-763-401,1

Flatt; Alessandro Blasimme; Effy Vayena,"Who among the many researchers is most likely to usher in a new era of scientific breakthroughs? This question is of critical importance to universities, funding agencies, as well as scientists who must compete under great pressure for limited amounts of research money. Citations are the current primary means of evaluating one’s scientific productivity and impact, and while often helpful, there is growing concern over the use of excessive self-citations to help build sustainable careers in science. Incorporating superfluous self-citations in one’s writings requires little effort, receives virtually no penalty, and can boost, albeit artificially, scholarly impact and visibility, which are both necessary for moving up the academic ladder. Such behavior is likely to increase, given the recent explosive rise in popularity of web-based citation analysis tools (Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Altmetric) that rank research performance. Here, we argue for new metrics centered on transparency to help curb this form of self-promotion that, if left unchecked, can have a negative impact on the scientific workforce, the way that we publish new knowledge, and ultimately the course of scientific advance.",5,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jpubli/v5y2017i3p20-d106517.html https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/improving-the-measurement-of-scientific-success-by-reporting-a-se https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/5/3/20/pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/publications5030020 http://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/5/3/20/htm https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/5/3/20,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/publications5030020,0,,10.3390/publications5030020,2740789543,,013-123-944-981-275; 025-055-456-938-175; 027-250-286-814-642; 037-331-683-577-73X; 040-872-345-839-696; 045-264-920-461-232; 050-371-256-500-33X; 064-264-695-662-36X; 079-210-534-470-560; 080-347-235-705-975; 101-752-490-869-458; 115-207-974-449-139; 119-623-881-970-943; 129-896-852-419-737,9

A mathematical algorithm which incorporates weighted values of the roles within the peer review process is created. The h-index, which is a value that “measures the productivity and impact of a scientist or scholar,” is also incorporated. Each round of review is weighted using the square root as later rounds of peer review are often less rigorous than earlier rounds. Once a paper is accepted the calculation is conducted and a “peer review evaluation” metric, or “Peer Review Evaluation Score” (pre-SCORE) is available. It is clear that such a metric would prove beneficial to all engaged parties (authors, publishers, readers, libraries). Authors will know that their work is being evaluated by a trustworthy publication and by experts in their field. Legitimate, ethical publishers will be recognized as such. Readers would have the ability to filter out material which was not properly vetted, and libraries/consortia would have further assurance that their limited funds are spent wisely. Future studies to see if there is a correlation between the pre-SCORE and Impact Factor or highly cited material is possible.

Results : the analysis was conducted on 107 studies dealing with citations, downloads and social impact. Sixty-seven of them simply employed the counting citations to OA and non-OA articles; nineteen articles compared the downloads and citations counts; and twenty-one articles investigated the social impact of OA articles. Twenty-five articles investigated the citations, download counts, and social impact of medical articles. Conclusions : The studies investigating the citation impact mostly showed citation advantages. Those that employed citation and download counts of medical articles using randomized controlled trials showed that OA articles were downloaded significantly more frequently, but found no evidence of a citation advantage for open access articles. The citation advantage from open access might be caused by other factors.

It consists of two Social Media Editors (Junior and Senior) and a team of volunteer medical students and residents to assist their work. Collaborative promotional agreements were developed to promote <jats:italic>CJEM</jats:italic> articles on the Skeptics’ Guide to Emergency Medicine (SGEM) podcast through the ‘Hot off the Press’ (HOP) series and the CanadiEM blog through an infographic series. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> ;                <jats:italic>CJEM</jats:italic> papers were selected for promotion by the Team based on their perceived interest to the online community of emergency physicians. Altmetric scores, which are a measure of online dissemination derived from a weighted algorithm of social media metrics, were collated for articles promoted using the SGEM HOP or CanadiEM blogs. A control group was created using the articles with the top two Altmetric scores in each <jats:italic>CJEM</jats:italic> issue in 2015 and 2016. Erratum, Letters, and articles written by the social media editors were excluded from the control groups. The success of the social media promotion was quantified through the measurement of Altmetric scores as of January 1, 2017. Unpaired two-tailed <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>-tests with unequal variance were used to test for significant differences. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> 106 and 82 eligible articles were published in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Four articles in 2015 and two articles in 2016 were excluded from the control groups because they were written by the social media editors. SGEM HOP podcasts promoted one article in 2015 and five articles in 2016. CanadiEM infographics promoted three articles in 2015 and eight articles in 2016. No articles were promoted in both series. The average Altmetric score was higher for SGEM HOP (61.0) than CanadiEM Infographics (31.5, p&amp;lt;0.04), 2015 controls (15.8, p&amp;lt;0.01), and 2016 controls (13.6, p&amp;lt;0.01). The average Altmetric score for CanadiEM Infographics was higher than 2015 controls (p&amp;lt;0.04) and 2016 controls (p&amp;lt;0.02). There was no significant difference between the control groups. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The results suggest that collaborating with established social media websites to promote <jats:italic>CJEM</jats:italic> articles using podcasts and infographics increases their social media dissemination.

С. Лазарев,"I believe that perversion in modern practice of the evaluation of our scientific performance happen by fault of us, bibliometricians, too, as bibliometricians were negligent and laze about the interpretation of indicators, about conceptions (e.g., “altmetrics,” a term that is devoid of attempts to reflect the nature of the “discipline”; the use of the term “metric” instead of “indicator” as a sign of overvalued diagnostic ambitions) and about terminology (e.g., the use of the terms “value” and “quality”, “usefulness” and “influence” as full synonyms). A bureaucrat–noticing all this in his own way and going into no details – comes to believe in “simplicity”, “obviousness” and “unicity” of bibliometric “diagnostics”. The consequence is “bibliometric illusions”. E.g. 1) “everything can be measured with one number!” (The result is  Hirschmania at the level of planetary psychosis. The Hirsch index acquired the status of a sacred cow among bureaucrats and of a Procrustean bed among scientists – at the same time.); 2) “the conclusions are obvious” (E.g. if the journal is not sufficiently cited, “it is necessary to oblige its authors to give appropriate references in each article”. And if the average good article of the natural science profile has at least 10 references, then this “should be a mandatory minimum norm”. Some of the world’s journals arbitrarily intervene in the structure of citations in the articles they receive! But forcedly falsified references are neither a means of information coupling, nor a bibliometric indicator.); 3) “if the bibliometric indicators adequately reflect the quality of the scientific product, it is necessary to oblige scientists to produce not a scientific product, but the corresponding values of indicators” (Many world’s journals are now looking not for “quality articles”, but for “articles that will not lower our impact factor”. Some methodological features might be mistaken for a consequence of “specific Belarusian (Ukrainian, etc.) conditions”, which “is fraught with the fall of our impact factor.”) As a result, there occurs a profanation of bibliometrics itself. This means of evaluation (which has never claimed the exclusivity of its status!) unwittingly turns into a repressive tool with a maximum claim to the truth of the estimates. At the same time, there is no understanding that it is impossible in principle to predict the reach of a certain value of bibliometric indicators. The use of bibliometric indicators not for their intended purposes automatically makes the evaluation parabibliometric. The power of these trends resembles a curse!",4,,,https://www.scieditor.ru/jour/article/view/93 https://www.scieditor.ru/jour/article/download/93/74,http://dx.doi.org/10.24069/2542-0267-2019-1-2-12-20,0,,10.24069/2542-0267-2019-1-2-12-20,2980163471,,,0

As a result of this, a constant and homogeneous publication was identified in the three sections, but with differences in the dynamics of production and consumption of information being in the TMS section where there is a greater number of bibliographic references and a better Price index, it also stands out the use of magazines and literature in English. In the CUE section, concentration of the literature in Spanish was observed, and a balance between the dates of the references every five years. In the case of PAU, greater internationalization and a preference for the book and use of references of dates of 15 years or more were observed. In general, a positive impact was observed by citation and alternative metrics.&#x0D;; Keywords: Altmetrics; Journal analysis; bibliometry; Journal evaluation; impact factor; bibliometric indicators; architecture research; scientific production;&#x0D;;  &#x0D;; Recibido: noviembre 20 / 2019  Evaluado: diciembre 1 / 2019  Aceptado: diciembre 20 / 2019&#x0D;; Publicado en línea: enero de 2020                       Actualizado: enero de 2020</jats:p>",22,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.14718/revarq.2020.3029,0,,10.14718/revarq.2020.3029,,,,0

While 90% of all altmetric mentions come from Twitter, the known microscopic and macroscopic properties of Twitter altmetrics data are limited. In this study, we present a large-scale analysis of Twitter altmetrics data using social network analysis techniques on the ‘mention’ network of Twitter users. Exploiting the network-level properties of over 1.4 million tweets, corresponding to 77,757 scholarly articles, this study focuses on the following aspects of Twitter altmetrics data: (a) the influence of organizational accounts; (b) the formation of disciplinary communities; (c) the cross-disciplinary interaction among Twitter users; (d) the network motifs of influential Twitter users; and (e) testing the small-world property. The results show that Twitter-based social media communities have unique characteristics, which may affect social media usage counts either directly or indirectly. Therefore, instead of treating altmetrics data as a black box, the underlying social media networks, which may either inflate or deflate social media usage counts, need further scrutiny.",120,,,http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/623508/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-019-03112-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03112-0,0,,10.1007/s11192-019-03112-0,2940891025,,000-086-650-129-587; 000-114-141-599-148; 000-203-627-584-442; 000-267-262-611-008; 001-731-506-576-898; 011-440-664-122-077; 015-865-769-582-431; 016-800-097-183-663; 025-284-896-453-576; 030-245-319-431-165; 030-826-034-779-470; 036-935-882-457-459; 037-082-280-557-203; 038-766-155-184-499; 044-794-989-497-868; 044-894-018-787-174; 045-741-521-444-59X; 047-014-757-557-170; 047-436-441-352-101; 049-926-580-582-091; 051-965-959-247-371; 055-197-819-525-25X; 058-257-514-134-961; 066-600-406-284-968; 069-552-634-797-138; 079-960-774-328-742; 088-859-591-571-686; 089-618-673-558-521; 090-080-554-893-312; 093-230-568-806-179; 096-949-615-712-818; 099-816-321-816-355; 101-756-965-887-093; 103-268-627-372-687; 114-025-515-497-832; 116-545-996-099-174; 133-701-367-821-468; 141-257-490-542-634; 147-259-884-408-611; 148-075-002-626-968; 176-321-961-173-059; 176-613-431-700-098; 181-300-324-508-811,3

A los indicadores tradicionales como el Journal Citation Reports (JCR) de Web of Science (WOS) de la compania Thompson Reuters que mide el conocido factor de impacto (IF) y al indicador Scimago Journal Rank (SJR); que mide el impacto despues de normalizar el area y el prestigio de la revista de donde se recibe la citacion, que es usado por la base de datos SCOPUS de la casa editorial ELSEVIER, se han sumado otras mediciones que complementan el analisis cienciometrico de la produccion en cualquier area. Estos otros indicadores como el SNIP que mide impacto contextual de la publicacion y el IPP que mide el impacto por articulo publicado en una revista, se han complementado con poderosos indicadores extraidos de la web como el Eigenfactor (http://eigenfactor.org/) para evaluar la importancia de una publicacion en el ambito cientifico (Bergstrom, West, & Wiseman, 2008), el factor h o las metricas derivadas de Google Scholar. Esta tendencia tiende a aumentar y seguramente apareceran nuevos indicadores que estan encaminados en favorecer la riqueza y comprension de la publicacion cientifica (Acevedo-Triana, Lopez-Lopez, & Parra, 2014; McKerlich, Ives, & McGreal, 2013).; ; Estos indicadores, y sus derivados; como la posicion de los cuartiles y los deciles de las revistas e indices como el h y el g, no son solo herramientas de comprension de la comunicacion cientifica sino que han cobrado un papel determinante en la evaluacion de investigadores, revistas, programas de formacion, instituciones e incluso regiones y paises dichas evaluaciones ademas afectan los flujos de recursos para la investigacion y los sistemas de acreditacion de las instituciones (Batista, Campiteli, Kinouchi, & Martinez, 2006; Macilwain, 2010, 2013). ; ; La importancia de los mismos es evidente y tratar de desconocerla, mas que comprenderla para generar critica o nuevas formas de medicion, es poco productivo. Asi, es claro que el desarrollo de las tecnologias de informacion y comunicaciones (TICS) en especial en la web han generado nuevas formas de comunicacion y evaluacion. La web ha generado tambien sistemas alternativos de medicion de la circulacion del conocimiento, la Webmetria surge segun Torres, Cabezas y Jimenez (2013) alrededor de 1990 y su objetivo es conocer todo lo derivado de la web, desde sus impactos economicos y sociales hasta aspectos tecnicos de la misma, por tanto desborda los aspectos de las metodologias bibliometricas, aunque las usan en sus analisis. En cualquier caso, ponen en juego nuevos indicadores, por ejemplo, los derivados de los usos medidos en descargas, las visitas, las recomendaciones, entre otros, que muestran patrones complementarios a los de la bibliometria (Torres-Salinas, Cabezas-Clavijo, & Jimenez-Contreras, 2013).; ; Por otro lado, la velocidad con la que estos indicadores pueden producirse y ser objeto de analisis es determinante, pues entrega informacion de usos practicamente en tiempo real y permite discriminar los usuarios, lugares y tiempos de uso. ; ; Pero ademas, hoy en dia los articulos enterrados y sin ninguna cita, o la denominada literatura gris, e incluso las conversaciones informales en un pasillo pueden tener vida e incidencia en las dinamicas de la comunicacion de conocimiento. Los autores les pueden dar vida en discusiones en Facebook, Twitter, en Blogs, en la red e incluso en las redes academicas (Academia, Mendeley, Research Gate y demas, que pueden generar procesos insospechados.; ; Hoy se puede clasificar los usos en las bibliotecas digitales (numero de lectores, de grupos a los que se ha anadido y de lectores) menciones en redes sociales (Facebook, Google-plus, Twitter) menciones en Blogs, en enciclopedias (Wikipedia Scholarpedia), misiones en sistemas de produccion de noticas y cuando tengamos todos los programas de formacion en recursos abiertos esto permitira evidenciar mas claramente el uso de los recursos de investigacion en los procesos de formacion. Hoy los recursos de la red pueden generar que se discutan, compartan datos y se construya entre comunidades diversas en diferentes partes del mundo y mejor aun que puedan servir de recurso mas eficiente para la revision de pares y para el control contra el plagio.; Es evidente que los recursos de Altmetrics y su impacto en la ciencia estan aun en desarrollo. Asi, debemos pensar entre los indicadores bibliometricos y los de Altmetrics las posibilidades de interaccion y el complemento de informacion, asi como, las distintas dinamicas que surgen de la evaluacion de pares expertos. Sin embargo, y quizas es el aporte mas relevante, estamos a punto de poder traspasar los limites de indicadores privados y cerrados al mundo academico y poder medir la relacion entre apropiacion academica y apropiacion social del conocimiento, proponiendo nuevas formas de comunicacion entre las comunidades cientificas y la sociedad en general. Hoy Altmetrics esta en sus primeras etapas de desarrollo y seguramente transformaran la comunicacion y la produccion de conocimiento cientifico, debemos pensar en los nuevos recursos y prepararnos para estas asumir con eficiencia estas nuevas dinamicas para incorporarlas en nuestros sistemas de evaluacion estaticos.; ; Referencias; ; Acevedo-Triana, C., Lopez-Lopez, W., & Parra, F.

The amount of scientific production that is published in the domain hinders and disorientates the interested researchers. These researchers need guidance to exploit effectively the considerable amount of data and the diversity of methods, as well as to identify new research goals and develop their plans for future studies. This paper proposes a methodological pathway to investigate the core topics that structure the digital library evaluation domain and their impact. Further to the exploration of these topical entities, this study investigates also the researchers that contribute substantially to key topics, their communities and their relationships. The proposed methodology exploits topic modeling and network analysis in combination with citation and altmetrics analysis on a corpus consisting of the digital library evaluation papers presented in JCDL, ECDL/TDPL and ICADL conferences in the period 2001–2013.",20,,,https://lekythos.library.ucy.ac.cy/handle/10797/22697 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00799-017-0222-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00799-017-0222-x,0,,10.1007/s00799-017-0222-x,2714335461,,000-203-627-584-442; 000-792-009-951-071; 001-453-361-536-459; 002-103-299-202-373; 003-490-410-500-694; 005-657-459-454-849; 008-464-417-083-021; 008-914-647-597-234; 010-254-410-734-000; 010-543-448-844-716; 010-620-785-811-153; 012-367-777-689-406; 015-586-822-938-491; 018-282-773-310-003; 025-892-956-522-879; 029-692-461-278-092; 039-042-867-650-059; 039-726-749-165-80X; 045-044-449-040-609; 045-334-016-197-681; 046-863-428-922-835; 052-983-804-080-699; 055-788-708-180-492; 057-991-316-698-029; 063-613-593-733-100; 069-818-083-335-505; 081-294-381-516-128; 083-048-878-837-014; 085-311-661-786-39X; 085-506-131-972-726; 090-707-106-116-102; 103-948-823-290-389; 114-779-795-852-368; 115-126-213-266-202; 121-543-479-977-559; 123-212-217-825-703; 127-294-786-213-982; 130-082-649-613-668; 134-979-538-804-017; 139-838-736-626-664; 144-994-970-111-824; 167-262-201-037-579; 189-251-885-568-411,1

This descriptive-correlation study investigates the relationships between different variables based on its proposed conceptual model. Systematic and stratified sampling was employed and, using the Cochrane formula, the sample size was determined to be 1892 articles. Data were collected using the PLOS altmetrics, and path analysis was administered to test the conceptual model by using AMOS software. The results convey that Mendeley was the most effective path resulting to citation. Mendeley has a positive and significant relationship with citation via save as an intermediator. Twitter also had a negative and significant relationship with citation via discussion as an intermediating factor. Yet, neither save metrics on CiteULike and Figshare nor discussion on Facebook and Wikipedia does create a path of influence on citation. Identifying the effective paths through which social networks affect citation via altmetrics and presenting a final model of those paths could enrich and expand the theoretical foundations in the field of altmetrics.

Altmetric data resources include: policy documents, news outlets, blogs, online reference managers (eg Mendeley and CiteULike), post-publication peer-review forums (eg PubPeer and Publons), social media (eg Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, Google+, Pinterest, Reddit), Wikipedia, sites running Stack Exchange (Q&A), and reviews on F1000 and YouTube. Methods To identify the top 50 dental articles in 2014, PubMed was searched using the following query “(“2014/1/1”[PDAT]:”2014/12/31”[PDAT]) and jsubsetd[text]” in December, 2015. Consequently, all PubMed records were extracted and sent to Altmetric LLP (London, UK) as a CSV file for examination. Data were analysed by Microsoft Office Excel 2010 using descriptive statistics and charts. Results Using PubMed searches,15,132 dental articles were found in 2014. The mean Altmetric score of 50 top dental articles in 2014 was 69.5 ± 73.3 (95% CI: −74.14 to 213.14). The British Dental Journal (48%) and Journal of Dental Research (16%) had the maximum number of top articles. Twitter (67.13%), Mendeley (15.89%) and news outlets (10.92%) were the most popular altmetric data resources. Discussion Altmetrics are intended to supplement bibliometrics, not replace them. Altmetrics is a fresh and emerging arena for the dental research community. We believe that dental clinical practitioners, research scientists, research directors and journal editors must pay more attention to altmetrics as a new and rapid tool to measure the social impact of scholarly articles.",220,Bibliometrics; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Social Media,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27283563 https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2016.411,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.bdj.2016.411,0,27283563,10.1038/sj.bdj.2016.411,2409029719,,003-186-877-439-974; 004-837-149-986-673; 009-540-084-260-752; 010-493-707-773-877; 010-975-796-771-575; 012-752-680-853-012; 013-848-964-561-065; 017-085-829-673-85X; 020-574-736-729-573; 025-168-980-982-659; 025-807-155-588-406; 026-052-637-856-649; 032-094-932-105-517; 033-852-335-746-849; 042-775-335-276-357; 043-875-449-790-607; 043-926-859-214-140; 047-436-441-352-101; 050-252-270-491-60X; 050-562-977-385-96X; 066-329-787-124-275; 066-507-313-507-599; 070-646-445-398-886; 072-463-767-991-704; 075-173-203-874-231; 075-400-986-763-577; 075-662-520-089-891; 076-025-703-427-544; 097-484-468-502-763; 111-053-642-735-783; 112-819-717-307-656; 115-514-698-029-639; 124-320-473-105-363; 137-721-701-656-423; 138-561-175-358-392; 179-871-807-569-341,21

""Alternative"" metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly supported as a complementary measure of research uptake in the age of social media. Altmetrics are nontraditional indicators that capture a diverse set of traceable, online research-related artifacts including peer-reviewed publications and other research outputs (software, datasets, blogs, videos, posters, policy documents, presentations, social media posts, wiki entries, etc).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Compared with traditional citation-based metrics, altmetrics take a more holistic view of research impact, attempting to capture the activity and engagement of both scholarly and nonscholarly communities. Despite the limited theoretical underpinnings, possible commercial influence, potential for gaming and manipulation, and numerous data quality-related issues, altmetrics are promising as a supplement to more traditional citation-based metrics because they can ingest and process a larger set of data points related to the flow and reach of scholarly communication from an expanded pool of stakeholders. Unlike citation-based metrics, altmetrics are not inherently rooted in the research publication process, which includes peer review; it is unclear to what extent they should be used for research evaluation.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2018 The Authors.

Los resultados muestran discrepancias significativas entre los resultados de GSC y RG con las cuatro categorias de la clasificacion proporcionadas por Colciencias, lo que sugiere que Colciencias debe reconsiderar sus criterios de evaluacion incluyendo nuevas fuentes e indicadores. A su vez, considerando que las dos fuentes (GSC, RG) y los indicadores (indice H, RG-Index) se comportan de manera muy diferente respecto a las disciplinas, Colciencias debe tambien tener cuidado con las asignaciones disciplinarias, adoptando clasificaciones internacionales y desarrollando indicadores relativos por disciplina.

To this end, the study compares its findings with the data obtained from the collection of Colombian authors on a social network named ResearchGate - RG and the local information provided by Colciencias, which is the Colombian agency that publishes researcher classification from a platform named ScienTI. Findings revealed significant discrepancies between GSC and RG findings regarding the four classification categories Colciencias provided. This suggests that Colciencias must reconsider its assessment criteria including new sources and indicators. Considering that the two sources (GSC, RG) and the (h index, RG-Index) indicators behave differently regarding disciplines, Colciencias must also be careful with disciplinary assignments adopting International classifications and developing discipline related indicators. Colombian academic and research organizations should become more active in recognizing the potential and importance of Internet platforms to visibilize their research work and increase its impact (Ciencia 2.0).
