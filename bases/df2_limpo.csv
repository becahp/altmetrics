The way social users respond to scholarly outputs on the social web is called social citation, which can show the broadening of impact from academia to society. Climate change is one of the most life-threatening issues that everybody should be sensible and react to. Studying the scientific and social citations of articles dealing with climate changes, the present study attempts to provide new insights into the amount of social users' attention and reactions. It also investigates the correlation between scientific and social citations to shed light on the potential of altmetrics as an alternative or supplementary to its traditional predecessor. Besides, the study aims to carry out co-word analysis of scientific texts in the field and identify hot topics. Our findings showed that 3141 out of 6100 climate changes related articles retrieved from WoS were present in Altmetric explorer. They received 84380 and 17361 social and traditional citations, respectively. The articles were revealed to be mostly represented in Mendeley (133002 reads) and Tweeter (72108 tweets) followed by News outlet, Facebook, and blogs. The results of Spearman correlation test revealed a significant, though weak, correlation between WoS citations and social citations including Tweets, Mendeley readers, Facebook posts, blog posts, Google+ posts, news outlet and Article Attention Score. Multidisciplinary sciences were the most productive subject areas with the highest number of scientific and social citations. Co-word analysis of the articles showed that greenhouse gases emission; warming; species; adaptation; precipitation; energy; country, soil and crops are among the most frequent words. The value of the present study lies in the clarification of the extent to which social network users pay attention to climatic issues and how much is the power of altmetrics in showing the impact of science on society. Visualization of climate changes articles helps redirect cultural-political debates and associates discourses. It can help raise awareness in people and engage them in environmental conservation.","research , peer review , bibliometrics , citation indexes , social networks , scholars , international organizations , informetrics , quality control , information sources , climate change , visualization","forough rahimi, nosrat riahinia, hamzehali nourmohammadi, hajar sotudeh, mohammad tavakolizadeh-ravari",how academia and society pay attention to climate changes a bibliometric and altmetric analysis,webology

Aquest treball presenta les implicacions d'aquest canvi per a l'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa), que els últims anys ha passat a tenir en compte, en el seu sistema d'avaluació del rendiment, el nombre de citacions d'articles científics i el nombre de descàrregues de publicacions tècniques disponibles en el seu portal d'Internet. Com es pot veure en aquest article, els 42 centres de recerca de la institució presenten comportaments diferenciats pel que fa al rendiment en la producció exclusivament científica (nombre d'articles científics i de citacions) i en la producció tècnica (descàrregues de manuals, butlletins i altres publicacions).

This paper studies a variety of factors that affect the popularity of articles (i.e., the number of article mentions) in the field of psychology on Twitter. Firstly, in this study, we classify Twitter users mentioning research articles as academic versus non-academic users and experts versus non experts, using a machine learning approach. Then we build a negative binomial regression model with the number of Twitter mentions of an article as a dependant variable, and nine Twitter related factors (the number of followers, number of friends, number of status, number of lists, number of favourites, number of retweets, number of likes, ratio of academic users, and ratio of expert users) and seven article related factors (the number of authors, title length, abstract length, abstract readability, number of institutions, citation count, and availability of research funding) as independent variables. From our findings, if a research article is mentioned by Twitter users with a greater number of friends, status, favourites, and lists, by tweets with a large number of retweets and likes, and largely by Twitter users with academic and expertise knowledge on the field of psychology, the article gains more Twitter mentions. In addition, articles with a greater number of authors, title length, abstract length, and citation count, and articles with research funding get more attention from Twitter users.","social networks , bibliometrics , informetrics , research funding , discriminant analysis","nandhini devi soundara pandian, jin-cheon na, bhargavi veeramachaneni, rashmi vishwanath boothaladinni",altmetrics factor analysis for assessing the popularity of research articles on twitter,journal of information science theory and practice

Methods: Members of the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (AAHSL) were surveyed about their IRs. The authors used a mixed-methods approach of a survey and qualitative content analysis to identify common themes. Results: Survey results indicate that a large majority of responding medical schools and academic health centers have or are implementing an IR (35 out of 50, 70%). Of these, 60% (21 institutions) participate in an institution-wide IR rather than administer their own repositories. Much of the archived content is grey literature that has not already been published, but the percentage of original content varies greatly among institutions. The majority (57.1%) of respondent institutions are not considering an open access policy or mandate. Most institutions (71.4%) reported that repository staff are depositing materials on behalf of users. DSpace and bepress Digital Commons are the most popular repository platforms in this community. The planned enhancements that were most frequently reported were implementing a discovery layer and ORCID integration. The majority of respondents (54.3%) do not plan to migrate to a different platform in the foreseeable future. Analysis of respondent comments identified the following themes: integration, redundancy, and reporting; alternatives and exploration; uniqueness; participation; and funding and operations. Conclusions: The study results capture a view of the IR landscape in medical schools and academic health centers and help readers understand what services their peers have in place as well as their plans for future developments.","digital archives , library collections , medical libraries , health facilities , learning commons , health sciences , internet resources , scholarly communication , medical schools , medical school libraries , open access , institutional repositories , united states--us","daniel g kipnis msi, lisa a msls palmer, ramune k mals kubilius",the institutional repository landscape in medical schools and academic health centers a 2018 snapshot view and analysis,journal of the medical library association

The purpose of this paper is to capture characteristics of different book reviews on aspect preferences by opinion mining techniques. Design/methodology/approach The authors employ two indicators for identifying aspect preferences, and propose a method for quantifying overall differences of reviews on aspect preferences through three dimensions: aspect awareness, aspect satisfaction and comprehensive value. Findings The results show that book reviews on e-commerce websites contain information about external aspects of a book (e.g. hardcover), while those on social network websites pay more attention to content-related aspects of the book (e.g. stories). These results indicate that aspect preferences of reviews vary from platforms and make it hard to evaluate book comprehensively based on single-source data. Online book reviews from a wide range of sources can assess book impact from multiple perspectives and dimensions. Practical implications In order to illustrate the value of the authors’ method, the authors show book impact assessment based on multi-source data as an application of these difference analyses. Furthermore, the authors present an example of a book promotion to provide customized marketing services for different user clusters.

Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from Web of Science, Altmetric.com, and Twitter. A total of 91,826 tweets with 22,541 distinct Twitter user profiles for psychology discipline and 29,958 tweets with 10,478 distinct Twitter user profiles for political science discipline were used for analysis. The demographics analysis includes gender, geographic location, individual or organization user, academic or non-academic background, and psychology/political science domain knowledge background. A machine learning approach using support vector machine (SVM) was used for user classification based on the Twitter user profile information. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling was used to discover the topics that the users discussed from the tweets. Findings Results showed that the demographics of Twitter users who tweeted on psychology and political science are significantly different. Tweets on journal articles in psychology reflected more the impact of scientific research finding on the general public and attracted more attention from the general public than the ones in political science. Disciplinary difference in term of user demographics exists, and thus it is important to take the discipline into consideration for future altmetrics studies.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected by online survey and focus group from individuals who participated in the Developing Research Excellence and Methods (DREaM) project workshops in 2011/2012. The survey data were coded and analysed manually, as were the transcribed focus group discussions. Findings Following the conclusion of the DREaM project the participants at the core of the network applied their learning from the workshops to innovate in the workplace and to develop information services, with evident impact on end-users of library and information services. The strongest impact of the DREaM project, however, was found in reports of widened opportunities for the researcher and practitioner cadre members, many of which arose from collaborations. This provides evidence of a second proven strategy (in addition to the provision of research reports in practitioner publications) for narrowing the library and information science (LIS) research-practice gap: the creation of researcher-practitioner networks. Research limitations/implications Collaborative interactions between academic researchers and practitioners bring benefits to both network participants themselves and to the wider communities with which they interact. These are likely to be applicable across a range of subject domains and geographies. Practical implications Network grants are valuable for furnishing learning that may be applied in practice, and for bridging the research-practice gap. Social implications In LIS and other domains that suffer from a research-practice gap (e.g. teaching, social work, nursing, policing, management) the bringing together of researchers and practitioners in networks may address problems associated with misunderstandings between the two communities, and lead to improved services provision. Originality/value This study provides an evaluation of network development that goes beyond simply reporting changes in network topology. It does so by assessing the value that network relationships provide to individuals and groups, extending knowledge on mechanisms of collaborative interaction within research networks. It is also the first detailed study of the impact of a UK research council networking grant.","social networks , workshops , research methodology , communities , networks , learning , workshops , information services , domains , topology , united kingdom--uk","hazel hall, peter cruickshank, bruce ryan",closing the researcher practitioner gap,journal of documentation

We found few traditional metrics, like the Journal Impact Factor and number of citations, are familiar to and often used by scholars for research evaluation. Among altmetrics, only views/downloads, readers, and followers are known to more than half the respondents. Unseen benefits and lack of time are hindrances to using metrics for the evaluation of research outputs. Although social media are well‐known, scholars prefer promoting their research by publishing in journals and attending conferences. We found social media usage, perceived ease of use and usefulness of altmetrics affect the usage of altmetrics. Findings suggest altmetrics have attracted attention in academia and could be considered complementary to traditional metrics. We acknowledge that due to the limited sample size, statistics and demographics in this study, findings cannot be said to be representative of the entire academic population worldwide. Future studies are needed that cover a wider range of academic disciplines around the world.","social networks , scholars , journals , bibliometrics , demographics , social networks , informetrics , digital media , demography , familiarity , language usage , respondents","htet htet aung, zheng han, mojisola erdt, ashley sara aw, sei-ching joanna sin, yin-leng theng",investigating familiarity and usage of traditional metrics and altmetrics,journal of the association for information science and technology

Descriptive survey research design was used; four research questions were raised. The study population comprised of 264 LIS students at University of Port-Harcourt and Rivers State University, Nigeria, in which total enumeration sampling technique was used. 245questionnaire were returned and considered suitable for data analysis; this gave 93% response rate. SPSS output format based on simple frequency count and percentage distribution, mean and standard deviation were used for data analysis. The findings revealed that: LIS students ' awareness on emerging topics in the discipline was low; there were no practical sessions on Information Literacy, Digitization, as well as Indexing and Abstracting. Though there were modern facilities, yet, there were no RDA Toolkit and Teleconferencing facilities, just as students do not have the opportunity of evaluating their lecturers.

The purpose of this paper is to explore how researchers take on this responsibility. It uses the concepts of genre, authorship and self-writing in order to understand how the story of an academic life is constructed on academic web profiles. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative content analysis was conducted of material on 64 profiles belonging to 20 researchers on institutional and personal websites, as well as on ResearchGate, Academica.edu and Google Scholar. Findings The study shows that while institutional websites primarily contain researcher-produced material, content on commercial platforms is often co-constructed through distributed authorship by the researcher, the platform and other platform users. Nine different ways in which the profile of an “academic self” may be said to highlight the particular strengths of a researcher are identified. These include both metrics-based strengths and qualitative forms of information about the academic life, such as experience, the importance of their research and good teaching. Social implications This study of academic web profiles contributes to a better understanding of how researchers self-govern the story of their academic self, or resist such governance, in online environments. Originality/value The study furthers the knowledge of how researchers make use of and respond to digital tools for online visibility opportunities and how the story of the “academic self” is “made” for such public presentation.","research , qualitative analysis , writers , authoring , genre , web sites , writing , studies , scientific papers , websites , content analysis , social networks , visibility , authorship , researchers",helena francke,the academic web profile as a genre of self making,online information review

The statistical population consists of all the highly cited articles on surgery indexed on the Web of Science. The number of article citations was measured using the Web of Science and the altmetric score of the articles using the Altmetric Bookmarklet. The analysis of the data was carried out using descriptive statistics and Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Of the 1077 highly cited surgery articles, 62.74 per cent had an altmetric score. The highest number of received citations was 1787, and the highest altmetric score was 2019. A positive and significant correlation was observed between the number of citations and the policy-making documents, Wikipedia citations and CiteULike (P&lt;0.001). A positive but non-significant correlation was also observed between the number of citations and the number of Mendeley readers (r=0.02, P&gt;0.05). A poor, negative and significant correlations were observed between the number of citations and the overall altmetric score of the highly cited surgery articles (r=-0.235, P&lt;0.001). The findings may be due to the different pattern of using social media by the surgery researchers compared to the researchers of other fields.

The ability of these programs to generate and identify specific data patterns from a single posting has led to increasing interest in two aspects of machine learning in health care, namely Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR). AI ""mimics elements of human cognition by computational means"", whereas VR enhances this cognition by allowing users to interact with a ""three-dimensional, computer generated environment"", manipulating objects and scenarios in an artificial world. Introduced as a form of grey literature via Second Life, a popular role-playing online world launched in 2003, VR and AI have had a visible presence in numerous sectors, including healthcare. In 2011, IBM created Watson, a supercomputer considered to be one of the most revolutionary breakthrough's in artificial intelligence. To test this claim, Watson appeared on an episode of Jeopardy, one of the longest-running game shows in the United States, in a friendly competition match between two of the winningest contestants in the show's 50 year history. Watson's emphatic victory over the human contestants drew increasing interest to other applications of artificial intelligence and virtual reality, specifically in the field of healthcare. While the first use of AI and VR in medicine is believed to have occurred in the 1990s for interpreting electrocardiograms, the invention of cloud networking in 2006 is considered the first proven use of AI and VR in the modern era focusing on healthcare. Although the arguments for AI and VI in clinical settings are plentiful, ranging from enhancing imaging and increased processing speed in electronic medical record (EMR) applications4, the scenario is less clear-cut within the environment of cancer care. At the 2016 International Symposium of Biomedical Imaging in Prague, Czech Republic, a joint team of scientists and engineers claimed that the use of artificial intelligence resulted in a ""92% accuracy [rate of detection] in breast tissue cancer cells."" However, a column authored in 2017 disputed a claim by IBM thatWatson was the new revolution to cancer care. This paper will aim to shed light on how artificial intelligence and virtual reality is viewed in both health and cancer care fields via a two-fold environmental scan approach, namely an anonymous survey polling staff working at two cancer care facilities in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, asking respondents to comment on any papers they have ever encountered in their own practice/research discussing AI or VR. This practice will be supplemented with a comprehensive search through the academic literature to achieve a hoped-for grand total of fifty unique papers. Each of these papers will be analyzed via the use of Altmetrics, ""a single research output [that] can be talked about across dozens of different platforms"", a methodology introduced by Schopfel and Prost at GL 18, to determine how these perceived core papers are being shared via the use of social media.","cancer , social networks , grey literature , bibliometrics , artificial intelligence , virtual reality",marcus vaska,when the virtual becomes reality an environmental scan of the presence of virtual reality and artificial intelligence in health and cancer care environments,the grey journal

Health sciences library leaders were surveyed about the services that they currently provide or plan to provide in supporting biomedical research. Results: Library services were strongest at the beginning and end of the research lifecycle but were weaker in the conducting phase of research. Co-occurrence of codes from the qualitative data suggests that library services are on the fringe of rather than integrated into the research lifecycle.

A needs assessment survey was conducted to evaluate faculty members' research support needs and allow a more targeted approach to the development of research services in an academic health sciences library. Methods: The anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to full-time researchers at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto. The survey included twenty questions inquiring about researchers' needs and behaviors across three stages of the research cycle: funding and grant applications, publication and dissemination, and research impact assessment. Data were also collected on researchers' use of grey literature to identify whether current library efforts to support researchers should be improved in this area. Results: Among library services, researchers considered support for funding and grant applications most valuable and grey literature support least valuable. Researcher engagement with open access publishing models was low, and few participants had self-archived their publications in the university's institutional repository. Participants reported low interest in altmetrics, and few used online tools to promote or share their research results. Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased efforts should be made to promote and develop services for funding and grant applications. New services are needed to assist researchers in maximizing their research impact and to increase researcher awareness of the benefits of open access publishing models, selfarchiving, and altmetrics.","grey literature , bibliometrics , academic libraries , publications , funding , college campuses , open access publishing , social networks , researchers , librarians , dentistry , informetrics , scholarly communication , social research , roles , institutional repositories , united states--us","helen yueping he, madeline gerbig, sabrina kirby",needs assessment for improving library support for dentistry researchers,journal of the medical library association

Expanding the Manual de Valencia and accordance with other documents, also from the Red de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología ( Manual de Antigua and others), it is proposed and analyzed the linkage (visibility and impacts) of the University of Antioquia with its academic and non-academic environment. Specifically, an inquiry was conducted using the Google News as a source, to detect and characterize the publication of research news related to the institution, considering 1032 of its researchers from the faculties of Arts, Agricultural Sciences, Exact and Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities, Engineering and Medicine. In conclusion, it is evident that there are researchers who, due to their public interest and/or recognition issues with distinct scopes, have had greater visibility. However, the vast majority has not had it. This panorama leads to two actions in favor of the visibility and impacts that the University should make with its surroundings: a) generate institutional strategies to achieve a greater presence from the work of the communications offices or staff of this function in groups of research, faculties or the university in general, and b) better training for researchers and groups, to recognize that part of their scientific work also involves the dissemination or social appropriation of knowledge, and in this, the relationship with the media or the management of digital identity on internet platforms.","researchers , media , antioquia colombia","alejandro uribe tirado, jaider ochoa gutierrez, david medina alfonso",visibilidad de los investigadores de la universidad de antioquia en medios de comunicacion internacionales nacionales y regionales locales,revista interamericana de bibliotecologia

This examination of users’ language and perspectives may shed light on the role and value of user-generated reviews in complementing the traditional representation of resources and facilitating the discoverability of cultural objects. Design/methodology/approach This study involved a textual analysis of 474,803 unique reviews of Goodreads’ 2015 top-rated books generated by 9,335 Goodreads’ reviewers. In order to better understand the nuances of user-generated reviews, a content analysis was applied to 2,500 reviews of each of the five top-ranked titles in Goodreads’ Fiction Literature genre category. Findings The analysis of user-generated reviews demonstrates that language is a quite stable and reliable dimension across Goodreads’ users. The high rate of function words utilized, in particular I-words, coupled with positive emotion words, suggests that reviewers tended to convey their opinions in order to influence other individuals’ reading choices, or in Bourdieu’s (1985) terms, influence cultural production. In line with previous studies of user-generated reviews, the prevalence of positive reviews may also imply their unreliable nature. This study supports the importance of transparency regarding inclusion of user-generated reviews in traditional systems of knowledge representation, organization and discovery, such as WorldCat. Originality/value This study contributes to better understanding of linguistic characteristics of Goodreads’ reviews, including the role and value of user-generated reviews in complementing traditional representation of resources and facilitating discoverability of cultural objects.","writers , brand loyalty , books , psychological factors , empowerment , content analysis , social networks , user generated content , librarians , library cataloging , ratings & rankings , reference services , emotions , volunteers , knowledge representation , books",lala hajibayova,investigation of goodreads reviews kakutanied deceived or simply honest,journal of documentation

How are researchers’ online presentations created, managed, accessed and, more generally, viewed by academic researchers themselves? And how are expectations of the academic reward system navigated and re-shaped in response to the possibilities afforded by social media and other digital tools? Design/methodology/approach Focus groups have been used for empirical investigation to learn about the role online representation is assigned by the concerned researchers. Findings The study shows that traditional scholarly communication documents are what also scaffolds trust and builds reputation in the new setting. In this sense, the new social network sites reinforce rather than challenge the importance of formal publications. Originality/value An understanding of the different ways in which researchers fathom the complex connection between reputation and trust in relation to online visibility as a measure of, or at least an attempt at, publicity (either within academia or outside it) is essential.

Five key issues aligning in the RRI framework were discussed in the meeting, which are namely public engagement, open access, gender equality, science education, and ethics. As pointed out by the expert panelists, the aspects of ethics in research and academia include the research integrity, minimization of research misconduct and plagiarism, besides a few others. Recently launched “RRI-Practice Report from National Case Study: India”, extensively analyzed the public policy instruments facilitating the governance of responsible research in India. The fundamental tenets of responsibility in research and innovation are to be based on the ideas of Access, Equity, and Inclusion (AEI), as identified by the said country case study. On the other hand, the idea of Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) was advocated by the Prime Minister of India in lines with the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) during the 104th Indian Science Congress, 2017. RRI framework addresses many of the critical issues related to SSR. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in the RRI Framework while ensuring the research integrity in India. This paper includes the highlights from the INSA Policy Statement on ""Dissemination and Evaluation of Research Output in India"" (2018), UGC (Promotion of Academic Integrity and Prevention of Plagiarism in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations (2018), and RRI-Practice’s “Report from National Case Study: India” (2018).","public policy , consultation , plagiarism , integrity , ethics , science education , public participation , social responsibility , innovations , case studies , developing countries--ldcs , india",anup kumar das,research integrity in the context of responsible research and innovation rri framework,desidoc journal of library information technology

Our approach is to set up a traditional model in which the true quality or impact of a university department is determined by a panel of experts, but a citation metric is regarded as a reasonable proxy. However, the model assumes that the information contained in the scores provided by an expert panel exceeds that contained in a citation metric (HEFCE, 2015). Finally, we extend this model by including altmetric data to see if it adds information about a department's performance that cannot be gleaned from citations alone. We find the presence of altmetric data for the cited underpinning research to be highly correlated with peer review scores for societal impact. Conversely, no such connection was seen with the assessment of research quality. Our findings therefore suggest altmetric data could be useful as an aid to assessing impact.","quality assessment , bibliometrics , informetrics","jenny wooldridge, mike b king",altmetric scores an early indicator of research impact,journal of the association for information science and technology

Design/methodology/approach The HCAs published across the top four LIS journals were downloaded, coded and a database was developed with basic metadata elements for analysis using bibliometric indicators. Lotka’s Inverse Square Law of Scientific Productivity was applied to assess the author’s productivity of HCA. The content analysis method was also used to find out the emerging areas of research that have sought high citations. Findings Inferences were drawn for the proposed five number of research questions pertaining to individual productivity, collaboration patterns country and institutional productivity, impactful areas of research. The Netherland found to be the potential player among all the affiliating countries of authors and Loet Leydesdorff tops the list among the prolific authors. It is observed that Lotka’s Classical Law also fits the HCA data set in LIS. “Research impact measurement and research collaboration,” “Social networking” and “Research metrics and citation-based studies” are found to be the emerging areas of LIS research. Practical implications Researchers may find a way what gets cited in specific areas of LIS literature and why along with who are the prolific authors. Originality/value This study is important from the perspective of the growing research field of the LIS discipline to identify the papers that have influenced others papers as per citation count, spot the active and more impactful topics in LIS research.","research methodology , authoring , journals , scientometrics , science , journals , bibliometrics , citation indexes , studies , cooperation , knowledge management , content analysis , library and information science , scholars , productivity , authorship , librarians , researchers , impact factors , libraries , united states--us","jyotshna sahoo, basudev mohanty, oshin biswal, nrusingh kumar dash, jayanta kumar sahu",authorship trend and content analysis,performance measurement and metrics

It also identifies and summarizes open access fund criteria and viability. The goal is to better understand the sustainability of open access funds, as well as identify potential best practices for institutions with open access funds. Methods – Publication data was solicited from universities with open access (OA) funds, and supplemented with publication and author metrics, including Journal Impact Factor, Altmetric Attention Score, and author h-index. Additionally, data was collected from OA fund websites, including fund criteria and guidelines. Results – Library OA funds tend to support faculty in science and medical fields. Impact varied widely, especially between disciplines, but a limited measurement indicated an overall smaller relative impact of publications funded by library OA funds. Many open access funds operate using similar criteria related to author and publication eligibility, which seem to be largely successful at avoiding the funding of articles published in predatory journals. Conclusions – Libraries have successfully funded many publications using criteria that could constitute best practices in this area. However, institutions with OA funds may need to identify opportunities to increase support for high-impact publications, as well as consider the financial stability of these funds. Alternative models for OA support are discussed in the context of an ever-changing open access landscape.","bibliometrics , libraries , open access , academic publications","amanda b click, rachel borchardt",library supported open access funds criteria impact and viability,evidence based library and information practice

This study is therefore an attempt to fill this gap in the context of bibliometric analysis of single journals. The purpose of this bibliometric study was to examine the publication characteristics and developments of JHEM over an eight (8) year period from 2007 to 2016. The following bibliometric measures were analysed in this study: (a) productivity of articles, (b) productivity of authors, (c) degree of author collaboration, (d) listings of core authors, (e) Institution and country affiliations of authors, (e) types of sources cited by researchers, (f) timeliness of sources cited by researchers, (g) rank list of frequently cited journal titles and (h) rank list of frequently cited authors (i) to identify the types of sources cited by authors in JHEM. The results revealed a total of 83 articles and 1,821 citations within the period of study. Single authors had the highest number of papers with 54% of the total number of papers and degree of collaboration ranged between 0.14 - 0.67. The Journal of Higher Education was the most sighted journal with a total of 27 citations. In addition, the results revealed that JHEM had a low self-citation with a total of 7 citations out of the total number of citations. The findings suggests that JHEM needs to increase its indexed databases, in order to boost awareness of the journal, there is also need for multidisciplinary collaborations to encourage a wide variety of authorship. Also, the number of annual issues should be increased from the current single annual issue to enable the publication of more articles.","research , handbooks , higher education , citations , collaboration , bibliometrics , journals , science , studies , publications , knowledge management , library and information science , librarians , researchers , libraries , isamuddin, riduan (hambali)","seno essien antia-obong, biddy casselden, alison pickard",a bibliometric analysis of journal of higher education management jhem from 2007 to 2016,library philosophy and practice

When providers gave discrepant results for the same metric, the maximum value was used. Publons data are described, and correlations are calculated between Publons metrics and altmetric and bibliometric indicators.Main Results –In terms of coverage, Publons is biased in favour of life sciences and subject areas associated with health and medical sciences. Open access publishers are also over-represented. Articles reviewed in Publons overwhelmingly have one or two pre-publication reviews and only one post-publication review. Furthermore, the metrics of significance and quality (rated on a 1 to 10 scale) are almost identically distributed, suggesting that users may not distinguish between them. Pearson correlations between Publons metrics and bibliometric and altmetric indicators are very weak and not significant.Conclusion –The biases in Publons coverage with respect to discipline and publisher support earlier research and suggest that the willingness to publish one's reviews differs according to research area. Publons metrics are problematic as research quality indicators. Most publications have only a single post-publication review, and the absence of any significant disparity between the scoresof significance and quality suggest the constructs are being conflated when in fact they should be measuring different things. The correlation analysis indicates that peer evaluation in Publons is not a measure of a work's quality and impact.","bibliometrics , informetrics , quality",scott goldstein,publons peer evaluation metrics are not reliable measures of quality or impact,evidence based library and information practice

We can recognize a large amount of exhaustive information about who reads research articles and the contexts in which research articles are read by using data about people who register in Mendeley as readers of articles. The purpose of this paper is to explore different types of users of international Egyptian academic articles indexed in Scopus across four major fields: health sciences, life sciences, physical sciences and social sciences inside and outside academia. The aim is to determine the impact and use of international Egyptian academic articles in Mendeley compared to their citation impact and to explore whether there is any correlation between Mendeley readership counts and the citation indicators for these publications. Furthermore, this study analyses readers’ categories and discovers their country locations according to the data retrieved from Mendeley profiles. The data for this study are collected from the Scopus database. Webometric Analyst 2.0 is used to retrieve Mendeley readership statistics for all collected articles. This information will help in understanding how and to what extent Mendeley readership metrics are applicable in assessing the publications of Egyptian authors and in understanding the usage versus citation pattern and impact of Egyptian scientific outputs on global society. The results indicate that the majority of readers in all disciplines are Ph.D. students, master’s students, and post-graduate students; however, other types of academics are also represented. The findings also indicate that the highest correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts are found for the types of users who frequently author academic papers, except for professors in some sub-disciplines. Regarding country locations, Egyptian international publications are mostly used by users from more than 100 countries worldwide. However, the majority in every field are from the USA. Overall, this study concludes that Egyptian researchers have great international influence on global society. The study suggests that Mendeley readership may reflect usage similarly to conventional citation impacts if the data are limited to readers who are also authors, without the delay of influence measured by citation indicators. Meanwhile, Mendeley data can disclose the invisible impact of research publications, such as educational value for non-author users inside academia or the impact of research papers on practice for users outside academia. Finally, Mendeley readership statistics can reflect the distribution of users in various countries and potential readers worldwide, identify the invisible impact of the research output per country on global society, and be used as a complementary and informative tool for citation databases in explicating the influence of scientific outputs.","social sciences , research , databases , social organization , webometrics , bibliometrics , citation indexes , social networks , scientific papers , physical sciences , documents , citation analysis , indicators , researchers , statistical analysis , readers , students , resource sharing , egypt",metwaly ali mohamed eldakar,who reads international egyptian academic articles an altmetrics analysis of mendeley readership categories,scientometrics

After briefly presenting each model’s distinctive features, we assess their impact on the research field based on a wide range of bibliometric techniques (direct, indirect, and adjusted citation impacts, altmetrics, academic reviews, journals and publishers’ prestige). Our analysis shows that the narrower cultural distance construct has lost ground to the wider psychic distance one. Furthermore, researchers highly value those models and measurement that go beyond the cultural and psychic distance constructs providing a multidimensional framework to analyze and measure cross-national distance among countries.

The objective of the study is to investigate the citation, usage, reach and readership of scholarly books published by Springer Nature during a three-year time-span after their publication using citations, downloads, social media mentions and online reference manager bookmarks data. The study population was limited to those Springer books published in 2014, covering four broad disciplines (pure sciences, social sciences, engineering and medicine) to study disciplinary differences. The 3&#xa0;years’ span was chosen to make sure all books had enough time to attract citations, downloads, attentions and bookmarks. Data on 1116 randomly-selected books were obtained in July 2018 and they contained the total number of times each book was cited in CrossRef.com, downloaded in Link.Springer.com, mentioned in altmetric.com, and bookmarked in Mendeley.com over a three-year time window from January 1, 2015 to December 30, 2017. Although books are the preferred publication format especially in arts, humanities and social sciences, the results of book assessment based on the citation, usage, social media metrics from social science discipline was not apparent. This is evident as books in pure sciences were more frequently cited, books in medicine received more social media attentions and engineering books had the highest download counts and Mendeley bookmarks. The results also demonstrated that Crossref citations and SpringerLink downloads correlated significantly in all four disciplines indicating books with more download statistics also accumulated higher citation counts. The study is significant to provide evidence that alternative sources such as usage-based and social media-based metrics could act as complement to traditional citation-based measures for assessing the impact of books and/or book chapters in a multidimensional way.","social sciences , engineering , bibliometrics , social networks , books , social networks , medicine , bibliometrics , windows (intervals) , downloading , population studies , books , books , social sciences , digital media , medicine , books","mohammadamin erfanmanesh, a noorhidawati, a abrizah",what can bookmetrix tell us about the impact of springer natures books,scientometrics

Second, combining traditional citation indicators with altmetrics indicators, a process of influence evaluation and comparison model on Chinese and American OA journals is constructed. Third, an evaluation indicator system of OA journals from two dimensions of academic influence and societal influence is constructed too. Lastly, through normalization, correlation analysis, reliability analysis, validity analysis, factor analysis and two-dimensional analysis, the academic and societal influence of OA journals are evaluated and compared between China and USA. It is found that in terms of academic influence and societal influence, the evaluation scores of international OA journals are quite different between China and USA. The influence of the USA is far greater than that of China. The results show a strong positive correlation among the 7 traditional citation indicators based on JCR, and a high positive correlation among the 8 altmetrics indicators based on Altmetrics Explorer, and the indicators have a significant consistency both overall and internal. There is a highly positive correlation between academic influence and societal influence scores for the Chinese and American OA journals. Overall, the results confirm that the evaluation of societal influence of OA journals is used as supplement to the evaluation of academic influence. Altmetrics is also a powerful tool to measure the societal influence of OA journals, but it cannot replace the traditional citation indicators at present.","reliability analysis , reliability aspects , factor analysis , mathematical analysis , bibliometrics , dimensional analysis , correlation analysis , open access publishing , two dimensional analysis , indicators , indicators , citation analysis , factor analysis , informetrics , dimensional analysis , evaluation , correlation analysis , factor analysis , correlation analysis , united states--us , china","rongying zhao, xu wang",evaluation and comparison of influence in international open access journals between china and usa,scientometrics

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the research articles published in New Journal of Physics during 2010 and 2016. Articles with video abstract ( N  = 315) as the experimental group, were matched 1:2, with articles without video abstract ( N  = 630) as the control group, by the same publishing issue, same article type. Specifically, the articles lacking video abstract that appeared immediately before and after each experimental group article were included in the control group. A negative binomial regression model was employed to analyze the data. After controlling for the characteristics of articles (including the number of authors, international co-authorship, character counts of title, character counts of text-based abstract, keyword counts, reference counts, page counts and funding), our results showed that articles with video abstract (experimental group) compared to the articles without video abstract (control group) were expected to have a rate 1.206 times greater for citation counts. This study suggests that a video abstract can potentially serve as a useful genre of a research article for receiving more citation counts.","authoring , regression analysis , physics , regression models , international co authorship","qianjin zong, yafen xie, rongchan tuo, jingshi huang, yang yang",the impact of video abstract on citation counts evidence from a retrospective cohort study of new journal of physics,scientometrics

Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI), as an emerging interdiscipline, has a rapid development in these years. Traditional indices can’t reflect the influence of the AI research outputs quickly, thus more timely altmetrics indices are needed. In this paper, we conduct four studies about altmetrics indices and AI research outputs based on the datasets collected from Altmetric.com and Scopus database. First, we provide a review of the research status in the AI field. Second, we show the AI researches that attracted the most attention. Third, we demonstrate the general effectiveness of altmetrics indices in the AI field. Last, we examine the effectiveness of altmetrics indices for different levels of AI journal papers and AI conference papers. Our results indicate that there is a rapid increase of AI publications and the public has paid more attention to AI research outputs since 2011. It is found that altmetrics indices are effective to discriminate highly cited publications and publications whose citation counts increase quickly. Among all Altmetric sub-indicators, Number of Mendeley readers is the most effective. Moreover, the results indicate that altmetrics indices are more effective in high levels of AI journal papers and AI conference papers. The main contribution of this paper is investigating the effectiveness of altmetrics indices from the perspective of different levels of publications. This study lays the foundation for further investigations about effectiveness of altmetrics indices from new perspectives, and it has important implication for the studies about the impact of social media on the scientific community.","research , citation analysis , artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence , bibliometrics , artificial intelligence , informetrics , artificial intelligence , documents , digital media","xi zhang, xianhai wang, hongke zhao, patricia ordonez de pablos, yongqiang sun, hui xiong",an effectiveness analysis of altmetrics indices for different levels of artificial intelligence publications,scientometrics

Training sessions and workshops are often arranged to increase knowledge and awareness in the academic community, but engagement is often low. On the other hand, some academic staff, who already do engage, will happily attend sessions and workshops to increase their knowledge even further. The struggle to increase OA engagement overall could be due to the training not being appealing enough, and academics not being aware of benefits until after they have attended workshops. At the University of Essex, we took a bold, brave and curious approach to increasing engagement during Open Access Week 2018, and created an OA-themed escape room. This resulted in great engagement from students, academic staff and professional services staff, some of whom reported that they never knew how relevant OA was for them. The Open Access Escape Room was a success, and provided a positive environment for conversations around OA.","research , community relations , journals , verbal communication , open access publishing , copyright , workshops , researchers , scholarly publishing , libraries , scholarly communication , literacy , training , colleges & universities , united kingdom--uk",katrine sundsbo,open access escape room the key to oa engagement,insights

The dataset consists of more than 10,000 tweets, and these mentions, retweets and followers were used to generate a connected, undirected graph. This graph reveals the most influential tweeters by identifying the largest drop in the eigenvalue of adjacency or affinity matrix of a graph when certain nodes are removed; those which, when deleted, cause the greatest drop in the eigenvalue of the graph are considered to be the most influential. The machine-learning model applied in this work utilizes a feature vector containing the accumulated sum of the rank scores of those influential users who tweet a given article, along with known altmetric features such as the user type and post counts for various social media. Finally, the supervised-learning model was trained using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers with 11 features, including the sum of the ranks of influential users who tweet a given article in our dataset. The results were analysed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Precision Recall (PR) curves, which give the commendable outcomes&#xa0;compared to the&#xa0;baseline model. We found that, for the classification of highly cited articles, Twitter users’ score for influence is the most important feature. Finally, we show that our model—which was trained by&#xa0;taking the score for influence into consideration—outperforms the baseline, at 79% for ROC and 90% for PR with the Random Forest Model, effectively identifying the highly cited articles.","eigen values , social networks , eigenvalues , data management , data processing , bibliometrics , machine learning , informetrics , support vector machines , learning algorithms , digital media","saeed-ul hassan, timothy d bowman, mudassir shabbir, aqsa akhtar, mubashir imran, naif radi aljohani",influential tweeters in relation to highly cited articles in altmetric big data,scientometrics

A factor analysis of eight indices retrieved from the 362 data items was conducted. A total of 24 Chinese researchers were interviewed and given a robust test. Findings The results indicate that Chinese general social media (GSM) is insufficient to support academic research and it is difficult for scholars to enhance the visibility of their academic performance using GSM platforms, which can actually induce addiction. University resources, management systems, and working environment affect how scholars apply SM. Research limitations/implications The authors examined the researchers’ SM behavior by giving them a questionnaire and interview; however, this approach proved inadequate. The academic performance of researchers is affected by numerous factors, but the authors only considered SM behavior. Practical implications It is suggested that universities apply academic social media (ASM) indicators to measure researchers’ contributions so that they self-regulate their SM usage attitudes. Also, universities should also promote ASM platforms.

Design/methodology/approach An online survey was designed using SurveyMonkey software to collect data from 394 academic librarians in Nigerian Universities. Findings The study revealed that the academic librarians in Nigerian universities know and actually use self-archiving options such as ResearchGate, institutional repository and Academia.edu to self-archive their publications. While other promotional tools such as kudos, Mendeley.com and personal websites/servers are not popularly used by the academic librarians. Increased exposure of previously published work, broadens the dissemination of academic research generally, and increases institutions’ visibility were among the factors the academic librarians indicated as very important that motivate them to contribute their scholarly output to self-archiving options. Research limitations/implications One major challenge to the study is that many academic librarians in Nigeria do not check their e-mails regularly to enable them to respond to a request to participate in an online survey; some of them do not have stable internet facilities, whereas others are reluctant to respond to an online questionnaire. These reasons led to a low response rate which makes it difficult to generalize findings. Practical implications Findings from the study will create awareness for academic librarians in developing countries to see the need to self-archive their pre-print and accepted version of their papers in different self-archiving platforms.

This study aims to investigate different characteristics of worldwide research on the IoT using bibliometrics, network analysis and altmetrics. Growth of the literature, publication types, languages, publication countries and research subjects are addressed. The scientific and social impact of the journal articles has also been examined using citation and altmetrics scores. Design/methodology/approach The Scopus database was searched for articles indexed under the terms “Internet of Thing*” or “IoT” or “Internet of Everything*” or “Web of Thing*”, and a total of 13,725 articles from 2011 to 2016 were retrieved and analysed. Findings There was a continuous increase in the number of publications per year over the period, with a 6.7-fold rise in the number of publications, with the highest share of research output (4,989) published in 2016. Contribution of authors at the micro, meso and macro levels was analysed. About 89 per cent of total publications were the result of collaborative efforts, and Asia-Pacific was responsible for almost 53 per cent of world scientific production of IoT literature. Generally, the IoT research are found in publications concentrating on computer networks and communications, electrical and electronic engineering and computer science applications. The results also showed that the presence of IoT research on the social web is still low, with 6.8 per cent of total publications presenting some altmetric activity. Research limitations/implications The work reported is limited to only Scopus-indexed publications. While the search methodology aimed to be as inclusive as possible, it may not have captured all scholarly research output in the IoT world. Practical implications The findings of this study may help researchers understand the performance of IoT research from across the world and suggest directions for further research.

Design/methodology/approach The authors perform an exploratory analysis on the metrics the Altmetric Explorer for Institutions, platform offers for books. The authors use two distinct data sets of books. On the one hand, the authors analyze the Book Collection included in Altmetric.com. On the other hand, the authors use Clarivate’s Master Book List, to analyze Altmetric.com’s capabilities to download and merge data with external databases. Finally, the authors compare the findings with those obtained in a previous study performed in PlumX. Findings Altmetric.com combines and orderly tracks a set of data sources combined by DOI identifiers to retrieve metadata from books, being Google Books its main provider. It also retrieves information from commercial publishers and from some Open Access initiatives, including those led by university libraries, such as Harvard Library. We find issues with linkages between records and mentions or ISBN discrepancies. Furthermore, the authors find that automatic bots affect greatly Wikipedia mentions to books. The comparison with PlumX suggests that none of these tools provide a complete picture of the social attention generated by books and are rather complementary than comparable tools.

Design/methodology/approach The study employed 30 semi-structured interviews with researchers at a major Scottish university. The authors analysed the interview transcriptions using directed content analysis. Findings The researchers relied on the four sources of self-efficacy proposed by Bandura (1977) when using social media for knowledge sharing. These sources lead researchers to use social media effectively and frequently for sharing knowledge, although some may discourage its use.

This article examines the current state and potential future of academic library-based publishing. The review of the literature explores the scholarly communication ecosystem as it pertains to new publishing paradigms supported by academic libraries, including the complexity of nontraditional publishing models. These models and their implications, as well as how they may be implemented, are then explored in the academic library environment. Next, survey data from nineteen academic librarians collected at the American Library Association Midwinter Meeting in January 2015 is presented. Based on the literature and the survey data, this article argues that the principle concerns for academic library-based publishing going forward include 1) the need for the dedicated and/or sustained financial models for library-based publishing initiatives and 2) the cultural and financial capital to support librarians as they further expand their knowledge and expertise to support additional publishing-related functionalities in support of these new models. Both of these concerns ultimately tie to the persistent question of perceived quality, and by extension, reputation, of library-based publishing and open access publishing more broadly.","scholars , librarians , academic libraries , library associations , libraries , polls & surveys , academic discourse","heather moulaison sandy, janice bially mattern",academic library based publishing a state of the evolving art,library trends

It analyzes how this development, now that open access is becoming a scholarly norm and common goal for scholarly publishing, is taking two forms, both of which are about making the move, if not a flip, from the subscription model for the circulation of journals to that of open access. The paper sets out the terms and instances of the two paths to open access. The one is a commercialization of open access publishing dominated by the large corporate academic publishers that are pursuing open access on their own terms through the article processing charge (APC) and in relation to the acquisition and development of scholarly communication infrastructure. The other, older tradition, if still on a smaller scale, is one of cooperation and collaboration, growing out of the commons that the library has always represented, involving libraries, journals, and archives, as well as open source tool and platform development. There is some crossover between the two paths, between library consortia and corporate publishers, and this paper encourages librarians to consider how they might take advantage of the market for publishing services that the two paths are creating amid the move to universal open access as a scholarly norm.","research , journals , academic libraries , cooperation , public access , books , open access publishing , initiatives , archives & records , researchers , subscriptions , scholarly publishing , publishing industry , scholarly communication , libraries , collaboration , academic discourse , willinsky, john",john willinsky,the academic library in the face of cooperative and commercial paths to open access,library trends

An approach combining both statistical and simple content analysis was adopted to examine important factors contributing to citation counts and Twitter mentions, as well as the patterns of tweets mentioning academic articles. Findings Compared to citation counts, Twitter mentions have stronger affiliations with readability and accessibility of academic papers. Readability here was defined as the content size of articles and the usage of jargon and scientific expressions. In addition, Twitter activities, such as the use of hashtags and user mentions, could better facilitate the sharing of articles. Even though discussions of articles or related social phenomena were spotted in the contents of tweets, simple counts of Twitter mentions may not be reliable enough for research evaluations due to issues such as Twitter bots and a deficient understanding of Twitter users’ motivations for mentioning academic articles on Twitter.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how different institutional and individual factors affect the data sharing behavior of authors of research articles in sociology and political science. Design/methodology/approach Desktop research analyzed attributes of sociology and political science journals ( n =262) from their websites. A second data set of articles ( n =1,011; published 2012-2014) was derived from ten of the main journals (five from each discipline) and stated data sharing was examined. A survey of the authors used the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine motivations, behavioral control, and perceived norms for sharing data. Statistical tests (Spearman’s ρ , χ 2 ) examined correlations and associations. Findings Although many journals have a data policy for their authors (78 percent in sociology, 44 percent in political science), only around half of the empirical articles stated that the data were available, and for only 37 percent of the articles could the data be accessed. Journals with higher impact factors, those with a stated data policy, and younger journals were more likely to offer data availability. Of the authors surveyed, 446 responded (44 percent). Statistical analysis indicated that authors’ attitudes, reported past behavior, social norms, and perceived behavioral control affected their intentions to share data. Research limitations/implications Less than 50 percent of the authors contacted provided responses to the survey. Results indicate that data sharing would improve if journals had explicit data sharing policies but authors also need support from other institutions (their universities, funding councils, and professional associations) to improve data management skills and infrastructures. Originality/value This paper builds on previous similar research in sociology and political science and explains some of the barriers to data sharing in social sciences by combining journal policies, published articles, and authors’ responses to a survey.","journals , information sharing , statistical tests , websites , researchers , norms , empirical analysis , political science , statistical analysis , data retrieval , social sciences , sociology , policies , data management , professional associations , sociology , impact factors , statistical analysis","wolfgang zenk-moltgen, esra akdeniz, alexia katsanidou, verena nasshoven, ebru balaban",factors influencing the data sharing behavior of researchers in sociology and political science,journal of documentation

We identified the most salient and common research themes in LIS and how the themes have evolved, by delving into the author-supplied keywords to proxy research themes in the field domain. Results indicate that the field of LIS has evolved in terms of its subject focus from information systems design and management in the 1970s to scientific communication, information storage and retrieval, information access, information and knowledge management, and user education in 2015. The application of ICTs in LIS practice and education, too, has emerged as a prominent topic in the field.

In response, this article compares pairs of articles that are tweeted, saved to a Mendeley library, or cited by the same user, but possibly a different user for each source. The study analyzes 1,131,318 articles published in 2012, with minimum tweeted (10), saved to Mendeley (100), and cited (10) thresholds. The results show surprisingly minor overall overlaps between the three phenomena. The importance of journals for Twitter and the presence of many bots at different levels of activity suggest that this site has little value for impact altmetrics. The moderate differences between patterns of saving and citation suggest that Mendeley can be used for some types of impact assessments, but sensitivity is needed for underlying differences.","citation analysis , sensitivity analysis , social networks , citation analysis , bibliometrics , libraries","fereshteh didegah, mike thelwall",cosaved cotweeted and cocited networks,journal of the association for information science and technology

In all, 116 ECRs from China, France, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the US were questioned about appraisal and reputation in structured in-depth interviews. Desk research supplemented the interview data. It was found that ECRs are assessed very traditionally, largely on journal papers, and cannot (although some would like to) see this state of affairs changing. Mainly, they would prefer that less weight be given to the volume of papers published and more weight given to the quality of their research and its impact on the body of knowledge in their field. Unavoidably, then, ECRs' efforts to build, showcase, and monitor their reputation are still very much associated with research achievements. Nevertheless, online scholarly communities, and ResearchGate in particular, are gaining ground among ECRs, with increase in visibility and citations, and therefore a maximization of research impact, considered to be their main reputational benefits. Metrics are regarded as 'a rule of the game' that has to be accepted, although ECRs have minimal interest in altmetrics.","educational evaluation , careers , scholarly communication , scholarly publishing , reputation management","david nicholas, eti herman, jie xu, cherifa boukacem-zeghmouri, abrizah abdullah, anthony watkinson, marzena swigon, blanca rodriguez-bravo",early career researchers quest for reputation in the digital age,journal of scholarly publishing

The selected descriptors are based on aspects related to technology, procedures, content, marketing and the personnel responsible for managing repositories. Design/methodology/approach In order to establish the indicators, a thorough review of the literature was carried out to identify existing indicators that are used to assess repositories. These were divided into five categories (technology, procedures, content, marketing and personnel) with a total of 48 components. An online survey was conducted with the repositories managers of 66 Spanish research institutions in order to verify the degree of fulfilment of the selected indicators. Findings The survey received forty-six responses, which represented a response rate of 69 per cent. Of these, 44 came from universities and two from research centres. In total, 65 per cent of the repositories have the capacity to import data from and export data to other university systems, mainly Current Research Information System (32 per cent). Most repositories have mechanisms for the large-scale import and export of metadata and digital objects (83 per cent). The use of altmetrics in repositories is widespread (44 per cent). Authors and librarians deposit most frequently (37 and 32 per cent, respectively), in spite of the fact that 44 per cent do not have full-time staff working in the repository. In more than 80 per cent of the repositories, between 90 and 100 per cent of the deposits are full-text documents. With respect to the tools used to promote the repository within the institution, these are primarily face-to-face training sessions (82 per cent), followed by support materials such as manuals and help pages (65 per cent). The academic authorities encourage open access among researchers in 56 per cent of cases, a significant element in repository marketing. Originality/value This work proposes a model based on five dimensions and 48 indicators to assess institutional repositories. This approach has been applied to Spanish institutional repositories to provide up-to-date information about their management procedures and promotional methods and the services they offer authors and the university community. This overview of Spanish repositories has provided an insight into the way in which repositories have evolved in recent years and allowed potential improvements to be identified based on the most advanced repositories.

The purpose of this paper is to employ the DID3 projects as a case study to explore the following research question: what roles do librarians and archivists take on in data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and international DH projects? Design/methodology/approach Participation was secured from 53 persons representing eleven projects. The study was conducted in the naturalistic paradigm. It is a qualitative case study involving snowball sampling, semi-structured interviews, and grounded analysis. Findings Librarians or archivists were involved officially in 3 of the 11 projects (27.3 percent). Perhaps more importantly, information professionals played vital unofficial roles in these projects, namely as consultants and liaisons and also as technical support. Information and library science (ILS) expertise helped DID3 researchers with issues such as visualization, rights management, and user testing. DID3 participants also suggested ways in which librarians and archivists might further support DH projects, concentrating on three key areas: curation, outreach, and ILS education. Finally, six directions for future research are suggested.

We also show that the disadvantages of the region still exist after the transition, and EE has an especially low contribution to communication and media studies (CMS). With a brief bibliometric analysis in CMS, the paper demonstrates that a strong bias holds against EE authors and editorial board members in leading periodicals in CMS, and at least 95% of EE research remains unnoticed by international scholars. We further argue that this phenomenon is obviously harmful to the field of CMS. This paper not only points out the general difficulties Eastern European communication scholars might face when trying to make their research internationally visible, but it also snatches at the chance to introduce a novel, a respected but internationally yet unnoticed Easter European (Hungarian) communication theory, namely, the Participation Theory of Communication.","research , scholars , bibliometrics , bias , hungarian , novels , communication theory , eastern europe",marton demeter,the global souths participation in the international community of communication scholars from an eastern european point of view,publishing research quarterly

The factors include journal impact factor, individual collaboration, international collaboration, institution prestige, country prestige, research funding, abstract readability, abstract length, title length, number of cited references, field size, and field type and will be modeled in association with citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter posts, Facebook posts, blog posts, and news posts. The results demonstrate that eight factors are important for increased citation counts, seven different factors are important for increased Mendeley readers, eight factors are important for increased Twitter posts, three factors are important for increased Facebook posts, six factors are important for increased blog posts, and five factors are important for increased news posts. Journal impact factor and international collaboration are the two factors that significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all altmetric scores. Moreover, it seems that the factors driving Mendeley readership are similar to those driving citation counts. However, the altmetric events differ from each other in terms of a small number of factors; for instance, institution prestige and country prestige associate with increased Mendeley readers and blog and news posts, but it is an insignificant factor for Twitter and Facebook posts.

In this way, articles tend to be discussed and the impact of these articles tends to be increased. In order to measure this type of impact, a new score (named Altmetric) was created. Altmetric aims to understand the individual impact of each article through the attention attracted online. Objective The primary objective of this study was to analyze potential factors related with the publishing journal and the publishing trial that could be associated with Altmetric scores on a random sample of low back pain randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The secondary objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of these trials and their Altmetric scores. Methods We searched for all low back pain RCTs indexed on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro; www.pedro.org.au) published between 2010 and 2015. A total of 200 articles were randomly selected, and we extracted data related to the publishing trial, the publishing journal, methodological quality of the trials (measured by the 0-10 item PEDro scale), and total and individual scores of Altmetric mentioned and Altmetric reader. The study was a cross-sectional study, and multivariate regression models and descriptive statistics were used. Results A total of four variables were associated with Altmetric mentioned score: impact factor (β-coefficient=3.4 points), number of years since publication (β-coefficient=–4.9 points), number of citations divided by years since publication (β-coefficient=5.2 points), and descriptive title (β-coefficient=–29.4 points). Only one independent variable was associated with Altmetric reader score: number of citations divided by years since publication (β-coefficient=10.1 points, 95% CI 7.74-12.46). We also found that the majority of articles were published in English, with a descriptive title, and published in open access journals endorsing the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. Conclusions Researchers should preferably select high impact factor journals for submission and use declarative or interrogative titles, as these factors are likely to increase the visibility of their studies in social media.","databases , back pain , publishing , clinical standards , publishing , visibility , randomized controlled trials , clinical research , readership , articles , impact factors , citations , electronic publishing , informetrics , clinical trials , physiotherapy , low back pain , social media","amanda costa araujo, dafne port nascimento, gabrielle zoldan gonzalez, christopher g phd maher, leonardo oliveira pena phd costa",impact of low back pain clinical trials measured by the altmetric score cross sectional study,journal of medical internet research

Design/methodology/approach This paper uses ratings-balanced sets of reviews of restaurants and hotels (3 sets) to train algorithms with and without gender selection. Findings Accuracy is higher on female-authored reviews than on male-authored reviews for all data sets, so applications of sentiment analysis using mixed gender data sets will over represent the opinions of women. Training on same gender data improves performance less than having additional data from both genders. Practical implications End users of sentiment analysis should be aware that its small gender biases can affect the conclusions drawn from it and apply correction factors when necessary. Users of systems that incorporate sentiment analysis should be aware that performance will vary by author gender. Developers do not need to create gender-specific algorithms unless they have more training data than their system can cope with.

Research administrators, grant offices, researchers, students and university managers, among others, are increasingly turning to academic librarians for information to meet their myriad research-related information and metrics needs. Sub-Saharan African countries’ emphasis on strengthening science, technology and innovation has exerted further pressure on information professionals and other stakeholders to develop and appropriately apply bibliometrics and altmetrics to inform decision-making and policy-formulation processes. Research output and impact metrics are not only quickly evolving but their volume has been unprecedented. This paper’s focus is the application of bibliometrics and altmetrics by academic librarians to support researchers in their respective universities. The paper argues that there is need for up-skilling or re-skilling the 21st-century sub-Saharan African academic librarian to select and apply appropriate metrics, tools and strategies to support researchers as they execute their responsibilities.

Metodologia: Revisão bibliográfica fundamentada principalmente nos conceitos de paradigma científico propostos pelo filósofo da ciência Thomas Kuhn. Resultados: A análise de citações é considerada como procedimento predominante para a atual avaliação da produção científica e, portanto, interpretada como parte do paradigma vigente. São apresentadas as principais críticas a essa metodologia e discute-se se a emergência da altmetria como resposta a essas anomalias poderia representar o surgimento de um novo paradigma.

This descriptive-correlation study investigates the relationships between different variables based on its proposed conceptual model. Systematic and stratified sampling was employed and, using the Cochrane formula, the sample size was determined to be 1892 articles. Data were collected using the PLOS altmetrics, and path analysis was administered to test the conceptual model by using AMOS software. The results convey that Mendeley was the most effective path resulting to citation. Mendeley has a positive and significant relationship with citation via save as an intermediator. Twitter also had a negative and significant relationship with citation via discussion as an intermediating factor. Yet, neither save metrics on CiteULike and Figshare nor discussion on Facebook and Wikipedia does create a path of influence on citation. Identifying the effective paths through which social networks affect citation via altmetrics and presenting a final model of those paths could enrich and expand the theoretical foundations in the field of altmetrics. Besides identifying the most effective social networks and paths for online scientific interactions that lead to citation, the implications of this research can provide deeper insights for policy makers, editors and scholars.","social networks , bibliometrics , informetrics","saeideh ebrahimy, fatemeh setareh",direct and indirect influence of altmetrics on citation in social systems assessing a new conceptual model,international journal of information science and management

Maturity assessment analyzes how well a technological development can fulfill an expected task. The technology readiness level (TRL) has been considered to be one of the most promising approaches for addressing technological maturity. Nonetheless, its assessment requires opinions of the experts, which is costly and implies the risk of personal bias. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Bibliometric Method for Assessing Technological Maturity (BIMATEM). It is a repeatable framework that assesses maturity quantitatively. Our method is based on the assumption that each technology life cycle stage can be matched to technology records contained in scientific literature, patents, and news databases. The scientific papers and patent records of mature technologies display a logistic growth behavior, while news records follow a hype-type behavior. BIMATEM determines the maturity level by curve fitting technology records to these behaviors. To test our approach, BIMATEM was applied to additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Our results revealed that material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion and vat photopolymerization are the most mature AM technologies with TRL between 6 and 7, followed by directed energy deposition with TRL between 4 and 5, and binder jetting and sheet lamination , the least mature, with TRL between 1 and 2. BIMATEM can be used by competitive technology&#xa0;intelligence professionals, policymakers, and further decision makers whose main interests include assessing the risk of implementing new technologies. Future research can focus on testing the method with regard to altmetrics.","additive manufacturing , maturity , intelligence , bibliometrics , business competition , powder beds , life cycles , powder , curve fitting , test procedures , manufacturing , technology , life cycle engineering , scientific papers , maturity , photopolymerization , news , risk assessment , lamination , patents , risk assessment , extrusion , new technology","rene lezama-nicolas, marisela rodriguez-salvador, rosa rio-belver, inaki bildosola",a bibliometric method for assessing technological maturity the case of additive manufacturing,scientometrics

This altmetric specially developed by the best-known academic social network ResearchGate is intended to indicate a researcher’s academic perception in one single figure. We conducted a self-experiment to demonstrate that the indications of the RG score are difficult for the user to understand and are not transparent. They therefore do not fulfil the requirements of the Leiden Manifesto for research metrics. The results of our investigation show that activity in social networks appears to have a great impact on the RG score and can strategically and selectively influence this result. Furthermore, we succeeded in entering publications by other authors as our own, thus dramatically improving our RG score. On the whole, with a little effort and without any academic publications of our own we were able to achieve an RG score which was higher than almost half the scores of all ResearchGate users. This self-experiment should be interpreted as a pilot study and can be implemented in an expanded form in future.","social networks , social networks , scientific papers , documents , academic publications , bibliometrics","andreas meier, dirk tunger",investigating the transparency and influenceability of altmetrics using the example of the rg score and the researchgate platform,information services use

The h men index was found to have very strong positive and highly significant correlations of around 0.95 with each of the h indices.

The first category, although highly deplorable has almost no effect on the advancement of science, the third category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the second category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view, as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication, years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and social media attention by the three major categories. The data set comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from Elsevier’s ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were retrieved four times within 4&#xa0;years, which allowed us to examine post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for Mendeley reader counts. The major findings are that both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction.","citation analysis , authoring , digital media , citation analysis , plagiarism , professional misconduct","judit bar-ilan, gali halevi",temporal characteristics of retracted articles,scientometrics

The composition of the related entries, references of each entry, cooperation among contributors of entries, and common interests of contributors are analysed with Altmetrics, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and heterogeneous coupling. Altmetrics is used to analyse scholarly communication during the construction of entries. Citation analysis based on references in entries provides a way to establish indirect communication between citing and cited authors, namely the contributors of entries and authors of references. Co-occurrence analysis is used for the analysis of cooperation both among experts and lay Internet users and the distribution of tags of entries. Heterogeneous coupling is used to reveal the relationship among entries based on common references as well as common experts. The results show that literature is referred to during people’s online communication. The citations and tags of entries reflect the interdisciplinary specializations within Biomedical Science. The majority of experts cooperated with someone in the same affiliation but cross-unit cooperation also existed. The common interests of experts indicate that the specialists only master their own field.

Design/methodology/approach A structured questionnaire was designed and personally distributed among 200 research scholars in Central Universities in Delhi in May 2016. Of this, 180 filled-in questionnaires were personally collected by the investigator, eliciting a response rate of 90 per cent. Findings Findings of the study reveals that research scholars have knowledge of ASNSs. ResearchGate and Academia are the most used ASNSs among research scholars. ResearchGate is used the most for connecting to other research scholars, and Academia is used for sharing and following research. Additionally, ASNSs help research scholars in research and learning and to share research ideas and experience. Finally, research scholars find ASNSs time-consuming and have cited data security as main concern for using academic social networks. Research limitations/implications The findings of the study show that potential uses of ASNSs in Indian libraries are slow compared to the libraries of developed countries and some of the developing countries. It is suggested that universities under study may realize the benefits of ASNSs and incorporate these tools in their websites to enhance faster transfer and retrieval of information. Practical implications The results also stress upon the responsibility of research supervisors to accord knowledge of ASNSs among research scholars and encourage them to join and use ASNSs efficiently and effectively for building professional connections and collaborations in their research area. Social implications The study is significant because it represents one of the earliest works to shed the light on the current level of use of SNSs and ASNSs by research scholars in Central Universities in Delhi, which are in primitive nature. They provide space for self-expression, research updates, expert advice, connecting with fellow scholars, creating and joining events and discussions, presenting their views on a particular topic, finding collaboration on projects, finding jobs and much more. Originality/value ASNSs have further promoted the open source movement. The paper apprises the academic stakeholders about the unique features, adoption, acceptability and usage of ASNSs for research work, exchange of information and collaborations, so that more productive and quality research is produced. The findings will also guide research scholars to find popular ASNSs, so that they can build more academic connections.","collaboration , bibliometrics , information literacy , social networks , user generated content , scholars , researchers , bullying , scholarly communication , social research , web sites , open source software , developing countries--ldcs , information retrieval , delhi india","nowsheeba ashraf asmi, madhusudhan margam",academic social networking sites for researchers in central universities of delhi,global knowledge memory and communication

Morgan and Claypool, London, 2017b) proposed a new family of field- and time-normalized indicators, which is intended for sparse data. These indicators are based on units of analysis (e.g., institutions) rather than on the paper level. They compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g., on Twitter) of a unit with the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields and publication years. We propose a new indicator (Mantel–Haenszel quotient, MHq) for the indicator family. The MHq is rooted in the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) analysis. This analysis is an established method, which can be used to pool the data from several 2 × 2 cross tables based on different subgroups. We investigate using citations and assessments by peers whether the indicator family can distinguish between quality levels defined by the assessments of peers. Thus, we test the convergent validity. We find that the MHq is able to distinguish between quality levels in most cases while other indicators of the family are not. Since our study approves the MHq as a convergent valid indicator, we apply the MHq to four different Twitter groups as defined by the company Altmetric. Our results show that there is a weak relationship between the Twitter counts of all four Twitter groups and scientific quality, much weaker than between citations and scientific quality. Therefore, our results discourage the use of Twitter counts in research evaluation.","indicators , social networks , indicators , citation analysis , assessments , convergence , empirical analysis , subgroups , evaluation , citation analysis","robin haunschild, lutz bornmann",field and time normalization of data with many zeros an empirical analysis using citation and twitter data,scientometrics

This research investigated Finnish researchers’ opinions about the reasons for why their research had received significant online attention and if the attention received could reflect scientific or societal impact of their research. Furthermore it was studied whether the authors of the papers with significant online attention actively followed how their papers were shared or discussed online and if the authors thought that the online attention increased either the scientific or societal impact of their work. Based on the findings it can be stated that the level of online attention received is a sum of many factors and that there are also specific differences between the platforms where the attention has been received. For the articles that had received significant attention on Mendeley the reasons for that attention were more often seen as due to an academic audience, while the situation was reverse on Twitter, with the majority of reasons for the attention being linked to a wider audience. Similar trend could be seen when asked about whether the online attention could reflect scientific or societal impact, although a clear consensus about whether online attention could reflect any type of impact at all could not be reached.","research , social networks , informetrics , internet , digital media , trends","kim holmberg, julia vainio",why do some research articles receive more online attention and higher altmetrics reasons for online success according to the authors,scientometrics

Reflecting this tendency in the scientific community, alternative metrics for measuring scholarly impact on the web are increasingly proposed, extending (or even replacing) traditional metrics (e.g., citations, journal impact factor, etc.). This paper explores the relationship between traditional metrics and alternative metrics for psychological research in the years from 2010 to 2012. Traditional publication metrics (e.g., number of citations, impact factor) and alternative metrics (collected from Altmetric , a website that collects and counts references as they appear in Wikipedia, public policy documents, research blogs, mainstream media, or social networks) were extracted and compared, using a dataset of over 245,000 publications from the Web of Science. Results show positive, small to medium, correlations on the level of individual publications, and frequently medium to high correlations on the level of research fields of Psychology. The more accumulated the level of analysis, the higher the correlations. These findings are fairly robust over time and comparable to findings from research areas other than Psychology. Additionally, a new metric, the Score Factor , is proposed as a useful alternative metric to assess a journal’s impact in the online media.","psychology , public policy , psychology , social organization , bibliometrics , public policy , media , documents , media , public policy , social networks , impact factors , academic publications , bibliometrics , internet , digital media , correlation analysis","sebastian vogl, thomas scherndl, anton kuhberger",psychology a bibliometric analysis of psychological literature in the online media,scientometrics

In response, this first diachronic analysis compares reader counts within a month of publication with citation counts after 20&#xa0;months for ten fields. There are moderate or strong correlations in eight out of ten fields, with the two exceptions being the smallest categories ( n  = 18, 36) with wide confidence intervals.

The libraries also reported interesting projects, lessons learned, and future plans. The seven libraries profiled in this paper report a variety of service models in providing evaluation support services to meet the needs of campus stakeholders. The service models range from research center cores, partnerships with research groups, and library programs with staff dedicated to evaluation support services. A variety of products and services were described such as an automated tool to develop rank-based metrics, consultation on appropriate metrics to use for evaluation, customized publication and citation reports, resource guides, classes and training, and others. Implementing these services has allowed the libraries to expand their roles on campus and to contribute more directly to the research missions of their institutions. Libraries can leverage a variety of evaluation support services as an opportunity to successfully meet an array of challenges confronting the biomedical research community, including robust efforts to report and demonstrate tangible and meaningful outcomes of biomedical research and clinical care.

Here, we used multivariate models to evaluate the relative influence of collaboration, time since publication and traditional indicators on the interest of 2863 papers published in five ecological journals from 2013 to 2015 as given by nine OnSMP. We found that most activities were concentrated on Twitter and Mendeley and that activities in these two OnSMP are highly correlated. Our results indicate that traditional indicators explained most of the variation in OnSMP activity. Considering that OnSMP activities are high as soon as the articles are made available online, contrasting with the slow pace in which the citations are accumulated, our results support the use of activities on OnSMP as an early signal of research impact of ecological articles.","indicators , social networks , indicators , citation analysis , journals , scientometrics , social networks , ecological monitoring , internet , digital media , citations","joao carlos nabout, fabricio barreto teresa, karine borges machado, vitor hugo mendonca do prado, luis mauricio bini, jose alexandre felizola diniz-filho",do traditional scientometric indicators predict social media activity on scientific knowledge an analysis of the ecological literature,scientometrics

To investigate whether this age bias is constant or varies by narrow field and publication year, this article compares the proportions of student, researcher and faculty readers for articles published 1996–2016 in 36 large monodisciplinary journals. In these journals, undergraduates recorded the newest research and faculty the oldest, with large differences between journals. The existence of substantial differences in the composition of readers between related fields points to the need for caution when using Mendeley readers as substitutes for citations for broad fields. The second investigation shows, with the same data, that there are substantial differences between narrow fields in the time taken for Scopus citations to be as numerous as Mendeley readers. Thus, even narrow field differences can impact on the relative value of Mendeley compared to citation counts.","citation analysis , journals , readers , citation analysis , citations , journals , scholarly publishing",mike thelwall,differences between journals and years in the proportions of students researchers and faculty registering mendeley articles,scientometrics

This collaboration involved bringing together cross-institutional library teams to produce proof of concept data-visualised dashboards using library analytics data that could be made available to others via the Heidi Plus service. Design/methodology/approach The teams used an agile approach, which adapted the agile methodology for non-technical and disparate team members. The key agile elements were followed, including the Scrum approach, whereby teams had a product owner, several development team members, a data wrangler and a scrum master. Many of the dashboards took inspiration from some of the earlier Jisc work on library analytics. Findings A wide variety of proof of concept dashboards were created addressing a range of library issues. These fell into two main categories for the cross-institutional teams, namely, comparing the Society of College, National and University Libraries (SCONUL) annual statistics results against the National Student Survey (NSS) data and collection management and analysis. Research limitations/implications Some of the HESA data were potentially sensitive. In effect, this created a walled garden as some of the data were not designed for sharing. Furthermore, the data that the Jisc team used were restricted by publisher agreements, meaning that specific institutions' usage could not be identified to others. Originality/value The paper provides insight into the Library Data Labs project and discusses a number of implications from the outcomes of the project. These are now being investigated by HESA, Jisc and individual institutions.","library management , user training , data analysis , library resources , ethnography , internet resources , information literacy , academic libraries , collection management , higher education , united kingdom--uk","siobhan burke, ross macintyre, graham stone",library data labs using an agile approach to develop library analytics in uk higher education,information and learning science

The main motivation behind our research is to gain a better understanding of whether and how well the existing research metrics relate to research quality. For this experiment we have created a new dataset which we call True Impact Dataset and which contains two types of publications, seminal papers and literature reviews. Using the dataset, we conduct a set of experiments to study how citation and reader counts perform in distinguishing these publication types, following the intuition that causing a change in a field signifies research quality. Our research shows that citation counts work better than a random baseline (by a margin of 10%) in distinguishing important seminal research papers from literature reviews while Mendeley reader counts do not work better than the baseline.","motivation , literature reviews , literature reviews , reviews , scientific papers , documents , literature reviews , citation analysis , academic publications , datasets","drahomira herrmannova, robert m patton, petr knoth, christopher g stahl",do citations and readership identify seminal publications,scientometrics

These alternative metrics (altmetrics) still need to be evaluated in order to fully understand their meaning, their benefits and limitations. While several preceding studies concentrate on correlations of altmetrics with classical measures like citations, this study aims at investigating metric-compatibility within altmetrics. For this purpose, 5000 journal articles from six disciplines have been analyzed regarding their metrics with the help of the aggregators PlumX and Altmetric.com. For this set, the highest numbers of events have been recognized regarding Mendeley readers, followed by Twitter and Facebook mentions. Thereby variations considering the aggregators could be observed. Intra-correlations between the metrics across one aggregator have been calculated, as well as inter-correlations for the corresponding metrics across the aggregators. For both aggregators, low to medium intra-correlations could be calculated which shows the diversity of the different metrics. Regarding inter-correlations, PlumX and Altmetric.com are highly consistent concerning Mendeley readers ( r = 0.97 ) and Wikipedia mentions ( r = 0.82 ), whereas the consistency concerning Twitter ( r = 0.49 ), blogs ( r = 0.46 ) and Reddit ( r = 0.41 ) is on a moderate level.

The results suggest that it is feasible to use GSC and the MADAP method to produce an accurate depiction of the community of researchers working in Bibliometrics (both specialists and occasional researchers) and their publication habits (main publication venues such as journals and book publishers). Additionally, the wide document coverage of Google Scholar (specially books and book chapters) enables more comprehensive analyses of the documents published in a specific discipline than were previously possible with other citation indexes, finally shedding light on what until now had been a blind spot in most citation analyses.","journals , case studies , webometrics , scientometrics , bibliometrics , habits , scientific papers , citation analysis , communities , bibliometrics , books , books , books , citation analysis","alberto martin-martin, enrique orduna-malea, emilio delgado lopez-cozar",a novel method for depicting academic disciplines through google scholar citations the case of bibliometrics,scientometrics

This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the scientific literature for mapping the intellectual structure of CSCW research and its scientific development over a 15-year period (2001–2015). A total of 1713 publications were subjected to examination in order to draw statistics and depict dynamic changes to shed new light upon the growth, spread, and collaboration of CSCW devoted outlets. Overall, our study characterizes top (cited and downloaded) papers, citation patterns, prominent authors and institutions, demographics, collaboration patterns, most frequent topic clusters and keywords, and social mentions by country, discipline, and professional status. The results highlight some areas of improvement for the field and a lot of well-established topics which are changing gradually with impact on citations and downloads. Statistical models reveal that the field is predominantly influenced by fundamental and highly recognized scientists and papers. A small number of papers without citations, the growth of the number of papers by year, and an average number of more than 39 citations per paper in all venues ensure the field a healthy and evolving nature. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the influence of CSCW on the larger field of HCI.","citation analysis , demography , collaboration , scientometrics , statistical models , statistical analysis , demographics , cooperation , statistical models , mathematical models , scientific papers , documents , academic publications","antonio correia, hugo paredes, benjamim fonseca",scientometric analysis of scientific publications in cscw,scientometrics

We examined this issue empirically, by testing unidimensionality and the component structure congruence of the five ‘key’ AAS components: News, Blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. As a reference point, these tests were also done on different citation data: WoS, Scopus, and Google Scholar. All tests were done for groups of articles with: (1) high citations, but lower AAS (HCGs), and (2) high AAS, but lower citations (HAGs). Changes in component structures over time (from 2016 to 2017) were also considered. Citation data consistently formed congruent unidimensional structures for all groups and over time. Altmetric data formed congruent unidimensional structures only for the HCGs, with much inconsistency for the HAGs (including change over time). The relationship between Twitter and News counts was shown to be curvilinear. It was not possible to obtain a satisfactory congruent and reliable linear unidimensional altmetric structure between the groups for any variable combination, even after Mendeley and CiteULike altmetric counts were included. Correlations of altmetric aggregates and citations were fairly inconsistent between the groups. We advise against the usage of composite altmetric measures (including the AAS) for any group comparison purposes, until the measurement invariance issues are dealt with. The underlying pattern of associations between individual altmetrics is likely too complex and inconsistent across conditions to justify them being simply aggregated into a single score.","social networks , news , social networks , informetrics , scientific papers , citation analysis , citations","bhaskar mukherjee, sinisa subotic, ajay kumar chaubey",and now for something completely different the congruence of the altmetric attention scores structure between different article groups,scientometrics

OAMJs typically operate a ""soundness-only"" review policy aiming to evaluate only the rigour of an article, not the novelty or significance of the research or its relevance to a particular community, with these elements being left for ""the community to decide"" post-publication. Design/methodology/approach The paper reports the results of interviews with 31 senior publishers and editors representing 16 different organisations, including 10 that publish an OAMJ. Thematic analysis was carried out on the data and an analytical model developed to explicate their significance. Findings Findings suggest that in reality criteria beyond technical or scientific soundness can and do influence editorial decisions. Deviations from the original OAMJ model are both publisher supported (in the form of requirements for an article to be ""worthy"" of publication) and practice driven (in the form of some reviewers and editors applying traditional peer review criteria to OAMJ submissions). Also publishers believe post-publication evaluation of novelty, significance and relevance remains problematic.

Findings The study found much greater scepticism toward adopting SNS than previously reported. Reasons behind researchers' scepticism range from SNS being unimportant for their work to not belonging to their culture or habits. Some even felt that a profile presented people negatively and might harm their career. These concerns were mostly expressed by junior and midlevel researchers, showing that the largest opponents to SNS may unexpectedly be younger researchers.

The sample included 390 papers collected from the bibliographic database Scopus. Their altmetric and citation activities were measured at three time points: in July 2014, 2015, and 2016. The findings generally correspond to those observed in the large-scale studies of medical papers. Papers in renowned journals, and papers reporting clinical guidelines and multicentric studies had the most intense altmetric activity. In contrast, papers published in local, Croatian journals showed minimal altmetric activity, especially the papers published in Croatian. These results indicate that the local publishing community has not yet recognised social media as a tool for promoting research and that non-English language publications have minimal chances to receive attention, even in social media. The evaluative potential of altmetric indicators has to be further explored in a broader context.","social networks , journals , bibliographic data bases , academic publications , bibliometrics , case studies , croatia","dina vrkic, lea skoric, jelka petrak",altmetrics of papers from scientific periphery reflect global trends a case study of publications by zagreb university school of medicine,journal of academic librarianship

Design/methodology/approach Four types of journal Twitter accounts (journal, owner, publisher and no Twitter account) were defined to observe differences in the number of tweets and citations. In total, 4,176 articles from 350 journals were extracted from Plum Analytics. This altmetric provider tracks the number of tweets and citations for each paper. Student’s t -test for two-paired samples was used to detect significant differences between each group of journals. Regression analysis was performed to detect which variables may influence the getting of tweets and citations. Findings The results show that journals with their own Twitter account obtain more tweets (46 percent) and citations (34 percent) than journals without a Twitter account. Followers is the variable that attracts more tweets ( ß =0.47) and citations ( ß =0.28) but the effect is small and the fit is not good for tweets ( R 2 =0.46) and insignificant for citations ( R 2 =0.18).

The fact that GS provides the number of citations received by each article from all other indexed articles (regardless of their source) has led to its use in bibliometric analysis and academic assessment tasks, especially in social sciences and humanities. However, the existence of errors, sometimes of great magnitude, has provoked criticism from the academic community. The aim of this article is to carry out an exhaustive bibliographical review of all studies that provide either specific or incidental empirical evidence of the errors found in Google Scholar. The results indicate that the bibliographic corpus dedicated to errors in Google Scholar is still very limited (n= 49), excessively fragmented, and diffuse; the findings have not been based on any systematic methodology or on units that are comparable to each other, so they cannot be quantified, or their impact analysed, with any precision. Certain limitations of the search engine itself (time required for data cleaning, limit on citations per search result and hits per query) may be the cause of this absence of empirical studies.","search engines , scientometrics , bibliometrics , bibliographies , scientific papers , citation analysis , impact analysis , empirical analysis , bibliometrics , bibliographic data bases , scholarly publishing , discovery tools , search engines","enrique orduna-malea, alberto martin-martin, emilio delgado lopez-cozar",google scholar as a source for scholarly evaluation a bibliographic review of database errors,revista espanola de documentacion cientifica

The current research adopted four indicators to compare the quality of OA and non-OA journals indexed in Scopus under each subject area, namely citedness rate, CiteScore, SNIP and SJR. Findings OA journals comprised approximately 17 per cent out of the total journals indexed by Scopus in 2015. The results revealed an uneven spread of OA journals across disciplines, ranged from 5.5 to 28.7 per cent. Studying the quality of journals as measured by CiteScore, SJR SNIP leads us to the finding that, in all research areas, except for health profession and nursing, non-OA journals attain statistically significant higher average quality than do OA journals.

The goal is to contribute to the understanding of Twitter as a new altmetric measure for assessing impact of research articles. In this paper, we extended the previous study of tweet motivations by finding out the profiles of twitter users. In particular, we examined six characteristics of users: gender, geographic distribution, academic, non-academic, individual, and organization. Out of several, we would like to highlight here three key findings. First, a great majority of users (86%) were from North America and Europe indicating the possibility that, if in general, tweets for research articles are mainly in English, Twitter as an alternative metric has a Western bias. Second, several previous altmetrics studies suggested that tweets, and altmetrics in general, do not indicate scholarly impact due to their low correlation with citation counts. This study provides further details in this aspect by revealing that most tweets (77%) were by individual users, 67% of whom were nonacademic. Therefore, tweets mostly reflect impact of research articles on the general public, rather than on academia. Finally, analysis from profiles and motivations showed that the majority of tweets (from 42% to 57%) in all user types highlighted the summary or findings of the article indicating that tweets are a new way of communicating research findings.","social networks , informetrics , motivation , information sharing","tint hlahla htoo, na jin-cheon",who are tweeting research articles and why,journal of information science theory and practice

Mendeley readership has been identified as one of the most important altmetric sources, with several features that are similar to citations. The purpose of this paper is to perform an in-depth analysis of the differences and similarities between the distributions of Mendeley readership and citations across fields. Design/methodology/approach The authors analyze two issues by using in each case a common analytical framework for both metrics: the shape of the distributions of readership and citations, and the field normalization problem generated by differences in citation and readership practices across fields. In the first issue the authors use the characteristic scores and scales method, and in the second the measurement framework introduced in Crespo et al. (2013). Findings There are three main results. First, the citations and Mendeley readership distributions exhibit a strikingly similar degree of skewness in all fields. Second, the results on “exchange rates (ERs)” for Mendeley readership empirically supports the possibility of comparing readership counts across fields, as well as the field normalization of readership distributions using ERs as normalization factors. Third, field normalization using field mean readerships as normalization factors leads to comparably good results. Originality/value These findings open up challenging new questions, particularly regarding the possibility of obtaining conflicting results from field normalized citation and Mendeley readership indicators; this suggests the need for better determining the role of the two metrics in capturing scientific recognition.","citation analysis , impact analysis , web 2.0 , citations , scientometrics , currencies , hegemony , informetrics , publications","rodrigo costas, antonio perianes-rodriguez, javier ruiz-castillo",on the quest for currencies of science,aslib journal of information management

However, many researchers are still not making their data available, one of the reasons being that this activity is not adequately recognized in the current reward system of science. Since the attribution of data sets to individual researchers is necessary if we are to include them in research evaluation processes, the purpose of this paper is to explore the feasibility of linking data set records from DataCite to the authors of articles indexed in the Web of Science. Design/methodology/approach DataCite and WoS records are linked together based on the similarity between the names of the data sets’ creators and the articles’ authors, as well as the similarity between the noun phrases in the titles of the data sets and the titles and abstract of the articles. Findings The authors report that a large number of DataCite records can be attributed to specific authors in WoS, and the authors demonstrate that the prevalence of data sharing varies greatly depending on the research discipline. Originality/value It is yet unclear how data sharing can provide adequate recognition for individual researchers. Bibliometric indicators are commonly used for research evaluation, but to date no large-scale assessment of individual researchers’ data sharing activities has been carried out.","researchers , similarity , citations , datasets , science , bibliometrics , informetrics , information sharing , data retrieval , publishing , data sets","philippe mongeon, nicolas robinson-garcia, wei jeng, rodrigo costas",incorporating data sharing to the reward system of science,aslib journal of information management

Web-based communities, facilitated by the adoption of social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are increasingly being used for knowledge dissemination, bridging the gap between knowledge generation and synthesis and knowledge implementation. Objective Our objective was to implement and evaluate a structured social media strategy, using multiple platforms, to disseminate Cochrane Child Health evidence to health care providers caring for children. Methods Our social media strategy had three components: daily “tweets” using the Cochrane Child Health Twitter account, weekly WordPress blog posts, and a monthly journal club on Twitter (“tweet chat”). Each tweet, blog, and journal club shared Cochrane evidence on a child health topic. We evaluated the strategy through (1) Twitter and blog site analytics, (2) traceable link (Bitly) statistics, (3) Altmetric.com scores for promoted evidence, and (4) participant feedback. We also tracked the resources required to write the blog, tweet content, and manage the strategy. Results The 22-week social media strategy ran between November 2014 and April 2015. We created 25 blog posts, sent 585 tweets, and hosted 3 tweet chats. Monthly blog visits and views and Twitter account followers increased over time. During the study period, the blog received 2555 visitors and 3967 page views from a geographically diverse audience of health care providers, academics, and health care organizations. In total, 183 traceable Bitly links received 3463 clicks, and the Twitter account gained 469 new followers. The most visited and viewed blog posts included gastrointestinal topics (lactose avoidance), research on respiratory conditions (honey for cough and treatments for asthma), and maternal newborn care (skin-to-skin contact). On Twitter, popular topics were related to public health (vaccination) and pain management. We collected Altmetric.com scores for 61 studies promoted during the study period and recorded an average increase of 11 points. Research staff (n=3) contributed approximately 433 hours to promotion activities and planning (6.5 hours each per week) to implement the social media strategy, and study investigators reviewed all content (blog posts and tweets). Conclusions This study provides empirical evidence on the use of a coordinated social media strategy for the dissemination of evidence to professionals providing health services to children and youth. The results and lessons learned from our study provide guidance for future knowledge dissemination activities using social media tools.","asthma , feedback , childrens health , pain , avoidance , public health , health promotion , cough reflex , averages , academic staff , skin contact , internet , guidance , health services , immunization , attitudes , decision making , dissemination , visitors , social networks , computer based , informetrics , topics , children , information dissemination , medical personnel , caregiving , social media","michele p phd dyson, amanda s rn newton, kassi msc shave, robin m mlis featherstone, denise msc thomson, aireen mph wingert, ricardo m md fernandes, lisa msc hartling",social media for the dissemination of cochrane child health evidence evaluation study,journal of medical internet research

Design/methodology/approach An evaluative informetric research approach was used to compare 134 health and medical (H&amp;M) journals hosted in the African Journals Online (AJOL) database. Harzing's Publish or Perish (PoP) software was used to extract the following publication and citation data from Google Scholar: citation counts, number of papers and the h-index of the journals. Three null hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. Findings A total of 65 open access (OA) and 69 non-OA H&amp;M journals of African origin were found in AJOL. Only 20 African countries have journals hosted in AJOL, with more than 53% of them from Nigeria and 13.4% from South Africa. Findings reveal that non-OA H&amp;M journals performed poorly in terms of citations compared with their OA counterparts. The t -test analysis revealed high significant difference in the citations and research impacts of OA and non-OA H&amp;M journals published in Africa. Practical implications The study will assist in collection development in medical and health libraries globally and in Africa particularly. The study will also be a useful guide to journal publishers, health researchers and health workers providing information on where to publish and the journals to subscribe. Social implications Apart from adding to the body of knowledge in scholarly communication in Africa, this study will go a long way in influencing policies in H&amp;M research in Africa. Originality/value AJOL is the only online database hosting journals from all countries in Africa. Unfortunately, the quality and research impact of the journals in the database have not been adequately investigated. The paper adopted an informetric approach to evaluate H&amp;M journals in Africa so as to provide wider insight on the contents and quality of the journals hosted in it.","citation analysis , scholars , accessibility , libraries , journals , health , medical research , scientific papers , open access publishing , journals , citation analysis , medical libraries , scholarly communication , public health , databases , africa","ifeanyi jonas ezema, omwoyo bosire onyancha",citation impact of health and medical journals in africa does open accessibility matter,the electronic library

En el contexto de la tercera etapa -de “internacionalización”- se profundiza el estudio observando en detalle algunas inconsistencias de las nuevas políticas de México y Colombia (2016), con relación a los objetivos regionales de las dos primeras etapas -la emergente y la de consolidación. Se resalta cómo estas políticas señalan un cambio de discurso y enfoque que pone a las citaciones como la medida más valorada. Se reflexiona finalmente acerca de los nuevos rumbos de evaluación de revistas científicas de la región , tanto avances como retrocesos, respecto a las primeras etapas.

The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether this feature is able to identify and normalize all the institutions entered by the authors, and whether it is able to assign all researchers to their own institution correctly. Design/methodology/approach Systematic queries to GSC's internal search box were performed under two different forms (institution name and institutional e-mail web domain) in September 2015. The whole Spanish academic system (82 institutions) was used as a test. Additionally, specific searches to companies (Google) and world-class universities were performed to identify and classify potential errors in the functioning of the feature. Findings Although the affiliation tool works well for most institutions, it is unable to detect all existing institutions in the database, and it is not always able to create a unique standardized entry for each institution. Additionally, it also fails to group all the authors who belong to the same institution. A wide variety of errors have been identified and classified. Research limitations/implications Even though the analyzed sample is good enough to empirically answer the research questions initially proposed, a more comprehensive study should be performed to calibrate the real volume of the errors. Practical implications The discovered affiliation link errors prevent institutions from being able to access the profiles of all their respective authors using the institutions lists offered by GSC. Additionally, it introduces a shortcoming in the navigation features of Google Scholar which may impair web user experience. Social implications Some institutions (mainly universities) are under-represented in the affiliation feature provided by GSC. This fact might jeopardize the visibility of institutions as well as the use of this feature in bibliometric or webometric analyses. Originality/value This work proves inconsistencies in the affiliation feature provided by GSC. A whole national university system is systematically analyzed and several queries have been used to reveal errors in its functioning. The completeness of the errors identified and the empirical data examined are the most exhaustive to date regarding this topic. Finally, some recommendations about how to correctly fill in the affiliation data (both for authors and institutions) and how to improve this feature are provided as well.","search engines , citations , scientometrics , bibliometrics , queries , lists , scientific papers , information professionals , social networks , visibility , researchers , empirical analysis , informetrics , search engines , social research , information science","enrique orduna-malea, juan m ayllon, alberto martin-martin, emilio delgado lopez-cozar",the lost academic home institutional affiliation links in google scholar citations,online information review

Design/methodology/approach The geographical summary of Frontiers articles displays the number of visits and categorizes where the visitors hail from. This study uses the records of 23,798 articles published in 16 Frontiers journals from 2007 to 2015 to analyse the geographical distribution of article visits at both country and city levels. The process of knowledge diffusion is investigated on the basis of the different visiting patterns of new and old papers. Findings Most article visits are concentrated around major metropolitan areas and some high-tech clusters. The top ""visiting countries"" include both developed countries and developing countries, and the USA and China are two major players. Publishing cities dominate article visits for new papers; as time passes, there is diffusion from the publishing cities to a broader area. Research limitations/implications The data on visiting for open access articles may be generated from various repositories besides the publishers' websites; these data are ignored, as they are not significant enough to have much influence. There is also a lack of a basic theory in the data processing of outliers in the data set. In addition, only static results are given in this paper, as the data were collected on one day, for one time. A longer time period is necessary to track the dynamic diffusion process of the observations. Practical implications Introduction of usage data will propose a novel way to analyse research activities and track knowledge diffusion. Social implications The visiting data of articles offer a new way to investigate research activities at the city level in a detailed and timely manner, for the geographical distribution of research activities and the research resource allocation of a specific country to be explored. Originality/value This study measured the research activities of scientific papers by examining the usage data.

Using bibliometric and altmetric indicators, it seeks to analyze the impact and subsequent use of their scholarly works on social and scientific platforms. Fifty-five authors with the highest productivity were identified, based on the results of bibliometric studies on InfoLit carried out on both an international and Ibero-American scale in searches of major databases as well as publications collected in a Latin American wiki. Subsequently an analysis of bibliometric and altmetric indicators at the author and publication level was carried out, based on the results of searches on eight scientific platforms (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley, ORCID, IraLIS, E-LIS and EXIT), three social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and data provided by a commercial supplier (Altmetric.com). Overall we found a greater presence of authors in ResearchGate (58%), Academia.edu (51%) and Google Scholar (49%) as opposed to Mendeley (25%) and ORCID (18%). Furthermore, as to social platforms, the greatest potential influence lies with Facebook, due to its high number of followers ( / top 10 authors). In addition, an analysis with the Spearman rho statistic, shows among some sources and platforms, a low correlation between the number of citations in Google Scholar and readings in Mendeley (r = 382) and low negative for mentions in blogs (r = 0,-237), Google+ (r = 0, -214) and Twitter (r = 0, -183). In conclusion, both the productivity and the impact-visibility center on specific authors writing about InfoLit, and various measurement resources show that for these authors there is a positive two-way impact from bibliometric to altmetric and vice versa.","user training , scientometrics , bibliometrics , information literacy , social networks , scientific papers , indicators , visibility , impact analysis , productivity , platforms , informetrics , search engines , social research , latin america","alejandro uribe-tirado, joel alhuay-quispe",estudio metrico de alfin en iberoamerica de la bibliometria a las altmetrics,revista espanola de documentacion cientifica

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire, based on one used previously in the USA, was sent to UK academics involved in LIS teaching and research. The questionnaire asked respondents to rate the importance of 87 LIS journals, to suggest others that were of importance to them but that were not amongst the 87, and to identify the five most prestigious journals for promotion purposes. In addition, those journals were identified that had figured in institutional submissions to the LIS Unit of Assessment in Research Excellence Framework (REF). Findings While there was a fair measure of overall agreement between US and UK rankings of the 87 journals, with both highlighting the standing of the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology and of the Journal of Documentation , some substantial differences were also noted. Evidence is presented for a strong locational component to academics' assessments of journal prestige, and analysis of the REF2014 submissions demonstrates the highly inter-disciplinary nature of LIS research in the UK. Research limitations/implications The sample size is small, comprising 30 completed responses.

The scholarly community of today’s knowledge society communicates between each other in a non-traditional way besides the traditional way. The arrival of web 2.0 and scientists’ gradual use of said platforms as tools for the diffusion and receipt of scientific information and with part of the scientific community relatively receptive, that scientometrics 2.0 began to be discussed. Another milestone in the era of scientometrics 2.0 is the ‘Wikimetrics’. After the ‘Wikimetrics’ next footprint comes with the advent of ‘Article-level metrics’. Article-level metrics followed by Altmetrics, i.e. Alternative Metrics. The term altmetrics was coined by Jason Priem in 2010, as a generalization of article level metrics, and rooted in the twitter #altmetrics hashtag. Although altmetrics usually functions as metrics about articles, but it can also be applied to people, journals, books, data sets, presentations, videos, source code repositories, web pages, etc. Altmetrics does not cover just citation counts, but also other aspects of the impact of a work, such as how many data and knowledge bases refer to it, article views, download, or mentions in social media and news media. In this paper, the altmetric scores of top-cited altmetric papers are presented. Also, the contents of the same are analysed and presented. It is interesting to note that all top-cited papers appeared from diverse subject domains, i.e. big data in science, biological science, medical science, research methodology, social studies, citation studies and scientometrics, different issues involved in social networking et al. The subject domain altmetrics is a highly interdisciplinary field covering all major areas of universe of knowledge. This study reflects other notable feature, i.e. the discord between traditional metric (times cited) and modern metric (altmetric score).","social networks , web 2.0 , scientometrics , informetrics , social research","dyuti samanta, bidyarthi dutta",altmetrics six years of changing scholarly appraisal,srels journal of information management

The results indicate that evaluators maintain traditional attitudes and opinions in both the choice of the journal where they themselves publish and the process of evaluating the research output of their peers. The journal peer-review process, publishing prestige, impact factor and presence in international and regional indexes are highly valued. But the open access journal model is not considered as a key factor in either their decisions about their own publications or in their evaluation of other researchers. The positive opinion about publishing in OA increases with the evaluator's age. It is promising that 61% of evaluators have published at least one open access article in the last five years and they give greater importance to this aspect when evaluating their peers.","research , journals , bibliometrics , professional development , documents , open access publishing , researchers , scholarly publishing , argentina","paola bongiovani, sandra miguel, tony hernandez-perez",actitudes y percepciones de los evaluadores de la carrera cientifica en argentina sobre la publicacion en acceso abierto,revista espanola de documentacion cientifica

Design/methodology/approach Facebook posts citing psychological journal papers were collected for both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A content analysis approach was adopted to investigate topic preferences and motivations for scholarly discussions among academic and non-academic Facebook users. Findings Non-academic users were more actively engaged in scholarly discussions on Facebook than academic users. Among 1,711 Facebook users in the sample, 71.4 percent of them belonged to non-academic users, while 28.6 percent were from an academic background. The Facebook users cited psychological articles with various motivations: discussion and evaluation toward articles (20.4 percent), application to real life practices (16.5 percent), self-promotion (6.4 percent), and data source exchange (6.0 percent). However, nearly half of the posts (50.1 percent) were simply sharing articles without additional user comments. These results implicate that Facebook metric (a count of mentions of a research article on Facebook), as an important source of altmetrics, better reflects the attitudes or perceptions of the general public instead of academia. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by enriching the understanding of Facebook metric as an academic and non-academic impact assessment tool for scientific publication.

The concept of attention is applied in two altmetric studies concerning: (1) the use of social media tools on the web pages of scientific journals, and indications of attention in these pages received, and (2) attention received by the radio news on the web page of an indigenous radio station. The purpose is to reveal characteristics of web publications connected to the attention they receive. Method. Altmetric data describing attention data was compiled from the Facebook sites of scientific journals and the Facebook pages of an indigenous radio station news programme, as well as the news programme's web site. The study was both quantitative and qualitative. Analysis. Attention was operationalized in the form of comments, likes or sharing of Facebook postings and these were analyzed quantitatively. The contents of the postings were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results. The characteristics of the postings receiving most attention were relevance, community (in the sense of ownership), belonging and co-creation, and engagement in the meaning of interactivity. Conclusions. In altmetric research, data originating from several sources can reflect the societal impact a project or a publication may have, not only the impact it has in science. Attention economy theory supports the interpretation of altmetric data.","social networks , radio stations , informetrics","terttu kortelainen, mari katvala, anni-siiri lansman",attention and altmetrics,information research

OAMJs, such as PLOS ONE , are large scale, broad scope journals that operate an open access business model (normally based on article-processing charges), and which employ a novel form of peer review, focussing on scientific “soundness” and eschewing judgement of novelty or importance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the discourses relating to OAMJs, and their place within scholarly publishing, and considers attitudes towards mega-journals within the academic community. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a review of the literature of OAMJs structured around four defining characteristics: scale, disciplinary scope, peer review policy, and economic model. The existing scholarly literature was augmented by searches of more informal outputs, such as blogs and e-mail discussion lists, to capture the debate in its entirety. Findings While the academic literature relating specifically to OAMJs is relatively sparse, discussion in other fora is detailed and animated, with debates ranging from the sustainability and ethics of the mega-journal model, to the impact of soundness-only peer review on article quality and discoverability, and the potential for OAMJs to represent a paradigm-shifting development in scholarly publishing. Originality/value This paper represents the first comprehensive review of the mega-journal phenomenon, drawing not only on the published academic literature, but also grey, professional and informal sources. The paper advances a number of ways in which the role of OAMJs in the scholarly communication environment can be conceptualised.","journals , journals , science , scale (ratio) , debates , open access publishing , social networks , business , economic analysis , economic models , scholarly publishing , ethical standards , scholarly communication , quality , literature reviews , united kingdom--uk","valerie spezi, simon wakeling, stephen pinfield, claire creaser, jenny fry, peter willett",open access mega journals,journal of documentation

We used multiple sources to extract data for the study, namely, Altmetric.com, Google Scholar (GS), Scopus (through SCImago) and the Thomson Reuters (TR) Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Data was analysed to determine South African journals' presence in and impact on SM as well as to contrast SM visibility and impact with the citation impact in GS, JCR and Scopus. The Spearman correlation test was performed to compare the impact of the journals on SM and other sources. The results reveal that 2923 articles published in 122 of the 273 South African (SA) journals have received at least one mention in SM; the most commonly used SM platforms were Twitter and Facebook; the journals indexed in the TR's citation indexes and Scopus performed much better, in terms of their average altmetrics, than non-TR and non-Scopus indexed journals; and there were weak to moderate relationships among different types of altmetrics and citation-based measures, thereby implying different kinds of journal impacts on SM when compared to the scholarly impact reflected in citation databases. In conclusion, South African journals' impact on SM, just as is the case with countries with similar economies, is minimal but has shown signs of growth.","bibliometrics , journals , social network analysis , secondary education , journals (academic) , higher education , south africa",omwoyo bosire onyancha,altmetrics of south african journals implications for scholarly impact of south african research,publishing research quarterly

Unlike the subscriber-pays traditional publishing model, the inherent interest in charging authors APCs as publication costs to have their work peer reviewed by experts in their field raises many concerns including the potential abuse by predatory publishers who may spot opportunities for profit, the objectivity and credibility of peer review, and the viability of this model in the light of rapidly evolving publishing practices and venues. In this piece, we discuss some challenges that may threaten the survival of the author-pays journal publishing model, evolving the ""publish or perish"" into a ""pay to publish or perish"" model.","writers , peer review , credibility , publishing industry , fees & charges , open access , journals (academic) , physicians , credibility , education policy , patients , verbal aggression , united states--us , japan","aceil al-khatib, jaime a da silva, teixeira",threats to the survival of the author pays journal to publish model,publishing research quarterly

Design/methodology/approach This study uses three approaches to understand the current richness and future potential of ten altmetric measures in nine selected disciplines: first, investigate the distribution and trend of altmetric data; second, verify the relationship between citation rate and altmetric presence of the discipline using Pearson correlation; and third, perform word frequency analysis on tweets to understand different altmetric presence in different disciplines. In addition, this study uses Spearman and sign test to find the correlation between altmetrics and citation counts for the articles that receive altmetric mention(s) to test the validity of altmetrics as indicators of research impact. Findings There is a steady increase in the number of articles that receive altmetric mentions in all disciplines studied. In general, disciplines with higher citation rates have higher altmetric presence. At the same time, altmetrics are also an effective complement to citation in disciplines with low citation rates. There is a moderate correlation with Mendeley and significant but weak correlations with Tweets and CiteULike in seven disciplines. Altmetrics appear effective as a predictor of citation counts in seven out of nine disciplines studied. However, there is low presence and lack of correlation with citation count in business-finance and law disciplines. Originality/value This paper furthers the understanding of altmetrics in social science disciplines. It reveals the disciplines where altmetrics are most effective, potentially useful, and fairly applicable.

Very little has been written about the faculty researcher perspective on metrics and, as a result, librarians may have a deep knowledge of the tools but have a more limited understanding of the users' viewpoint. Seventy-nine senior research faculty who were five or more years post-tenure were interviewed. Faculty from the Humanities, Social Sciences and Sciences were all invited to participate. Each interview consisted of nine questions relating to how the faculty understand and use impact metrics in their academic life. Responses were varied to all of the questions and were tied closely to the disciplinary fields of the research faculty interviewed. A large majority of the interviewed faculty viewed the library as a key resource for getting more information relating to metrics. This research reveals a need to fill a gap between librarians and faculty researchers with examples of disciplinary best practices of metrics use, as well as product information as pertains to impact metrics.","research , citations , productivity , bibliometrics , academic libraries , product information , researchers , librarians , impact factors , informetrics , interviews , hirsch index , scholarly communication , college faculty","mindy thuna, pam king",research impact metrics a faculty perspective,partnership

However, no study has focused on their potential usefulness to capture the impact of scholarly books. While recent literature shows that citation indicators cannot fully capture the impact of books, other studies have suggested alternative indicators such as usage, publishers’ prestige or library holdings. In this paper, we calculate 18 indicators which range from altmetrics to library holdings, views, downloads or citations to the production of monographs of a Spanish university using the bibliometric suite PlumX from EBSCO. The objective of the study is to adopt a multidimensional perspective on the analysis of books and understand the level of complementarity between these different indicators. Also, we compare the overview offered by this range of indicators when applied to monographs with the traditional bibliometric perspective focused on journal articles and citation impact. We observe a low presence of altmetric indicators for monographs, even lower than for journal articles and a predominance of library holdings, confirming this indicator as the most promising one towards the analysis of the impact of books.","indicators , indicators , impact analysis , monographs , libraries , bibliometrics , informetrics , books , books , complementarity , books , citations , colleges & universities","daniel torres-salinas, nicolas robinson-garcia, juan gorraiz",filling the citation gap measuring the multidimensional impact of the academic book at institutional level with plumx,scientometrics

First, the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database is investigated, overall and across disciplines. Second, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is used to determine the association of various factors with increasing or decreasing citations. Lastly, the effectiveness of altmetric indices to identify publications with high citation impact is comprehensively evaluated by deploying area under the curve (AUC)—an application of receiver operating characteristic. Results indicate a rapid increase in the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database from 10.19% in 2011 to 20.46% in 2015. It was found that Blog count was the most important factor in the field of Health Professions and Nursing as it increased the number of citations by 38.6%, followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field of Physics and Astronomy. The results of receiver operating characteristic show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.725 between highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings suggest that altmetrics can be used to distinguish highly cited publications. The implications of this research are significant in many different directions. Firstly, they set the basis for a further investigation of altmetrics efficiency to predict publications impact and most significantly promote new insights for the measurement of research outcome dissemination over social media.","databases , data management , data processing , astronomy , social networks , physics , astronomy , documents , social networks , citation analysis , data bases , informetrics , nursing , digital media , citation analysis , databases","saeed-ul hassan, mubashir imran, uzair gillani, naif radi aljohani, timothy d bowman, fereshteh didegah",measuring social media activity of scientific literature an exhaustive comparison of scopus and novel altmetrics big data,scientometrics

Harris (2016) used the trends and issues reported by the ACRL to inform a document and thematic analysis of publications written on Jamaican academic librarianship 2010-2016, to investigate the trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. Harris’ (2016) paper however noted that a survey of the chief librarian in each library, regarding their perceptions of the trends and issues would be a useful follow-up to her study, and cited this as a limitation/implication of her paper. The purpose of this paper is to address the above limitation and is therefore the follow-up to Harris’ (2016) paper. Design/methodology/approach The chief librarians in five of the six local university libraries were surveyed to provide insights into the trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries at the university level. Findings Acquisitions, budget, staffing, communicating value, digital preservation and curation, mobile environment, collaboration, scholarly communication, information technology, space, higher education, user behaviour and expectations and information literacy are the top trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries at the university level. Research limitations/implications This survey seeks to complement rather than contest Harris’ (2016) research. Perhaps a useful follow-up to both papers would be biennial updates. Additionally, a survey of the trends and issues in all types of academic libraries throughout the English-speaking Caribbean would be a useful follow-up. Originality/value This paper is of value, as it is the first survey of trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. It enriches the existing document and thematic analytical research on trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries by adding an empirical component. It also increases the number of publications, on trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship, from one to two, and allows voices from the English-speaking Caribbean (Jamaica) to be incorporated into the literature dedicated to trends and issues in academic libraries.","user services , higher education , academic libraries , trends , chief librarians , integrated library systems-ils , open access publishing , library collections , access to information , internet resources , information technology , scholarly communication , access to materials , jamaica",sasekea harris,2016 top trends and issues in jamaican academic libraries,information and learning science

The results reveal severe limitations in the use of Wikipedia citations for research evaluation. Lack of standardization and incompleteness of Wikipedia references make it difficult to retrieve them. The number of Wikipedia citations is very low, with less than 3% of articles in the sample having been cited. A significant number of references are cited in biographical entries about the authors of the articles, resulting in a phenomenon of accumulated advantage, which is similar to the Matthew effect. Nearly one-third of the Wikipedia citations link to an open access source, although this result is probably an underestimate of open access availability, given the incompleteness of Wikipedia citations.","library and information science , standardization , libraries , case studies , citations , standardization , open access , case studies","aida pooladian, angel borrego",methodological issues in measuring citations in wikipedia a case study in library and information science,scientometrics

Primary outcome measures included citation count and Altmetric ® scores (a composite score measuring attention in news, blogs, Twitter ® , and Facebook ® ). Two hundred and forty two RCTs were included in the final analysis. Trial characteristics that were positive predictors of citation count included investigation of Hepatitis C treatment ( r &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.35, p &#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), private funding ( r &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.24, p &#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), mortality-related endpoint ( r &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.22, p &#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), and research setting within the United States ( r &#xa0;=&#xa0;0.13, p &#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001).

At present, MOST primarily considers Clarivate Analytics journal impact factor (JIF), which is a proprietary scientometric measure, as a measure of “quality”. Academic publishing is however, starting to move away from metrics such as the JIF that can be gamed, and that do not truly reflect the academic worth of individual scientists, or of journals. Metrics such as altmetrics, which show the paper’s popularity among social media, or a greater balance of metrics, to buffer the monopolized impact of the JIF on metrics-based rewards systems, may be issues that China and MOST need to consider as global academic publishing tends towards a state of open science where open access journals that reach a wider audience may have greater value than journals with a high JIF. Not only are China’s academics well-funded by the state, the Chinese academic market is a highly coveted market by publishers and other parties interested in advancing their academic or commercial interests. Given the current fluid and rapidly evolving state of academic publishing, and the fairly rigid JIF-based rewards system in place in China at the moment, coupled with a recent spate in academic misconduct from Chinese researchers, this letter offers some suggestions as to the need for China to rethink its policies regarding what factors influence academic rewards.","markets , scientometrics , scholarly publishing , upgrading , digital media , policies , scientists , china",jaime a. teixeira da silva,does china need to rethink its metrics and citation based research rewards policies,scientometrics

An outlier sample includes 104 authors with high values. A Nobel sample comprises 73 Nobel winners from Medicine and Physiology, Chemistry, Physics and Economics (from 1975 to 2015). A longitudinal sample includes weekly data on 4 authors with different RG Scores. The results suggest that high RG Scores are built primarily from activity related to asking and answering questions in the site. In particular, it seems impossible to get a high RG Score solely through publications. Within RG it is possible to distinguish between (passive) academics that interact little in the site and active platform users, who can get high RG Scores through engaging with others inside the site (questions, answers, social networks with influential researchers). Thus, RG Scores should not be mistaken for academic reputation indicators.","social networks , promotion , recruitment , recruitment , researchers , social organization , social networks , physics , documents , bibliometrics","enrique orduna-malea, alberto martin-martin, mike thelwall, emilio delgado lopez-cozar",do researchgate scores create ghost academic reputations,scientometrics

Our results show that contrary to a random sample of Twitter users, users who tweet academic articles describe themselves more factually and by emphasizing their occupational expertise rather than personal interests. The more field-specific the articles were, the more research-related descriptions dominated in Twitter profile descriptions.

However, information literacy spans far beyond the traditional ability to find, access, evaluate, use, and properly cite information. It also encompasses the ability to evaluate the impact of scholarship, determine appropriate data-management practices, understand author rights, promote ethical use of scholarship, and maintain an awareness of changes in scholarly communication. Between 2010 and 2016 librarians at Virginia Tech have focused on developing programs to strengthen several of these information literacy skills across the continuum of students, faculty, and extension agents in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS). Starting with undergraduates, traditional information literacy skills were incorporated into the two CALS First-Year Experience programs. A scientific writing workshop and online information literacy course were designed for CALS graduate students. Extension agents and faculty were introduced to both traditional and more advanced applications to explore how changes in the information landscape impacts their work. This paper will discuss how these librarians have partnered to create and promote these information literacy initiatives.","librarians , college campuses , skills , skill development , academic libraries , agriculture , life sciences , departments , community , graduate students , information literacy , scholarly communication , user training , ethics , literacy , agriculture , college students , audience , academic discourse , virginia","kyrille goldbeck debose, inga haugen, rebecca k miller",information literacy instruction programs supporting the college of agriculture and life sciences community at virginia tech,library trends

Conceivably, they might also be used to supplement other methods for estimating journal readership. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of Mendeley reference management software to characterize the features of the readership of library and information science (LIS) literature. Design/methodology/approach The authors used the Social Sciences Citation Index to retrieve 54,655 articles and reviews published between 1995 and 2014 and indexed in the category ""Information Science &amp; Library Science"". Each record was then searched in Mendeley to obtain the number of bookmarks of the paper and the academic status of the users. Findings Mendeley covers 61 per cent of the LIS literature published in the last 20 years. In all, 75 per cent of the papers published in the last five years had been bookmarked at least once in Mendeley whereas just 55 per cent had been cited in Web of Science. Reviews are bookmarked more frequently than articles, and papers in English have more bookmarks than papers in any other language. Most users of LIS literature are PhD and postgraduate students. Originality/value The study shows that altmetrics can be used as a source of data in information behaviour studies. Reference management software provides an unobtrusive means of capturing reading habits in the scholarly literature. Compared to citation counts, bookmarks are rapidly available and also reflect usage outside the academic community.","social networks , scholars , academic libraries , librarians , library collections , science , social research , studies , social sciences , publications , citation analysis , management decisions , researchers , journals , citation management software , collection management , information seeking behavior , informetrics , library and information science , publication output , scholarly communication , use statistics , libraries , citation analysis , postgraduate , information management , software , spain","aida pooladian, angel borrego",twenty years of readership of library and information science literature under mendeleys microscope,performance measurement and metrics

The purpose of this paper is to measure and compare the impact of Korean study results in four fields that were published in international journals using altmetrics. Design/methodology/approach This study analysed the impact of 383 Korean research articles published by international journals in the field of medical science, engineering, social science and arts and humanities through altmetrics and compared it with bibliometrics. Findings As a result, the frequency of research articles which are ""discussed"" through social media such as Twitter was shown to be highest in the medical science than in other fields. In addition, the frequency of research articles which were ""saved"" through reference management tool such as Mendeley was shown to be higher in the social science and the arts and humanities than in other fields. Furthermore, as a result of a correlation analysis between altmetrics and bibliometrics, it is found that there exists a positive correlation between the number of articles which were ""saved"" in Mendeley and ""cited"" in follow-up studies. Originality/value This study examined the impact of the articles originating in non-English-speaking nations; it could be referred by other non-English-speaking nations that are trying to identify invisible impact of their research output on global society.

ReserachGate is a rich source of altmetric indictors such as publications, reads, profile views, citations, impact points, RGScore, followers and following, etc. The RGScore, unique to ResearchGate, was further explored in depth in the study. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected manually by visiting the profile pages of all the members who had an account in ResearchGate under Univ.Delhi P&amp;A during the first week of July, 2016. The authors found a total of 173 members in ResearchGate from the department. Data were collected for publications, reads, profile views, citations, impact points, RGScore, followers and following from the profile pages of the members. Correlations were calculated amongst the metrics provided by ResearchGate to seek the nature of the relationship amongst the various ResearchGate metrics. Findings The analysis revealed that the publications added by researchers to their profiles were relatively low, as 28.32 per cent of the members had not added even a single publication to their profiles. Average reads acquired per person was found to be 909.49 and the median value of reads was found to be 95. Average citation per member in ResearchGate was found to be 414.60 and the median value was found to be 7. Majority of the researchers (45.09 per cent) had impact points in the range of 0.2-50. Most of the members (35.84 per cent) had followers in the range of 1-10. Majority of the members (52.02 per cent) had profile views in the range of 1-100. Most of the members (26.01 per cent) had RGScore equivalent to 0.01. The highest correlation of RGScore was found with publications added by researchers to their profiles, followed by correlation between RGScore and reads, correlation between RGscore and profile views, correlation between RGScore and number of Full Texts and correlation between RGScore and number of followers of a researcher. Originality/value Not much research has been conducted in the area of altmetrics, especially using ResearchGate as a source of altmetrics. The findings of the study help in understanding the validity of ResearchGate as a source of altmetrics for research evaluation in a developing country such as India. Also, the novel ResearchGate indicator RGScore has been evaluated in great depth and its relationship with other ResearchGate altmetric and bibliometric indicators has been established.","studies , social networks , academic libraries , scholarly publishing , social research , publications , bibliometrics , scholars , researchers , informetrics , institutional repositories , scholarly communication , web 2.0 , followers , correlation , documents , astrophysics , developing nations , india","rishabh shrivastava, preeti mahajan",an altmetric analysis of researchgate profiles of physics researchers,performance measurement and metrics

What this research focuses on is; with the use of the open source project ‘Depsy’, this research evaluated and analyzed data collected from downloads made online through these open source software. Altmetrics cannot be confined to traditional measurable indicators. That the importance of the open source software used, and its position in the online community is itself a strong measure for academic impact and success, which is all too often overlooked in research. The research can also conclude that the multiplexing of software online, through the citation of a citation, ultimately leads to an online peered review system within the community, effectively developing and maintaining through open use software itself. Moreover, the benefits of such a system has only just begun to come to fruition, having a strong impact on academic research, and predicting research impact.","position measurement , data processing , web 2.0 , computer programs , community relations , open source software , software , on-line systems , indicators , free flow , multiplexing , informetrics , impact prediction , evaluation , software , internet , freeware , citation analysis , researchers","rongying zhao, mingkun wei",impact evaluation of open source software an altmetrics perspective,scientometrics

In this Short Communication, we outline that the current revolution in scientometrics does not only imply a broadening of the impact perspective, but also the devaluation of quality considerations in evaluative contexts. Impact might no longer be seen as a proxy for quality, but in its original sense: the simple resonance in some sectors of society.","taxonomy , scientometrics , taxonomy , vocabularies & taxonomies","lutz bornmann, robin haunschild",does evaluative scientometrics lose its main focus on scientific quality by the new orientation towards societal impact,scientometrics

This is a descriptive observational evaluation study based on a sample of 24 journals included in the emergency medicine category of the Journal Citation Reports 2015. The sample is evaluated based on seven evaluation indicators: Journal Citation Reports impact factor, three H-indices (Web of Science, Scimago and Google Scholar), the Scimago Journal Rank and two altmetric scores (3-month and any time). The bivariate correlations between the diverse distributions of evaluation indicators and a multivariate metric reliability index are calculated. The factorial structure of the indicators is explored and clusters of journals are defined. A factor score is assigned to each journal. The correlations between the seven evaluation indicators are high and statistically significant. The metric reliability of the multivariate analysis calculated using Cronbach’s alpha is .97. A general factor explains the 84.64% variance of the factor space of the seven evaluation indicators, representing the ‘quality of EM journals’ construct. The most well-represented indicator, the one with the highest communality, is H_Index_WoS ( h &#xa0;=&#xa0;.922), which is also the indicator with the greatest weight in the general factor ( a &#xa0;=&#xa0;.96). The journals can be classified in four clusters according to their quality. A factor score is generated for each journal that could be used as a multivariate meta-index to evaluate journal quality and to define a ranking of journals.","reliability analysis , emergency medical care , well construction , emergency medical services , journals , scientific papers , multivariate analysis , indicators , indicators , citation analysis , multivariate analysis , mathematical models , clusters , statistical analysis , bivariate analysis , evaluation , medicine , multivariate analysis , multivariate analysis , citation analysis , clustering , hirsch index","antonio fernandez-cano, ines m fernandez-guerrero",a multivariate model for evaluating emergency medicine journals,scientometrics

Using data from Altmetric, we study how many papers indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) are mentioned in policy-related documents. We find that less than 0.5% of the papers published in different subject categories are mentioned at least once in policy-related documents. Based on our results, we recommend that the analysis of (WoS) publications with at least one policy-related mention is repeated regularly (annually)&#xa0;in order to check the usefulness of the data.

The sample is all of the 32,962 papers PLoS published in 2014, with results suggesting that there are at least two important underlying factors, which could generally be described as Scientific Attention/Discussion (citations), General Attention/Discussion (views, tweets), and potentially Media Attention/Discussion (media mentions). The General Attention metric is correlated about .50 with both the Academic and Media factors, though the Academic and Media attention are only correlated with each other below .05. The overall best indicator of the dataset was the total lifetime views on the paper, which is also probably the easiest to game. The results indicate the need for funding bodies to decide what they value and how to measure it (e.g., types of attention, quality).","personality , personality , games , personality , correlation , media , funding , digital media , scientometrics , artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence","brett buttliere, jurgen buder",personalizing papers using altmetrics comparing paper quality or impact to person intelligence or personality,scientometrics

We discuss three basic issues inherent in using tweets for research evaluation: whose tweets can be used to assess a paper, what objects can be evaluated, and how to score the paper according to each tweet. We suggest that tweets written by those involved in publication of the paper in question should not be included in the paper’s evaluation. Tweets unrelated to the content of the paper should also be excluded. Because controversies in research are inevitable and difficult to resolve, we suggest omitting somewhat supportive and negative tweets in research evaluation. Logically, neutral tweets (such as those linking to, and excerpts from, papers) express a degree of compliment, agreement, interest, or surprise, albeit less so than the tweets explicitly expressing these sentiments. Recommendation tweets also reflect one or more of these sentiments. Expansion tweets, which are inspired by the papers, reflect the function of research. Therefore, we suggest giving a higher weight to praise, agreement, interest, surprise, recommendation and expansion tweets linking to an academic paper than neutral tweets when scoring a paper. Issues related to electronic publishing and social media as learned from tweets are also discussed.","social networks , scoring , social networks , media , scientific papers , evaluation , digital media , electronic publishing , sentiment analysis","xuan zhen liu, hui fang",what we can learn from tweets linking to research papers,scientometrics

The slides of a presentation from the Medical Library Association annual meeting were translated from English to Chinese, Japanese, and Russian and posted along with the English version to SlideShare, an open slide-hosting website. View counts, traffic sources, and geographic origins of the traffic for each language version were tracked over a twenty-two-month period. Total view counts for all 4 language versions amounted to 3,357 views, with the Chinese version accounting for 71% of the total views. The trends in view counts over time for the Japanese, Russian, and English versions were similar, with high interest at the beginning and a rapid drop and low level of viewing activity thereafter. The pattern of view counts for the Chinese version departed considerably from the other language versions, with very low activity at the beginning but a sharp rise 10 months later. This increase in activity was related to access to the presentations via a Taiwanese website that embedded the SlideShare website code. Language translation can be a difficult and time-consuming task. However, translation of a conference slide presentation with limited text is an achievable activity and engages an international audience for information that is often not noticed or lost. Although English is by far the primary language of science and other disciplines, it is not necessarily the first or preferred language of global researchers. By offering appropriate language versions, the authors of presentations can expand the reach of their work.","social networks , web sites , librarians , research , academic libraries , anglophones , audiences , presentations , bibliometrics , translations , conferences , researchers , russian language , informetrics , library associations , medical libraries , open access , united states--us , colorado","lilian phd hoffecker, dana mls abbey",from english to chinese japanese and russian extending research visibility with language translations of a conference slide presentation,journal of the medical library association

The advantage of using our base maps is that it is not necessary for the user to produce a network based on all data (e.g., from 1 year), but can collect the Mendeley data for a single institution (or journals, topics) and can match them with our already produced information. Generation of such large-scale networks is still a demanding task despite the available computer power and digital data availability.

296,Trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries 2010-2016,Scholarly Journals,sasekea harris,10.1108/nlw-08-2016-0055,Journal Article,11/12,English,2016,117," Academic libraries , Librarians , Science , Trends , Library associations , United States--US , Europe , Jamaica",,New Library World,,"Purpose Observing trends and issues plays a key role in the success of any industry. Since 2010, the Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL) has been publishing papers on top trends and issues in academic libraries in the USA, allowing for reflection, tracking, lesson drawing, adaptation, planning and direction. Such a publication is absent in the Jamaican library industry. This paper aims to examine the extent to which these trends and issues, as reported by ACRL, are evident in Jamaican academic librarianship. Design/methodology/approach Through document and thematic analysis of publications written on Jamaican academic librarianship 2010-2016, this paper highlights trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. Findings There are similarities in the trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship and American academic librarianship; the similarities sometimes vary, however, in focus. Additionally, there are trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship not mentioned in the literature reviewed on American academic librarianship and vice versa. Research limitations/implications A survey of the chief librarians' perceptions regarding the trends and issues would be a useful follow-up. Practical implications This paper allows for reflection, comparison, benchmarking, lesson-drawing, planning and direction for academic libraries and other types of libraries in Jamaica and the rest of the developing world. Social implications The gaps highlighted, particularly those with the most potential, can be discussed with the objective of exploring how these can be translated into new or revised services for the community of users. Originality/value This paper is of value, as there is no publication with an explicit focus on trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries; this paper will be the first publication on trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. In this regard, this paper makes an important contribution to the literature on academic librarianship generally, and to the literature on Caribbean and Jamaican academic librarianship, specifically.","academic libraries , librarians , science , trends , library associations , united states--us , europe , jamaica",sasekea harris,trends and issues in jamaican academic libraries 2010 2016,new library world

The purpose of this paper is to explore social tagging practices across four platforms in relation to cultural products associated with the book Casino Royale , by Ian Fleming. Design/methodology/approach A layered and nested case study approach was used to analyse data from four online platforms: Goodreads, Last.fm, WordPress, and public library social discovery platforms. The top-level case study focuses on the book Casino Royale , by Ian Fleming and its derivative products. The analysis of tagging practices in each of the four online platforms is nested within the top-level case study. Casino Royale was conceptualized as a cultural product (the book), its derived products (e.g. movies, theme songs), as well as a keyword in blogs. A qualitative, inductive, and context-specific approach was chosen to identify commonalities in tagging practices across platforms whilst taking into account the uniqueness of each platform. Findings The four platforms comprise different communities of users, each platform with its own cultural norms and tagging practices. Traditional access points in the library catalogues focused on the subject, location, and fictitious characters of the book. User-generated content across the four platforms emphasized historical events and periods related to the book, and highlighted more subjective access points, such as recommendations, tone, mood, reaction, and reading experience. Revealing shifts occur in the tags between the original book and its cultural derivatives: Goodreads and library catalogues focus almost exclusively on the book, while Last.fm and WordPress make in addition cross-references to a wider range of different cultural products, including books, movies, and music. The analyses also yield apparent similarities in certain platforms, such as recurring terms, phrasing and composite or multifaceted tags, as well as a strong presence of genre-related terms for the book and music. Originality/value The layered and nested case study approach presents a more comprehensive theoretical viewpoint and methodological framework by which to explore the study of user-generated metadata pertaining to a range of related cultural products across a variety of online platforms.","research , user-generated content , libraries , social networks , user behavior , library and information science , user generated content , researchers , illusions , norms , humanities , platforms , book reviews , library catalogs , social sciences , marking , books , music , tags , social networks , tagging , casinos , catalogs , canada , fleming, ian","nadine desrochers, audrey laplante, martin kim, anabel quan-haase, louise spiteri",illusions of a bond tagging cultural products across online platforms,journal of documentation

Discover barriers that prevent librarians from taking conference presentation to full publication. Assess the metrics available to librarians for scholarly output measurement by examining metrics, traditional and altmetrics, of articles resulting from conference presentation. Design/methodology/approach A survey using FluidSurveys was distributed via e-mail to authors of poster and papers presentation presented at Canadian Health Libraries Association/Association des bibliothèques de la santé du Canada conferences from 2004 to 2009. A literature search for articles matching presentations in National Library of Medicine's PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Library, Information Science &amp; Technology Abstracts was conducted to determine publication rate. Metrics of retrieved articles were gathered and analyzed to gage scholarly output of Canadian health sciences librarians. Findings A publication rate of 31.5 percent was determined by literature search. Time restriction was the most common reported reason for not publishing. The altmetric analysis included 71 articles, of which 52 percent had at least one value in various metrics, with Mendeley counts being the most common value represented.

In an information market where technology has increased access to content, thereby providing resources at one's fingertips, the provision of services is increasingly becoming a distinctive signifier of excellence and quality. In such an open/service-oriented marketplace, what are the services that are signifiers of excellence and consequently distinguish a library? This paper aims to review select literature within the USA to identify the services that are signifiers of excellence and that will consequently distinguish a library in the current era and investigate the extent to which said services identified in the review of the literature are provided by the University of the West Indies (UWI) Mona library, but focus specifically on only those that meet the additional criteria of placing the UWI Mona library as either the first to introduce the service in Jamaica or as the only library in Jamaica with the particular service offering. These two additional criteria provide the added signature or uniqueness essential to being distinguished. Design/methodology/approach Through the use of a mixed methods research, this paper highlights library service offerings considered as distinctive signifiers of excellence within the American literature and also within the UWI Mona Library - that will distinguish a library. Findings This paper reveals services incorporating technology, the library as a place/space, teaching and research and personal attention to users as distinctive signifiers of excellence. In this regard, within the UWI Mona Library, services offered such as the Virtual Reference Service, Extended Opening Service, Halls of Residence Librarian Service, Information Commons Service, Information Literacy Service and the West Indies and Special Collection Research Service were found to incorporate the aforementioned service themes and placed the UWI Mona library as either the first to introduce the service in Jamaica or as the only library in Jamaica with the particular service offering, consequently distinguishing the UWI Mona Library from other academic libraries in Jamaica. Originality/value This paper is of value, as it provides the library and information community with an outline of services that distinguish a library; it offers library managers in Jamaica and the rest of the world the opportunity to compare services in their libraries with that of other libraries as outlined within the literature review as well as within the UWI Mona library; it highlights how the UWI Mona library, an academic library in the Caribbean, compares on the international library scene, with particular reference to the USA; it informs current and potential library users of how the UWI Mona library is trending in service culture and a focus on distinctive services can promote a community of academic library service best practice.","academic libraries , college campuses , university colleges , learning commons , literature reviews , united states--us , jamaica",sasekea harris,distinctive services in academic librarianship,new library world

This article assesses whether one such altmetric, Mendeley readership counts, correlates strongly with citation counts across all medical fields, whether the relationship is stronger if student readers are excluded, and whether they are distributed similarly to citation counts. Based on a sample of 332,975 articles from 2009 in 45 medical fields in Scopus, citation counts correlated strongly (about 0.7; 78% of articles had at least one reader) with Mendeley readership counts (from the new version 1 applications programming interface [API]) in almost all fields, with one minor exception, and the correlations tended to decrease slightly when student readers were excluded. Readership followed either a lognormal or a hooked power law distribution, whereas citations always followed a hooked power law, showing that the two may have underlying differences.","studies , readership , medical research , benchmarks , scholarly publishing , citation analysis , medical research , readers , power law , correlation , electric power distribution , law , audience , reading","mike thelwall, paul wilson",mendeley readership altmetrics for medical articles an analysis of 45 fields,journal of the association for information science and technology

Design/methodology/approach A close review of the literature provides a comprehensive list of web robot detection techniques. Reviews of system documentation and open source code are carried out along with personal interviews to provide a comparison of the robot detection techniques used in the major IR platforms. An empirical test based on a simple random sample of downloads with 96.20 per cent certainty is undertaken to measure the accuracy of an IR's web robot detection at a large Irish University. Findings While web robot detection is not ignored in IRs, there are areas where the two main systems could be improved. The technique tested here is found to have successfully detected 94.18 per cent of web robots visiting the site over a two-year period (recall), with a precision of 98.92 per cent. Due to the high level of robot activity in repositories, correctly labelling more robots has an exponential effect on the accuracy of usage statistics. Research limitations/implications This study is performed on one repository using a single system.

Therefore, new forms of research evaluation are emerging as alternative to the traditional citation-based metrics. Initially based on web links or download numbers (webometrics) the new evaluation methods have evolved into alternative metrics, or &quot;altmetrics&quot;, based on the set of activities covered by social media services. In view of the above, the paper concentrates on academic blogging as a form of scholarly communication in the Open Science context, and on the disciplinary areas of the Humanities and Social Science as privileged domain to be investigated.

Without this information, it is not possible to give a confident interpretation of altmetrics derived from Mendeley. In response, a survey of 860 Mendeley users shows that it is reasonable to use Mendeley bookmarking counts as an indication of readership because most (55%) users with a Mendeley library had read or intended to read at least half of their bookmarked publications. This was true across all broad areas of scholarship except for the arts and humanities (42%). About 85% of the respondents also declared that they bookmarked articles in Mendeley to cite them in their publications, but some also bookmark articles for use in professional (50%), teaching (25%), and educational activities (13%). Of course, it is likely that most readers do not record articles in Mendeley and so these data do not represent all readers. In conclusion, Mendeley bookmark counts seem to be indicators of readership leading to a combination of scholarly impact and wider professional impact.","user behavior , studies , readership , correlation analysis , electronic publishing , libraries , citation analysis , readers , scientific papers , documents , polls & surveys , educational activities , audience , respondents","ehsan mohammadi, mike thelwall, kayvan kousha",can mendeley bookmarks reflect readership a survey of user motivations,journal of the association for information science and technology

To identify whether citations from guidelines can give different information from that of traditional citation counts, this article assesses the extent to which references in clinical guidelines tend to be highly cited in the academic literature and highly read in Mendeley. Using evidence from the United Kingdom, references associated with the UK's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines tended to be substantially more cited than comparable articles, unless they had been published in the most recent 3 years. Citation counts also seemed to be stronger indicators than Mendeley readership altmetrics. Hence, although presence in guidelines may be particularly useful to highlight the contributions of recently published articles, for older articles citation counts may already be sufficient to recognize their contributions to health in society.","studies , informetrics , medical research , citation analysis , readership , articles , guidelines , medical personnel , health , medical research , audience , united kingdom--uk","mike thelwall, nabeil maflahi",guideline references and academic citations as evidence of the clinical value of health research,journal of the association for information science and technology

A range of platforms, such as academic social networking sites (SNS), are geared specifically towards the academic community. Proponents of the altmetrics approach have pointed out that new media allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment. Traditional impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been criticized for overlooking the relational dynamics of scientific impact. We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to researchers' interactions on an academic social networking site to generate potential new metrics of scientific impact. Based on a case study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars, we analyze how centrality measures derived from the participants' interactions on the academic SNS ResearchGate relate to traditional, offline impact indicators. We find that platform engagement, seniority, and publication impact contribute to members' indegree and eigenvector centrality on the platform, but less so to closeness or betweenness centrality. We conclude that a relational approach based on social network analyses of academic SNS, while subject to platform-specific dynamics, may add richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment.","studies , impact analysis , social network analysis , scholarly publishing , social networks , researchers , social networks , network analysis , digital media , eigenvectors , academic discourse","christian pieter hoffmann, christoph lutz, miriam meckel",a relational altmetric network centrality on researchgate as an indicator of scientific impact,journal of the association for information science and technology

Faculty and students have new and different expectations that are compelling libraries to expand their offerings. At the same time, their broader institutions are also facing changing times and academic libraries are being asked to demonstrate value and justify the use of limited and high-demand resources. In order to address the resulting challenge, the University of Saskatchewan (U of S) Library undertook a process to deliver relevant and responsive (and, therefore, reflective and adaptable) library services while working within its current librarian complement. Significant changes were necessary for this to be successful: the librarians would need to undertake new responsibilities, learn new skills, and engage with learners and researchers in new ways. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The U of S Library chose to meet this challenge through a multi-part approach comprised of regular participative consultations with librarians and a grassroots-based planning process underpinned by change management methodology. Findings - This approach resulted in widespread employee engagement, from initially clarifying the necessary change and throughout the change implementation. This led to a sense of ownership, responsibility, and accountability. Originality/value - Change is difficult and often met with resistance. The U of S Library presents a case of successfully engaging library employees throughout a change process, demonstrating the importance of bringing together participative consultation, grassroots planning, and change management as a combined change implementation approach.","academic libraries , librarians , higher education , research , teaching , learning , planning , international finance , student retention , trends , college campuses , collaboration , leadership , researchers , scholarly communication , user services , canada","charlene sorensen, rachel sarjeant-jenkins",sustainable growth with sustainable resources,library management

Mendeley readership count is one such indicator. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the paper aims to investigate the relationship between citation counts and Mendeley readership counts. The paper also evaluates the relationship between Mendeley readership metrics for two different time periods, thereby investigating its nature as an altmetric indicator. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using the Scopus database. Top 100 papers in Physics published during 2005 as well as in 2010 that received the largest number of citations were selected. Mendeley readership data were collected using Mendeley readership statistics for documents indexed in Scopus. For establishing a relationship between citation counts and Mendeley readership, correlation was calculated between the citations in Scopus database and Mendeley readership. The difference in Mendeley readership for different time periods was also investigated. Findings - The paper showed that for both the years, Mendeley readership counts were in positive correlation with citation counts. For the year 2010, it was found that Mendeley readership counts were in strong positive correlation with citation counts, whereas for 2005, they were in moderate positive correlation. Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of this paper is that with time more scientists and researchers may join Mendeley causing various changes in data and giving different results. Also, the paper has focused on the highly cited papers in Physics. Originality/value - Very few studies have been conducted in the area of altmetrics, as it is a comparatively new and emerging field of research. The findings of this paper offer insights to the question whether Mendeley readership counts can be used as an alternative to traditional sources of bibliometric indicators like citations, h-index, etc. The paper also evaluates the difference in the nature of traditional bibliometric indicators and Mendeley readership counts.","studies , social networks , web sites , citation indexes , india","rishabh shrivastava, preeti mahajan",relationship between citation counts and mendeley readership metrics,new library world

The set of tools known as altmetrics have had an impact on journal article evaluation in particular. Altmetrics, a blend of the words alternative and metrics, show the use of an article beyond citation counts, which are a method traditionally used to evaluate the impact of an article. This usage can include appearances on Wikipedia, discussion in social media outlets, saves in book-marking programs like Mendeley or Delicious, blog posts and Web sites that reference the article, and many more. While citation counts have traditionally been viewed as the purest measure of scholarly usage of an article, altmetrics present a more comprehensive view of how the article is used in less formal ways and in less academic outlets.","informetrics , scholarly communication","lauren b phd collister, timothy s msis dellyannides",altmerics documenting the story of research,against the grain

On Twitter, the #icanhazpdf hashtag has emerged as a way for researchers to request and obtain journal articles quickly and efficiently. This study analyzes use of the #icanhazpdf hashtag as a means of obtaining health sciences literature. Methods: RowFeeder software was used to monitor and aggregate #icanhazpdf requests between 1 February and 30 April 2015. This software records data such as Twitter handle, tweet content, tweeter location, date, and time. Tweets were hand-coded for the journal subject area, the requestor’s geographic location, and the requestor’s occupational sector. Results: There were 302 requests for health sciences literature during the study period. Many requests were made by users affiliated with a post-secondary academic institution (45%, n = 136). Very few requests were made by users located in Canada ( n = 15). Conclusion: #icanhazpdf requests for health sciences literature account for a relatively small proportion of peer-to-peer article sharing activities when compared with other online platforms. Nevertheless, this study provides evidence that some faculty and students are choosing social media over the library as a means of obtaining health sciences literature. Examining peer-to-peer article sharing practices can provide insights into patron behaviour and expectations.","research , digital object identifier , web sites , journals , books , immunology , social networks , copyright , librarians , researchers , licensing , licenses , library resources , health sciences , access to materials , ireland , united states--us , canada , united kingdom--uk","michelle swab, kristen romme",scholarly sharing via twitter icanhazpdf requests for health sciences literature,the journal of the canadian health libraries association journal de lassociation des bibliotheques de la sante du canada

Findings – Some alternative indicators have advantages to usefully complement scientometric data by reflecting a different type of impact or through being available before citation data. Research limitations/implications – The empirical part of the results is based on a single case study and does not give statistical evidence for the added value of any of the indicators. Practical implications – A few selected alternative indicators can be used by funding agencies as part of their funding scheme evaluations if they are processed in ways that enable comparisons between data sets. Their evidence value is only weak, however. Originality/value – This is the first analysis of altmetrics or webometrics from a funding scheme evaluation perspective.","added value, bibliometrics, business metrics, confidence intervals, empirical analysis, funding, funding, independent sample, indicators, informetrics, library science, performance evaluation, research, researchers, studies, webometrics","mike thelwall, kayvan kousha, adam dinsmore, kevin dolby",alternative metric indicators for funding scheme evaluations,aslib journal of information management

Data on Twitter mentions were extracted from PlumX Analytics, information on each Twitter user was taken from the own platform and citations were collected from Scopus public API. Results show that papers from Twitter users are 33&#xa0;% more tweeted than documents of non-Twitter users. From Twitter users, the increase of followers produces 30&#xa0;% more tweets. No differences were found between the citation impact (i.e. number of citations) of papers authored by Twitter users and non-Twitter users. However, the number of followers indirectly influences the citation impact. The main conclusion is that the participation on Twitter affects the dissemination of research papers, and in consequence, it indirectly favours the likelihood that academic outputs being cited.","social networks , citation analysis , data processing , followers , analytics , scientific papers",jose luis ortega,to be or not to be on twitter and its relationship with the tweeting and citation of research papers,scientometrics

In the last few years, the interest in altmetrics has grown, giving rise to many questions regarding their potential benefits and challenges. This paper aims to address some of these questions. First, we provide an overview of the altmetrics landscape, comparing tool features, social media data sources, and social media events provided by altmetric aggregators. Second, we conduct a systematic review of the altmetrics literature. A total of 172 articles were analysed, revealing a steady rise in altmetrics research since 2011. Third, we analyse the results of over 80 studies from the altmetrics literature on two major research topics: cross-metric validation and coverage of altmetrics. An aggregated percentage coverage across studies on 11 data sources shows that Mendeley has the highest coverage of about 59&#xa0;% across 15 studies. A meta-analysis across more than 40 cross-metric validation studies shows overall a weak correlation (ranging from 0.08 to 0.5) between altmetrics and citation counts, confirming that altmetrics do indeed measure a different kind of research impact, thus acting as a complement rather than a substitute to traditional metrics. Finally, we highlight open challenges and issues facing altmetrics and discuss future research areas.","social networks , social networks , informetrics , media , reviews , data sources , digital media , correlation analysis , literature reviews","mojisola erdt, aarthy nagarajan, joanna sin sei-ching, yin-leng theng",altmetrics an analysis of the state of the art in measuring research impact on social media,scientometrics

The results from four high profile general medical journals support the hypothesis, although there may not be a cause-and effect relationship. Nevertheless, it is reasonable for researchers to use citations to their work from clinical trials records as evidence of the possible long-term impact of their research.","research , clinical trials , clinical trials , impact analysis , journals , warning , medical research , medical research , hypotheses","mike thelwall, kayvan kousha",are citations from clinical trials evidence of higher impact research an analysis of clinicaltrials gov,scientometrics

The sample size was determined to be 1892 articles using the Cochrane formula and data were gathered by using the PLOS altmetrics. The study’s model fit indices showed that visibility influences citation both directly and indirectly through the mediating role of save. Discussion had a significant, negative role in the relationship between visibility and citation, and recommendation did not have any significant mediating role in this relationship. Among the social networks presenting altmetrics, it seems that networks such as Mendeley which provide a basis for saving scientific articles have an important and significant effect on the amount of future citations through visibility metrics. This is while social networks discussing scientific findings have a negative effect on the future citation of articles through visibility metrics. This asserts that social networks based on save have an influential role as the basis of scientific interaction.","visibility , social networks , visibility , citation analysis , citation analysis , social organization , correlation analysis , social networks , informetrics , social interactions , sampling methods , scientific papers , correlation analysis","saeideh ebrahimy, jafar mehrad, fatemeh setareh, massoud hosseinchari",path analysis of the relationship between visibility and citation the mediating roles of save discussion and recommendation metrics,scientometrics

We further reveal that papers published in Nature and Science as well as from the areas “Earth and related environmental sciences” and “Social and economic geography” are especially relevant in the policy context. Given the low coverage of the climate change literature in policy documents, this study can be only a first attempt to study this new source of altmetrics data.

Methods - Institutions located in the Long Island region and within Nassau and Suffolk counties, including the State University of New York (SUNY) colleges, private institutions, and technical schools, were examined for the last 14 years (2000-2013). Eight Long Island institutions were represented in both databases and were included in the study. Results - Of the eight institutions, Stony Brook University produced the most publications indexed in Web of Science and Scopus during the period of 2000-2013. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory yielded the second most publications during 2000-2013 in both Web of Science and Scopus, but it produced the highest quality publications compared with other institutions excluding Stony Brook University. Although the annual growth rates of Farmingdale State College and New York Institute of Technology increased dramatically in both Web of Science and Scopus, the large proportional increase did not represent a large increase in total value. Additionally, some institutions had a higher number of publications indexed in Web of Science than in Scopus, and others had a higher number of publications indexed in Scopus than in Web of Science. Conclusions - Data were collected from institutions in Long Island with various institutional sizes, the number of faculty members employed may have made an impact on the number of publications. Thus, publication data in this study cannot be used to compare their rankings. Institutions with a similar type and similar size of faculty members should be selected for comparison. Due to the different coverage and scope of Web of Science and Scopus, institutions should use both databases to examine their scholarly output. Furthermore, institutions should consider using altmetrics to capture various impacts of the scholarly output to complement the traditional metrics.","publication output , productivity , scholarly communication","clara tran, selenay aytac",measuring scholarly productivity of long island educational institutions using web of science and scopus as a tool,evidence based library and information practice

Design - Online survey. Setting - A consortium of 12 large universities in Spain. Subjects - More than 17,380 faculty members. Methods - The researchers used a questionnaire based on a subset of the questionnaire used for the Ithaka S+R Faculty Survey, with 20 closed and 2 open-ended questions. The survey was implemented via Google Forms and sent through mailing lists. The number of recipients was not known, but university statistics for 11 of the 12 universities list 17,380 faculty (statistics were not available for one university, located in a different administrative area). The questions aimed to identify the types of documents used by scholars for teaching and research, the search tools used, the strategies used to keep up-to-date in their disciplines, preferences for print or electronic books, the sources used to access documents, their preferred channels to disseminate their own research, and their views regarding library services. Main Results - The response rate was 12.7%. Based on the results, scholarly journals were the most used information resource for research across all academic disciplines, with 94% of respondents rating them as important. For teaching, faculty preferred to use textbooks for undergraduates, and journal articles for Master's students. To search the literature, faculty chose bibliographic databases and Internet search engines over the library catalog and physical collections, although the catalog was the first choice for known-item searches. Respondents favored print to read entire books or chapters but preferred the electronic format for skimming. Of the respondents, 78% rated the library as an important channel to access resources, while 61% also considered free online materials important. If the material was not available at their library, 71% frequently chose to search for a free online version and 42% used the inter-library loan service. For their own research, faculty have published in scholarly journals more often than other channels and have selected the journal based on its impact factor (77.5% ranked it as important) and on its area of coverage (73.4%). When asked to rank library services, faculty placed paying for resources highest, with 86.2% identifying it as important. Next were facilitating teaching and helping students develop information literacy skills. Finally, a majority of faculty considered themselves highly dependent on the library. Conclusion - Journal articles are the most widely used information resource for research and teaching purposes, regardless of discipline. This includes arts and humanities, which are known for heavy monograph usage. Articles are also scholars' preferred channel for publishing. With regards to books, faculty have mixed feelings about print and electronic formats. Spanish faculty display information behaviours similar to their British and American counterparts, as documented in the Ithaka S+R 2012 surveys. Blogs and social networks are not widely used in spite of growing attention to such channels for research output and altmetrics. Open access is also relatively unimportant for faculty when they choose where to publish. A majority of respondents still consider library services as important, for collections as well as teaching and learning support, which may present opportunities for librarians.","scholarly communication , user services , information literacy , library catalogs , academic libraries , bibliographic data bases , information sources , information seeking behavior , college faculty , library resources , spain",dominique daniel,faculty still rely on library resources and services for their research,evidence based library and information practice

Participants were queried about use, issues, and attitudes toward scholarly profile and altmetric tools, as well as the role librarians could play in assisting with the curation of online reputation. Methods - Semi-structured interviews with 18 scholar-practitioners and 5 graduate students from two mid-sized universities. Results - While all participants had Googled themselves, few were strategic about their online scholarly identity. Participants affirmed the perception that altmetrics can be of value in helping to craft a story of the value of their research and its diverse outputs. When participants had prior knowledge of altmetrics tools, it tended to be very narrow and deep, and perhaps field-specific. Participants identified time as the major barrier to use of scholarly profile and altmetrics tools. Conclusions - Librarians are well-placed to assist scholar-practitioners who wish to curate an online profile or use altmetrics tools. Areas of assistance include: personalized support, establishment of goals, orientation to specific tools, orientation to altmetrics and scholarly promotion landscape, preparing users for potential difficulties, discussing copyright implications, Open Access education, and guidance with packaging content for different venues and audiences.","informetrics , scholars , librarians","kathleen reed, dana mcfarland, rosie croft",laying the groundwork for a new library service scholar practitioner amp amp graduate student attitudes toward altmetrics and the curation of online profiles,evidence based library and information practice

Design - A pre- and post-intervention survey questionnaire. Setting - A large university in Canada. Subjects - A cohort of 160 second year undergraduate medical students enrolled in the three-year programme of a large university in Canada. Methods - As part of the redevelopment of the undergraduate three-year medical course, information literacy skills in evidence based medicine were integrated into the seminar and small group teaching programme. Every week for five weeks, 3 librarians each visited 4 small groups of 15 students to deliver a 15-minute session as part of a 2-hour long seminar led by practising physicians. The sessions did not include a formal hands-on component, however, students were encouraged to try out searches on their own devices. Each 15-minute session covered 3 learning objectives, including how to use PubMed clinical queries, how to use MeSH, and how to search for systematic reviews and guidelines. A pre- and post-intervention survey design was used to assess students' perceptions of the impact of these sessions. The students were asked to complete an online Survey Monkey survey before and after the five week lecture block. The questions covered resource selection, perception of barriers to finding evidence based information, and the students' confidence in using evidence based resources. The data were analysed descriptively. Main results - The pre-survey achieved a 90% (144/160) response rate while the post-survey achieved a 75% (112/160) response rate. The post-survey indicated an increase in the likelihood that students would use Ovid MEDLINE, carry out a literature search, and consult a librarian, with a decrease in those who would consult a print or online textbook. There was limited change in the students' confidence that they could find answers quickly, but more of an increase in the proportion of students who were confident they could find systematic reviews and guidelines, and use search limits, PICO, and MeSH. Before the intervention, ""knowing where to search,"" devising a search strategy, and retrieving too many results were all thought to be obstacles by the students. After the small group training, students considered these issues less of a problem. The post-survey also included an opportunity for the students to comment on their experience with the programme overall. Of the 54 responses received, 34 identified the library component as being the most important thing they had learned in the small group part of the course. Conclusion - The authors conclude that integrating information literacy into the undergraduate curriculum as part of the small group seminar series is effective. They suggest future directions for research, such as a study to assess the impact of the training on specific skills rather than student confidence and evaluations of other teaching methods.","seminars , information literacy , librarians , college students , curricula , canada",virginia wilson,research methods altmetrics,evidence based library and information practice

354,Thomson Reuters utiliza altmétricas: usage counts para los artículos indizados en la Web of Science/Thomson Reuters uses altmetrics: usage counts for articles indexed in the Web of Science,Scholarly Journals,"emilio delgado-lopez-cozar, alberto martin-martin",,Journal Article,0,Spanish,2016,10, Bibliometrics,,Anuario ThinkEPI,,"Since September 2015, Web of Science has displayed an indicator of a non-bibliometric nature. The new indicator, called ""usage count"", measures the number of times the full text of a document has been accessed, and the number of times the bibliographic reference of the document has been exported to a reference manager. The same indicator is computed for two different time frames: one is a rolling window that measures the number of times the document has been accessed in the last 180 days and the other measures all instances of access since 2013. In order to decipher the meaning of this new indicator, apart from reflecting on the actions we expect to measure, an exploratory study was conducted where the new indicators were compared to the traditional citation counts, by pulling two samples of documents: the most cited documents published in 2015 (so far), and the most used ones. The greatest difference found between the two samples indicates the two indicators reflect different types of impact. After all, citations and usage of documents are actions so different in nature that their counts can only offer divergent results. Moreover, a very low correlation was found between these usage counts and the most common altmetrics.

In this article we explore how Semantometrics can help to characterise the types of research collaboration in scholarly publication networks and the nature of the cross-community ties, and how this information can be utilised in aiding research evaluation. In contrast to the existing research evaluation metrics such as Bibliometrics, Altmetrics or Webometrics, which are based on measuring the number of interactions in the scholarly network, Semantometrics build on the premise that fulltext is needed to understand the value of publications. Using the CORE dataset as a case study, this paper looks at the relation between the semantic distance of authors and their research endogamy value. We identify four potential types of collaboration in a coauthorship network. The results suggest similar measures can be used to provide meaningful information about the nature of collaboration in scholarly publication networks.","case studies , bibliometrics , collaboration , academic publications , co authorship , webometrics","drahomira herrmannova, petr knoth",semantometrics in coauthorship networks fulltext based approach for analysing patterns of research collaboration,d lib magazine

Design/methodology/approach - The research reviews the literature and current practices within higher education with regard to the core purposes of institutional repositories, the possible causes of low population of repositories in some institutions and subject disciplines, how this is being addressed and likely future developments. A qualitative survey using semi-structured interviews explores current best practices and tests the specific research questions that emerged from the literature review. Findings - The rate at which institutional repositories have grown in number has been very fast in recent years, but the population of repositories with research has been relatively slow. The research identified a number of reasons as to why the population of repositories was likely to accelerate in the future and have a more significant impact on scholarly communication. The main catalysts are: strengthening of national and funder policies that serve to both mandate open access (green or gold) and raise awareness of open access amongst faculty; the alignment of repositories with current research information systems within universities; and the development of metadata and open archives initiative harvesting that will improve discoverability and usage data. Research limitations/implications - As many of the issues around the development of repositories centre on the attitudes of faculty, it would also provide an interesting extension to the research to understand their views of the role of institutional repositories, too. Practical implications - The study presents a number of possible new ways of working by both information professionals and publishers to improve scholarly communication through the inclusion of research within institutional repositories and how perceived barriers could be overcome. Social implications - The study provides guidance on how the communication of scholarly research could be improved and reach a wider audience. This, in turn, will benefit researchers, corporate organisations and the public at large.

Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends on the unit of assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance, publication counts are useful tools to help discriminate between those staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared with one another according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics, including altmetrics, applied at the level of individual articles, individual researchers, research groups, and institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension. It introduces the concept of a ""meta-analysis"" of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process.","matrix , decision analysis , performance evaluation , studies , meta-analysis , research & development--r&d , meta analyses","henk f moed, gali halevi",multidimensional assessment of scholarly research impact,journal of the association for information science and technology

Publications from the social sciences, humanities, and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but is relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same kind of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly-cited publications than journal citation scores. Altmetric scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are able to identify highly-cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation.","correlation analysis , citation analysis , studies , comparative analysis , social networks , performance evaluation , publications , indicators , citation analysis , scientific papers , documents , digital media , blogs , social sciences","rodrigo costas, zohreh zahedi, paul wouters",do altmetrics correlate with citations extensive comparison of altmetric indicators with citations from a multidisciplinary perspective,journal of the association for information science and technology

First, the study aims to investigate the relationship between the altmetric indicators from ResearchGate (RG) and the bibliometric indicators from the Scopus database. Second, the study seeks to examine the relationship amongst the RG altmetric indicators themselves. RG is a rich source of altmetric indicators such as Citations, RGScore, Impact Points, Profile Views, Publication Views, etc. Design/methodology/approach - For establishing whether RG metrics showed the same results as the established sources of metrics, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated between the metrics provided by RG and the metrics obtained from Scopus. Pearson's correlation coefficients were also calculated for the metrics provided by RG. The data were collected by visiting the profile pages of all the members who had an account in RG under the Department of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh (India). Findings - The study showed that most of the RG metrics showed strong positive correlation with the Scopus metrics, except for RGScore (RG) and Citations (Scopus), which showed moderate positive correlation. It was also found that the RG metrics showed moderate to strong positive correlation amongst each other. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is that more and more scientists and researchers may join RG in the future, therefore the data may change. The study focuses on the members who had an account in RG under the Department of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh (India). Perhaps further studies can be conducted by increasing the sample size and by taking a different sample size having different characteristics. Originality/value - Being an emerging field, not much has been conducted in the area of altmetrics. Very few studies have been conducted on the reach of academic social networks like RG and their validity as sources of altmetric indicators like RGScore, Impact Points, etc. The findings offer insights to the question whether RG can be used as an alternative to traditional sources of bibliometric indicators, especially with reference to a rapidly developing country such as India.","bibliometrics, citations, hirsch index, india, informetrics, journals, libraries, library and information science, publications, researchers, scholars, science, social networks, social research, studies, webometrics","rishabh shrivastava, preeti mahajan",relationship amongst researchgate altmetric indicators and scopus bibliometric indicators,new library world

The majority of readers for all disciplines were PhD students, postgraduates, and postdocs but other types of academics were also represented. In addition, many Clinical Medicine articles were read by medical professionals. The highest correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts were found for types of users who often authored academic articles, except for associate professors in some sub-disciplines. This suggests that Mendeley readership can reflect usage similar to traditional citation impact if the data are restricted to readers who are also authors without the delay of impact measured by citation counts. At the same time, Mendeley statistics can also reveal the hidden impact of some research articles, such as educational value for nonauthor users inside academia or the impact of research articles on practice for readers outside academia.","studies , clinical medicine , correlation analysis , citation analysis , readership , articles , citation analysis , organic chemistry , readers , clinical medicine , audience , medicine , medical personnel","ehsan mohammadi, mike thelwall, stefanie haustein, vincent lariviere",who reads research articles an altmetrics analysis of mendeley user categories,journal of the association for information science and technology

The concept of library involvement pertaining to metrics did not originate with altmetrics. Impact Factor was originally created primarily for use by librarians in making collection development and retention decisions. Libraries continue to bear primary responsibility for the acquisition of bibliometrics tools, most notably Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports, and Scopus, as well as the training of people in their use. As a result, librarians are already familiar with providing support for these tools, so it makes sense that librarians have expanded to support the variety of altmetrics sources and tools. Additionally, librarians serve as natural leaders when it comes to altmetrics, not only due to familiarity with resources, but also because of the relationships they maintain with several disparate groups.

The main value of information is in its ability to be used, reused, and shared. Open access (OA) allows for the easy dissemination and preservation of information by providing all scholarly communication and knowledge at no cost to the end user. In the rapidly expanding, global knowledge-based economy, Africa's steady progress from the peripheral to the epicenter of knowledge production is not to be ignored, not least because of its reliance on OA. Such access environments and institutional repositories throughout the continent are playing significant roles in maximizing the impact of research output. This paper reveals that OA content is more citable, not simply because of the quality of the output, but instead of the advantage that OA brings in maximizing accessibility and increased citation. It goes on to show that OA will enhance the research community's existing system for evaluating and rewarding research productivity. Ultimately, OA has the ability to elevate (South) Africa, its universities and institutions, to the status of knowledge producers rather than mere knowledge consumers.","open source software , education , libraries , science , studies , publishing , brain research , principles , journals , public good , access to information , institutional repositories , scholarly communication , knowledge , playing , academic discourse , africa","reggie raju, amina adam, crystal powell",promoting open scholarship in africa benefits and best library practices,library trends

Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a case study of China and empirical data collected through semi-structured interviews with a wide range of academics and stakeholders. Findings - A separation between the communication and certification functions of publishing is identified: open initiatives are valued for efficient and interactive communication while traditional publishing still dominates the legitimacy of research publications, which leads to the quandary of individual academics operating within the transitional landscape of scholarly communication. Practical implications - Practical recommendations for sustainable and efficient openness are derived from discussions on the difficulties associated open/social certification and the shifting maxims that govern academics from ""publish or perish"" to ""be visible or vanish"". Originality/value - ""Openness"" is defined in broad sense integrating Open Access and open scholarship to comprehensively reflect individual academics' views in the transitional landscape of academic publishing. The research findings suggest that new open approaches are needed to address the evolving tension and conflicts between communication and certification.","social networks , certification , education , scholarly publishing , science , social research , studies , publishing industry , participation , corruption , funding , scholars , quality , open access publishing , peer review , authorship , scholarly communication , web 2.0 , china",xiang ren,the quandary between communication and certification individual academics views on open access and open scholarship,online information review

Design/methodology/approach - Extent of visibility is explored by quantitative analysis of institutional repository and OA journals data sets followed by qualitative analysis of OA foundation documents and literature on OA in Africa published mainly between 2003 and 2013. Findings - Visibility in institutional repositories or OA journals for African researchers remains low. Causes include insufficient educational support for librarians and administrators in required new roles; inability of national, organisational and technological infrastructures to support OA; impracticality of western-based and costly publishing models; and disincentives relating to intellectual property and researcher perceptions. Complex language and literacy issues also inhibit engagement. Recommendations include strong OA advocacy, development of support initiatives, integration of international knowledge for local conditions and vice versa, sensitive preservation of indigenous knowledge and development of mechanisms of funding and research assessment mechanisms, which are economically and technically viable. Originality/value - Earlier attempts were made to raise awareness about the lack of uptake of OA in Africa. This paper shows that the situation has hardly changed and now requires urgent attention. Otherwise OA will not ""become the default method for distributing new peer-reviewed research in every field and country"" by 2022 (BOAI, 2012).","research , libraries , librarians , scholarly publishing , society , publishing industry , distance learning , funding , web portals , researchers , initiatives , open access publishing , journals , institutional repositories , webometrics , africa","moya fox, susannah micaela hanlon",barriers to open access uptake for researchers in africa,online information review

It identifies and discusses recent trends and future challenges for various stakeholders in delivering Open Access (OA) to the scholarly literature. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a number of interrelated strands of evidence which make up the current discourse on OA, comprising the peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and other forms of communication (including blogs and e-mail discussion lists). It uses a large-scale textual analysis of the peer-reviewed literature since 2010 (carried out using the VOSviewer tool) as a basis for discussion of issues raised in the OA discourse. Findings - A number of key themes are identified, including the relationship between ""Green"" OA (deposit in repositories) and ""Gold"" OA (OA journal publication), the developing evidence base associated with OA, researcher attitudes and behaviours, policy directions, management of repositories, development of journals, institutional responses and issues around impact and scholarly communication futures. It suggests that current challenges now focus on how OA can be made to work in practice, having moved on from the discussion of whether it should happen at all.

In total, 6,132 profiles were classified according the eight research areas of the CSIC. Findings - Results show that Academia.edu is massively populated by humanists and social scientists, while RG is popular among biologists. Disciplinary differences are observed across every platform. Thus, scientists from the humanities and social sciences and natural resources show a significant activity contacting other members. On the contrary, biologists are more passive using social tools.

Design/methodology/approach – The high-dimensional visualisation approach was applied to three science topics to test its effectiveness for longitudinal analysis of message framing on Twitter over two disjoint periods in time. The paper uses coding frames to drive categorisation and visual analytics of tweets discussing the science topics. Findings – The findings point to the potential of this mixed methods approach, as it allows sufficiently high sensitivity to recognise and support the analysis of non-trending as well as trending topics on Twitter. Research limitations/implications – Three topics are studied, these illustrate a range of frames, but results may not be representative of all science topics. Social implications – Funding bodies increasingly encourage scientists to participate in public engagement. As social media provides an avenue actively utilised for public communication, understanding the nature of the dialog on this medium is important for the scientific community and the public at large.

Design/methodology/approach – This study uses article metadata from a prominent Latin American journal portal, SciELO, and combines it with altmetrics data from Altmetric.com and with data collected by author-written scripts. The study is primarily descriptive, focusing on coverage levels disaggregated by year, country, subject area, and language. Findings – Coverage levels for most of the social media sources studied was zero or negligible. Only three metrics had coverage levels above 2 per cent – Mendeley, Twitter, and Facebook. Of these, Twitter showed the most significant differences with previous studies. Mendeley coverage levels reach those found by previous studies, but it takes up to two years longer for articles to be saved in the reference manager. For the most recent year, coverage was less than half than what was found in previous studies. The coverage levels of Facebook appear similar (around 3 per cent) to that of previous studies. Research limitations/implications – The Altmetric.com data used for some of the analyses were collected for a six month period. For other analyses, Altmetric.com data were only available for a single country (Brazil). Originality/value – The results of this study have implications for the altmetrics research community and for any stakeholders interested in using altmetrics for evaluation.

Design/methodology/approach – Book titles were extracted from the reference lists of articles that appeared in 604 history journals indexed in Scopus (2007-2011). The titles were cleaned and matched with WorldCat.org (for publisher information) as well as Goodreads (for reader ratings) using an API. A set of 8,538 books was first filtered based on Dewey Decimal Classification class 900 “History and Geography”, then a subset of 997 books with the highest citations and reader ratings (i.e. top 25 per cent) was analysed separately based on additional characteristics. Findings – A weak correlation (0.212) was found between citation counts and reader rating counts for the full data set ( n =8,538). An additional correlation for the subset of 997 books indicated a similar weak correlation (0.190). Further correlations between citations, reader ratings, written reviews, and library holdings indicate that a reader rating on Goodreads was more likely to be given to a book held in an international library, including both public and academic libraries. Originality/value – Research on altmetrics has focused almost exclusively on scientific journal articles appearing on social media services (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). In this paper we show the potential of Goodreads reader ratings to identify the impact of books beyond academia. As a unique altmetric data source, Goodreads can allow scholarly authors from the social sciences and humanities to measure the wider impact of their books.","social networks , scholars , ratings , studies , books , digital media , books , geography , united states--us","alesia a zuccala, frederik t verleysen, roberto cornacchia, tim ce engels",altmetrics for the humanities,aslib journal of information management

Design/methodology/approach – Social media metrics and readership counts, associated with 500,216 publications and their citation data from the Web of Science database, were collected from Altmetric.com and Mendeley. Results are presented through descriptive statistical analyses together with science maps generated with VOSviewer. Findings – The results confirm Mendeley as the most prevalent social media source with similar characteristics to citations in their distribution across fields and their density in average values per publication. The humanities, natural sciences, and engineering disciplines have a much lower presence of social media metrics. Twitter has a stronger focus on general medicine and social sciences. Other sources (blog, Facebook, Google+, and news media mentions) are more prominent in regards to multidisciplinary journals. Originality/value – This paper reinforces the relevance of Mendeley as a social media source for analytical purposes from a disciplinary perspective, being particularly relevant for the social sciences (together with Twitter).

Design/methodology/approach – This case study is based on a sample of 1,082 the Public Library of Science (PLOS) journal articles recommended in F1000. The data set includes altmetrics which were provided by PLOS. The F1000 data set contains tags on papers which were assigned by experts to characterise them. Findings – The most relevant tag for altmetric research is “good for teaching”, as it is assigned to papers which could be of interest to a wider circle of readers than the peers in a specialised area. One could expect papers with this tag to be mentioned more often on Facebook and Twitter than those without this tag. The results from regression models were able to confirm these expectations: papers with this tag show significantly higher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers without this tag. This clear association could not be seen with Mendeley or Figshare counts (that is with counts from platforms which are chiefly of interest in a scientific context). Originality/value – The results of the current study indicate that Facebook and Twitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, might provide an indication of which papers are of interest to a broader circle of readers (and not only for the peers in a specialist area), and could therefore be useful for the measurement of the societal impact of research.","research , social networks , researchers , scientometrics , datasets , science , social networks , informetrics , confidence intervals , readers , regression models",lutz bornmann,usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader impact of research,aslib journal of information management

The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach - The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings - The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications - The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value - Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful. This research measures the AWDs influence on companies under webometric terms for the first time.","studies , web sites , information systems , heavy construction , search engines , information architecture , spain","enrique orduna-malea, emilio delgado lopez-cozar, jorge serrano-cobos, nuria lloret romero",disclosing the network structure of private companies on the web the case of spanish ibex 35 share index,online information review

While for a small group both concepts are clearly different, a large part of the community tends to regard usage metrics as a subset of altmetrics. From our point of view this use of terminology is not appropriate, and can easily lead to unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings reflected in a distorted scientific communication. In what follows we will argue why a distinction should be made between the two terms ‘usage metrics’ and ‘altmetrics’. The main reason is of historical nature. Usage metrics have already been around much longer than altmetrics. In fact, usage metrics are even older than citation metrics, because librarians have been tracking usage since the beginning of their profession, ranging from basic user surveys to the usage tracking of physical journal issues and monographs to library loan statistics to the sophisticated ...",", bibliometrics, terminology, transaction log analysis, user behaviour","wolfgang glanzel, juan gorraiz",usage metrics versus altmetrics confusing terminology,scientometrics

Design/methodology/approach - Personal publication lists of scientists of the field of information science were analyzed. All data were taken in collaboration with the scientists in order to guarantee complete publication lists. Findings - The demonstrated calibration parameter shows the coverage of information services in the field of information science. None of the investigated databases reached a coverage of 100 percent. However Google Scholar covers a greater amount of publications than other academic citation databases and scientific social media. Research limitations/implications - Results were limited to the publications of scientists working at an information science department from 2003 to 2012 at German-speaking universities. Practical implications - Scientists of the field of information science are encouraged to review their publication strategy in case of quality and quantity.

In this paper alternative metrics exploring a variety of formal and informal communication channels were proposed, with the aim of better reflecting SSH scholarship. Data for a group of SSH scholars in Taiwan on these metrics were collected. Principal component analysis revealed four underlying dimensions represented by the 18 metrics. Multiple-regression analyses were then performed to examine how well each of these dimensions predicted the academic standing of the scholars, measured by the number of public grants awarded and prestigious research awards received. Differences in the significance of the predictors were found between the social sciences and humanities. The results suggest the need to consider disciplinary differences when evaluating scholarly performance.

In addition, the paper aims to discover the benefits, disadvantages and barriers involved in the use of online communities, and especially in regard to the trust and authority issues, so important in scholarly communications. Design/methodology/approach – A layered, mixed-methods approach was used for this complex research topic. Interviews were undertaken with social science and humanities researchers, followed up with focus groups in both the USA and UK. This qualitative work was then followed up with an online questionnaire that generated over 1,000 responses. Findings – Over half the sample had experience of an online research community and a majority of researchers are making at least occasional use of one or more Web 2.0 services for communicating their research activity; for developing and sustaining networks and collaboration; or for finding out what others are doing. Big differences exist in membership rates according to subject, but not really by age or other demographic factors. The biggest benefit to joining an online community is the ability to seek information in one’s own specialism. Younger researchers are more engaged with online communities. Research limitations/implications – The qualitative research was limited to the UK and USA. While use of online communities is now accepted by both established and younger researchers, the main ways of communicating research remain scholarly journals and books. Practical implications – The implications for learned societies and publishers are not clear. Journals are confirmed as the primary way of disseminating research. However, it would be easy for these stakeholders to miss how younger researchers expect to connect in digital communities. Social implications – With researchers of all ages accepting the existing and importance of online communities and connections, there are few technical or social barriers to using mainstream digital tools to connect professionally. Originality/value – There is little published research considering the role of online research communities, so the study is highly original. It is valuable to discover that researchers still prefer to share research findings primarily through journals, rather than through social technologies.","teaching , higher education , web 2.0 , community relations , journals , collaboration , journals , consumption , demographics , studies , cooperation , communication , social networks , scholars , online instruction , researchers , digitization , scholarly communication , social research , books","hamid r jamali, bill russell, david nicholas, anthony watkinson",do online communities support research collaboration,aslib journal of information management

Yet, little is known about the altmetric impact of research fields in the humanities. Consequently, this paper analyses the altmetric coverage and impact of humanities-oriented articles and books published by Swedish universities during 2012. Some of the most common altmetric sources are examined using a sample of 310 journal articles and 54 books. Mendeley has the highest coverage of journal articles (61%) followed by Twitter (21%) while very few of the publications are mentioned in blogs or on Facebook. Books, on the other hand, are quite often tweeted while both Mendeley's and the novel data source Library Thing's coverage is low. Many of the problems of applying bibliometrics to the humanities are also relevant for altmetric approaches; the importance of non-journal publications, the reliance on print as well the limited coverage of non-English language publications. However, the continuing development and diversification of methods suggests that altmetrics could evolve into a valuable tool for assessing research in the humanities.

Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products in the social web. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians examining both their own use of online platforms and the use of their papers on social reference managers. As expected, coverage varied: 82 % of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28 % were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation counts. We conducted a survey among the participants of the STI2012 participants. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68 % of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72 % valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.

The researchers tended to share more links and retweet more than the average Twitter users in earlier research and there were clear disciplinary differences in how they used Twitter. Biochemists retweeted substantially more than researchers in the other disciplines. Researchers in digital humanities and cognitive science used Twitter more for conversations, while researchers in economics shared the most links.

OA scholarship has had it pretty tough, wanting to be valued in the same way its paywall counterparts are, but needing at the same time to disavow paywall value metrics. It might just be time for open access (OA) to ditch the banner of paywall parity altogether and opt for a new standard, one that says something along the lines of: content is content regardless of how it gets into our hands; peer review is one way to vet content, but peer review is largely a game of branding. This freeing up of choice for how we want to vet content is where altmetrics come in. These measurements can take shape as blog post mentions, Twitter citations, use of an article within citation managers like Mendeley and Zotero, user downloads on data-sharing platforms like figshare for the most part, any online arena that doesn't have representation within traditional metric rubrics can potentially be tracked through various altmetric engines. In the end, better and more varied evaluation is not merely a function of gatekeeping, but a step toward freeing content from profiteerism and allowing it to freely enter the terrain of real knowledge sharing.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the professional and educational implications of current and emerging research support environments for academic libraries, particularly with regard to research data management and bibliometrics and discuss how do professionals and educators &quot;make space&quot; as new service demands arise? Design/methodology/approach - The present paper uses data from a recent survey of research support provision by academic libraries in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Ireland, (authors 2013), and provides additional in depth analysis of the textual responses to extend the analysis in the light of forces for change in higher education. The original online questionnaire surveyed current and planned research support in academic libraries, and constraints or support needs related to service developments. It was distributed to 219 institutions in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Ireland, and obtained 140 valid responses (response rate of 63.9 percent). Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics with thematic categorization and coding for the textual responses. Findings - Most academic libraries surveyed are already providing or planning services in the focal areas of bibliometrics and data management. There was also increasing demand for other research support services, not the focus of the study, such as eresearch support, journal publishing platforms, and grant writing support. The authors found that while many academic libraries perceive increasing research support services as a &quot;huge opportunity&quot; they were constrained by gaps in staff skills, knowledge, and confidence and resourcing issues. With regard to staff education and training, it was reported they require a broader understanding of the changing research and scholarly landscape, the research cultures of different disciplines, and technological change. There was a near-universal support for development of more comprehensive, specialized, LIS education to prepare professionals for broader research support roles. Originality/value - This further analysis of the implications of our survey in relation to influences such as economics, academic culture, technology, raises questions for both educators and practitioners about the future direction of the profession and how the authors collectively &quot;make space&quot; as new potential services arise.","academic libraries , bibliometrics , research data management , scholarly communication , librarians , research methodology , australia , ireland , new zealand , united kingdom--uk","mary anne kennan, sheila corrall, waseem afzal",making space in practice and education research support services in academic libraries,library management

While peer review and bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics.

It is therefore important to identify factors affecting citation scores that are unrelated to scholarly quality or usefulness so that these can be taken into account. Regression is the most powerful statistical technique to identify these factors and hence it is important to identify the best regression strategy for citation data. Citation counts tend to follow a discrete lognormal distribution and, in the absence of alternatives, have been investigated with negative binomial regression. Using simulated discrete lognormal data (continuous lognormal data rounded to the nearest integer) this article shows that a better strategy is to add one to the citations, take their log and then use the general linear (ordinary least squares) model for regression (e.g., multiple linear regression, ANOVA), or to use the generalised linear model without the log. Reasonable results can also be obtained if all the zero citations are discarded, the log is taken of the remaining citation counts and then the general linear model is used, or if the generalised linear model is used with the continuous lognormal distribution. Similar approaches are recommended for altmetric data, if it proves to be lognormally distributed.

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag 'good for teaching' do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented ('new finding'). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact. If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.

Although some scholars have taken advantage of these new online opportunities, it is not clear how widespread their uptake is or how much impact they can have. This study assesses the extent to which successful scientists have social web presences, focusing on one influential group: highly cited researchers working at European institutions. It also assesses the impact of these presences. We manually and systematically identified if the European highly cited researchers had profiles in Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Mendeley, Academia and LinkedIn or any content in SlideShare. We then used URL mentions and altmetric indicators to assess the impact of the web presences found. Although most of the scientists had an institutional website of some kind, few had created a profile in any social website investigated, and LinkedIn-the only non-academic site in the list-was the most popular. Scientists having one kind of social web profile were more likely to have another in many cases, especially in the life sciences and engineering.

The purpose of this paper is to break new ground in understanding the various versions GS indexes, correlations between the number of GS versions and citation counts, and the value of institutional repositories for increasing scholarly impact. Design/methodology/approach - GS listings for 982 articles in several academic subjects from three universities were analyzed for GS version types, including any institutional repository versions, citation rates, and availability of free full-text. Findings - First, open access articles were cited more than articles that were not available in free full-text. While journal publisher web sites were indexed most often, only a small number of those articles were available as free full-text. Second, there is no correlation between the number of versions of an article and the number of times an article has been cited. Third, viewing the ""versions"" of an article may be useful when publisher access is restricted, as over 70 percent of articles had at least one free full-text version available through an indexed GS version. Originality/value - This paper investigates GS versions as an alternative source for a scholarly article. While other articles have looked at GS through various lenses, the authors believe this specific aspect of the topic has not been previously explored.","archives & records , studies , social networks , subscriptions , graduate students , metadata , indexing services , hirsch index , institutional repositories","scott p. pitol, sandra l. de groote",google scholar versions do more versions of an article mean greater impact,library hi tech

Design/methodology/approach - The total number of records and those belonging to the most reputable journals (1,762) and organizations (346) according to the Field Rating indicator in each of the 15 fields and 204 sub-fields of MAS, have been collected and statistically analysed in March 2014, by means of an automated querying process via http, covering academic publications from 1700 to present. Findings - MAS has no longer been updated since 2013, although this phenomenon began to be glimpsed in 2011, when its coverage plummeted. Throughout 2014, indexing of new records is still ongoing, but at a minimum rate, without following any apparent pattern. Research limitations/implications - There are also retrospective records being indexed at present. In this sense, this research provides a picture of what MAS offered during March 2014 being queried directly via http. Practical implications - The unnoticed obsolescence of MAS affects to the quality of the service offered to its users (both those who engage in scientific information seeking and also those who use it for quantitative purposes). Social implications - The predominance of Google Scholar (GS) as monopoly in the academic search engines market as well as the prevalence of an open construction model (GS) vs a closed model (MAS). Originality/value - A complete longitudinal analysis of disciplines, journals and organizations on MAS has been performed for the first time identifying an unnoticed obsolescence.

In this study, we compare Mendeley readership counts with citations for different social sciences and humanities disciplines. The overall correlation between Mendeley readership counts and citations for the social sciences was higher than for the humanities. Low and medium correlations between Mendeley bookmarks and citation counts in all the investigated disciplines suggest that these measures reflect different aspects of research impact. Mendeley data were also used to discover patterns of information flow between scientific fields. Comparing information flows based on Mendeley bookmarking data and cross-disciplinary citation analysis for the disciplines revealed substantial similarities and some differences. Thus, the evidence from this study suggests that Mendeley readership data could be used to help capture knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines, especially for people that read but do not author articles, as well as giving impact evidence at an earlier stage than is possible with citation counts.

Journal articles have not only been made available electronically, but are often available in different versions. This increasingly complex landscape requires increasingly complex metrics, both to aid with the filtering of content and to ensure that researchers receive the credit that they deserve. This offers both challenges and opportunities to the information professional. Scientometrics, the quantitative measurement and analysis of science, has traditionally made use of the citations from one article to another to investigate the impact of research. Publication metrics that have gained the most interest are those from publishers' websites and large social network sites. In addition, the sharing and mentioning of scientific articles on social network sites such as Twitter and Facebook forms the basis of altmetrics, alternative metrics making use of the large quantities of structured data that these sites provide to demonstrate impact beyond the traditional confines of scientific discourse. These new types of publication require new metrics. It is important to know not only how many times has a data publication been cited but how integrated the dataset is into the semantic web. Similarly, its not just about how many times has the computer code been reused, but how many times has it been independently developed and these new versions used. The potential wealth of metrics still requires a lot of work, through standardisation in the way that data is collected and reported from individual sites, and in the way the data is aggregated from multiple sites. There seems to be an inevitability to publication metrics having an increasingly important role within information services, both for filtering and the attribution of credit. Nonetheless it is important that caution is taken when applying the metrics.

Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication frequency. Findings - A moderate negative correlation (r=-0.339) is found between the number of publications and tweets per day, while retweet and citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and abstracts is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting behavior such as retweeting and including hashtags, usernames and URLs.

Results are not necessarily representative of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter and they most certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should apply the methods to a larger set of researchers and other scientific disciplines.

456,A New Method and Metric to Evaluate the Peer Review Process of Scholarly Journals,Scholarly Journals,adam etkin,10.1007/s12109-013-9339-y,Journal Article,1,English,2014,30," Scholarly publishing , Ethics , Peer review , Algorithms , Ethics , Libraries , Journals (Academic) , Algorithms",,Publishing Research Quarterly,,"This paper will propose a new system that produces a metric that is an indicator of the level of peer review conducted prior to the publication of scholarly material. A mathematical algorithm which incorporates weighted values of the roles within the peer review process is created. The h-index, which is a value that ""measures the productivity and impact of a scientist or scholar,"" is also incorporated. Each round of review is weighted using the square root as later rounds of peer review are often less rigorous than earlier rounds. Once a paper is accepted the calculation is conducted and a ""peer review evaluation"" metric, or ""Peer Review Evaluation Score"" (pre-SCORE) is available. It is clear that such a metric would prove beneficial to all engaged parties (authors, publishers, readers, libraries). Authors will know that their work is being evaluated by a trustworthy publication and by experts in their field. Legitimate, ethical publishers will be recognized as such. Readers would have the ability to filter out material which was not properly vetted, and libraries/consortia would have further assurance that their limited funds are spent wisely. Future studies to see if there is a correlation between the pre-SCORE and Impact Factor or highly cited material is possible. The proposed metric would be one more tool available to aid in the discovery of quality published research.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","scholarly publishing , ethics , peer review , algorithms , ethics , libraries , journals (academic) , algorithms",adam etkin,a new method and metric to evaluate the peer review process of scholarly journals,publishing research quarterly

These new metrics can, in theory, be used in an evaluative role, to give early estimates of the impact of publications or to give estimates of non-traditional types of impact. They can also be used as an information seeking aid: to help draw a digital library users attention to papers that have attracted social web mentions. If altmetrics are to be trusted then they must be evaluated to see if the claims made about them are reasonable. Drawing upon previous citation analysis debates and web citation analysis research, this article discusses altmetric evaluation strategies, including correlation tests, content analyses, interviews and pragmatic analyses. It recommends that a range of methods are needed for altmetric evaluations, that the methods should focus on identifying the relative strengths of influences on altmetric creation, and that such evaluations should be prioritised in a logical order.

In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other. Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era.

In seven out of the nine cases, there were no significant differences between the article types in terms of citation counts and FFa scores. Nevertheless, citation counts and FFa scores were significantly different for two article types: 'New finding' and 'Changes clinical practice': FFa scores value the appropriateness of medical research for clinical practice and 'New finding' articles are more highly cited.

But times are changing. The role of information and data at other stages of the research cycle is increasingly interesting to publishers, and technology is being used more to integrate what were traditionally disparate roles. This trend is reflected in recent high-profile developments such as Elsevier's purchase of the reference-sharing service Mendeley and Springer's purchase of Papers last year.

By monitoring the downloads of scientific articles in the journal of Scientometrics for 744 h, namely one month, we investigate the download statistics. Then we aggregate the keywords in these downloaded research papers, and analyze the trends of article downloading and keyword downloading. Furthermore, taking both the downloads of keywords and articles into consideration, we design a method to detect the emerging research trends. We find that in scientometrics field, social media, new indices to quantify scientific productivity (g-index), webometrics, semantic, text mining, and open access are emerging fields that scientometrics researchers are focusing on.

Altmetrics are being touted as a faster, fairer, and potentially more relevant way to assess an adjunct professor's suitability for being granted tenure. In other words, altmetrics bring ""publish or perish"" into the digital age, providing new measures that give scholars credit not only for being cited online but for playing a role in shaping academic research and discussion through nonacademic journal venues. The term 'altmetrics' is short for ""alternative metrics."" These are a range of nontraditional metrics that can be used to assess the impact that scholars have on research in their areas of study. They can include the number of article downloads, citation of research in online news/social media sources, Mendeley bookmarks (a web-based system for sharing and extracting information from PDFs and other electronic documents), and nontraditional forms of scholarship.

In this paper some possible limitations of the new indicators are presented. More specifically these shortcomings are: 1) a large number of information sources and indicators that make it difficult to establish their classification and relevance; 2) some indicators that have no statistical validity because they generate poor results; 3) the difficulty of determining the meaning of the new metrics -- what are we assessing, scientific or social impact?; and 4) the evanescent and ephemeral nature of these new sources and indicators.

Librarians are responding with service innovations in areas such as bibliometrics and research data management. Previous surveys have investigated research data support within North America and other research services globally with small samples. An online multiple-choice questionnaire was used to survey bibliometric and data support activities of 140 libraries in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, including current and planned services, target audiences, service constraints, and stafftraining needs. A majority of respondents offered or planned bibliometrics training, citation reports, and impact calculations but with significant differences between countries. Current levels of engagement in data management were lower than for bibliometrics, but a majority anticipated future involvement, especially in technology assistance, data deposit, and policy development. Initiatives were aimed at multiple constituencies, with university administrators being important clients and partners for bibliometric services. Gaps in knowledge, skills, and confidence were significant constraints, with near-universal support for including bibliometrics and particularly data management in professional education and continuing development programs. The study also found that librarians need a multilayered understanding of the research environment.

January 2013 sees the launch of the submissions systems for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014, the new system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutions. Bibliometric data such as citations will be used by the REF panels as part of their deliberation. While publications are still a key part of that analysis, panels are explicitly forbidden to consider the impact factor of a journal where those publications appear, when assessing the article's impact or importance. Alongside that, we see the rise of 'altmetrics' and 'scientometrics' -- new ways of looking at the usefulness and impact of research outputs that take into account references outside of the journal article , including social media and news stories. This article provides a brief introduction to some of the most commonly talked-about metrics. It also highlights some of the tools available to gather and analyse metrics.

However, underlying this apparent inertia, there is an alternative approach that may emerge over the next few years as known problems move into the foreground, and a number of key social and technical issues are resolved. Furthermore, the industry of science and scientific communication are not isolated from the current economic epoch: collaboration and cost-effectiveness are strong drivers for change. The technological components of this new scholarly universe -- natural language processing, semantic technologies such as taxonomies, ontologies and linking -- will come together with collaborative innovations inspired by Web 2.0 social media. The final components in recreating a new publishing model are identity and reward, and these are being resolved by the forthcoming Open Research and Contributor ID (ORCID) project and the altmetrics movement respectively.

If the use of such technologies is to be encouraged it is important that we have appropriate ways of measuring the impact of the new methods of publication. Attention has been described as the currency of academia, but at the moment many of the most innovative researchers, who are embracing the opportunities the new technologies offer, are being short-changed by the ways research is judged. Web 2.0 technologies provide the opportunity for research assessment to be based on a far larger corpus of documents than traditional citation analysis, allow a far wider range of research activity to be captured more quickly, and are potentially more difficult to abuse. The changing publishing environment has led to the call for alternative metrics (altmetrics.org/manifesto), which better reflect today's research practices and take advantage of the use of current social media technologies. For such metrics to have an impact, however, they need to be widely accepted by the research community and be seen to reflect real engagement rather than the buzz of newsworthy, rather than academic-worthy, research.
