Title = {{Analysis of the original influencing factors and secondary influencing
   factors of academic papers}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The influencing factors of academic papers have always been the
   focus of attention in the field of Scientometrics. Exploring the
   influencing factors of altmetrics indicators and traditional literature
   indicators on academic papers is beneficial to better explore the
   potential significance and value of academic papers in the evaluation of
   scientific research. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach Based on the latest JCR citation report,
   this paper selects 22 academic journals in the JIF Quartile Q1 journal
   of Information Science and Library Science, and then obtains the
   evaluation data of these journal papers from WOS database and
   Altmetric.com. This paper uses literature measurement, correlation
   analysis and regression analysis to explore the influencing factors of
   the paper. Findings The results show that the original influencing
   factors of academic papers have a significant impact on secondary
   influencing factors. What is more obvious is that the number of
   references (nr) presents a significant positive correlation with the
   total number of times (Z9), the number of uses (U1) and (U2).
   Originality/value This paper combines traditional literature indicators
   with Altmetrics indicators to study the influencing factors through
   primary influencing factors and secondary influencing factors. Through
   research, it denies the phenomenon that academic circles have published
   academic papers in the world in recent years to overemphasize certain
   factors to improve the influence of the paper.}},

Title = {{Analyzing the relationship between Altmetric score and literature
   citations in the Implantology literature}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL IMPLANT DENTISTRY AND RELATED RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Background The influence of research has long been studied using
   citations and impact factors (IFs). Electronic media is changing how
   people interact with the scientific literature. There are few
   investigations into these trends. Purpose To explore whether Altmetrics
   correlate with traditional bibliometrics in the Implantology literature.
   Materials and Methods Five Implantology journals with the highest IF and
   the 10 most highly-cited articles within those journals from 2013 to
   2016 were reviewed. Altmetric score, citation count, and media
   ``mentions{''} were recorded. Comparisons were conducted between
   Altmetric score, citations, and IF by performing Pearson correlation
   coefficients and descriptive statistics. Twitter accounts were studied
   and compared to other metrics. Results Analysis revealed no correlation
   between citations and Altmetrics (r = .096,P = .506) or IF and
   Altmetrics (r = .111,P = .443) in 2013. Altmetrics were also not
   significantly correlated with citations (r = 0.148,P = .305) or IF (r =
   .145,P = .315) in 2016. Total Altmetric scores were nine times higher in
   2016 compared to 2013, with news outlets and Twitter seeing large
   increases in mentions. Twitter was the top medium receiving mentions
   across the two cohorts. Conclusions Compared to other fields,
   Implantology articles received lower Altmetric scores, noting an area of
   improvement. Altmetrics at this time are insufficient to replace
   traditional bibliometrics, but may provide helpful real-time information
   concerning article dissemination.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background. Altmetrics analyze the visibility of articles in social
   media and estimate their impact on the general population. We performed
   an altmetric analysis of articles on central nervous system inflammatory
   demyelinating disease (CIDD) and investigated its correlation with
   citation analysis. Methods. Articles in the 91 journals comprising the
   ``clinical neurology,{''} ``neuroscience,{''} and ``medicine, general,
   and internal{''} Web of Science categories were searched for their
   relevance to the CIDD topic. The Altmetric Explorer database was used to
   determine the Altmetric.com Attention Score (AAS) values of the selected
   articles. The papers with the top 100 AAS values were characterized.
   Results. Articles most frequently mentioned online were primarily
   published after 2014 and were published in journals with high impact
   factors. All articles except one were dealt with the issue of multiple
   sclerosis. Most were original articles, but editorials were also common.
   Novel treatments and risk factors are the most frequent topics. The AAS
   was weakly correlated with journal impact factors; however, no link was
   found between the AAS and the number of citations. Conclusions. We
   present the top 100 most frequently mentioned CIDD articles in online
   media using an altmetric approach. Altmetrics can rapidly offer
   alternative information on the impact of research based on a broader
   audience and can complement traditional metrics.}},

Title = {{Examining the Correlation Between Altmetric Score and Citations in the
   Urology Literature}},
Journal = {{UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{45-50}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To determine if article Altmetric scores correlate with
   journal impact factor and citation count in the urologic literature.
   METHODS We identified the top 10 most-cited articles for the 15 urology
   journals with the highest impact factor in 2013 and 2016. Citation count
   and Altmetric scores were recorded for each of the articles. The journal
   impact factor and date of Twitter account development were recorded for
   each of the journals. The variables were analyzed in Microsoft excel
   using Pearson's correlation testing.
   RESULTS A total of 300 articles were analyzed. In 2013, Altmetric scores
   and citation number showed a significant positive correlation (r =
   0.164, P = .045), although Altmetric scores did not correlate with
   journal impact factor (r = 0.005, P = .957). In 2016, there was
   significant positive correlation between Altmetric scores and citation
   number (r = 0.268, P = .0009), as well as between Altmetric scores and
   journal impact factor (r = 0.201, P = .014). The total citation count
   decreased from 15,235 in 2013 to 8622 in 2016 while the total Altmetric
   score increased from 1135 in 2013 to 2563 in 2016. Older Twitter
   accounts were not associated with increasing correlations between
   Altmetric score and bibliometrics in either 2013 (r = 0.221, P = .54) or
   2016 (r = 0.083, P = .819).
   CONCLUSION At this point in time, Altmetric score is only weakly
   correlated with citation counts in the urology literature. Altmetrics
   and traditional bibliometrics should be viewed as complements to one
   another rather than surrogates when determining research dissemination
   and impact. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.}},

   investigation for Chinese collaboration publications}},
Journal = {{LIBRARY HI TECH}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide insights on the
   improvement of academic impact and social attention of Chinese
   collaboration articles from the perspective of altmetrics.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors retrieved articles which are
   from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and indexed by Nature Index
   as sampled articles. With the methods of distribution analysis,
   comparative analysis and correlation analysis, authors compare the
   coverage differences of altmetric sources for CAS Chinese articles and
   CAS international articles, and analyze the correlation between the
   collaborative information and the altmetric indicators. Findings Results
   show that the coverage of altmetric sources for CAS international
   articles is greater than that for CAS Chinese articles. Mendeley and
   Twitter cover a higher percentage of collaborative articles than other
   sources studied. Collaborative information, such as number of
   collaborating countries, number of collaborating institutions, and
   number of collaborating authors, show moderate or low correlation with
   altmetric indicator counts. Mendeley readership has a moderate
   correlation with altmetric indicators like tweets, news outlets and blog
   posts. Practical implications - International scientific collaboration
   at different levels improves attention, academic impact and social
   impact of articles. International collaboration and altmetrics
   indicators supplement each other. The results of this study can help us
   better understand the relationship between altmetrics indicators of
   articles and collaborative information of articles. It is of great
   significance to evaluate the influence of Chinese articles, as well as
   help to improve the academic impact and social attention of Chinese
   collaboration articles. Originality/value To the best of authors'
   knowledge, few studies focus on the use of altmetrics to assess
   publications produced through Chinese academic collaboration. This study
   is one of a few attempts that include the number of collaborating
   countries, number of collaborating institutions, and number of
   collaborating authors of scientific collaboration into the discussion of
   altmetric indicators and figured out the relationship among them.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the presence of highly
   cited papers of Nature in social media websites and tools. It also tries
   to examine the correlation between altmetric and bibliometric
   indicators. Design/methodology/approach This descriptive study was
   carried out using altmetric indicators. The research sample consisted of
   1,000 most-cited articles in Nature. In February 2019, the bibliographic
   information of these articles was extracted from the Scopus database.
   Then, the titles of all articles were manually searched on Google, and
   by referring to the article in the journal website and altmetric
   institution, the data related to social media presence and altmetric
   score of articles were collected. The data were analyzed using Microsoft
   Excel and SPSS. Findings According to the results of the study, from
   1,000 articles, 989 of them (98.9 per cent) were mentioned at least once
   in different social media websites and tools. The most used altmetric
   source in highly cited articles was Mendeley (98.9 per cent), followed
   by Citeulike (79.8 per cent) and Wikipedia (69.4 per cent). Most Tweets,
   blog posts, Facebook posts, news stories, readers in Mendeley, Citeulike
   and Connotea and Wikipedia citations belonged to the article titled
   ``Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree
   search{''}. The highest altmetric score was 3,135 which belonged to this
   paper. Most tweeters and articles' readers were from the USA. The
   membership type of the tweeters was public membership. In terms of
   fields of study, most readers were PhD students in Agricultural and
   Biological Sciences. Finally, the results of Spearman's Correlation
   revealed positive significant statistical correlation between all
   altmetric indicators and received citations of highly cited articles
   (p-value = 0.0001). Practical implications - The results of this study
   can help researchers, editors and editorial boards of journals better
   understand the importance and benefits of using social media and tools
   to publish articles. Originality/value Altmetrics is a relatively new
   field, and in particular, there are not many studies related to the
   presence of articles in various social media until now. Accordingly, in
   this study, a comprehensive altmetric analysis was carried out on 1000
   most-cited articles of one of the world's most reliable journals.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the similarities
   and differences between the Twitter users who tweeted on journal
   articles in psychology and political science disciplines.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from Web of
   Science, Altmetric.com, and Twitter. A total of 91,826 tweets with
   22,541 distinct Twitter user profiles for psychology discipline and
   29,958 tweets with 10,478 distinct Twitter user profiles for political
   science discipline were used for analysis. The demographics analysis
   includes gender, geographic location, individual or organization user,
   academic or non-academic background, and psychology/political science
   domain knowledge background. A machine learning approach using support
   vector machine (SVM) was used for user classification based on the
   Twitter user profile information. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
   topic modeling was used to discover the topics that the users discussed
   from the tweets.
   Findings - Results showed that the demographics of Twitter users who
   tweeted on psychology and political science are significantly different.
   Tweets on journal articles in psychology reflected more the impact of
   scientific research finding on the general public and attracted more
   attention from the general public than the ones in political science.
   Disciplinary difference in term of user demographics exists, and thus it
   is important to take the discipline into consideration for future
   altmetrics studies.

Abstract = {{Tweet: \#Altmetrics can shape how \#leisure scholars think about sharing
   \#research for greater public impact @LeisureSciences. Altmetrics, or
   ``alternative metrics{''} measure scholarly and public engagement with
   scholarship through traditional metrics (e.g., citation counts) and
   contemporary metrics (e.g., mentions on social media and news outlets in
   real time). Since their emergence in 2010, they now play a role in the
   tenure process and factor into how scholars write articles and engage
   with social media to increase public consumption of their research
   (bridging the public/ivory tower/practitioner divide). In this research
   note, we describe altmetrics and answer some questions surrounding them.
   Questions we explore include: What are altmetrics? How are they
   calculated? What are the benefits of measuring scholarship in this way?
   What tensions exist in measuring scholarship in this way? How can
   leisure scholars engage with altmetrics? And why should leisure
   scholars/studies care about altmetrics?}},

Title = {{Altmetric analysis of the contemporary scientific literature in
   Endodontology}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL ENDODONTIC JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{AimTo analyse and visualize the knowledge structure of scientific
   articles in the field of Endodontology with high altmetric attention
   scores to discover hot topics, active researchers and the journals
   involved.
   MethodologyOn 5 June 2019, the altmetric database (Altmetric LLP,
   London, UK) was searched using the titles of 11 endodontic journals.
   Bibliometric data from endodontic articles and journals with an
   altmetric score >5 (top 5\%) were retrieved from PubMed and analysed
   using the VOSviewer. Science mapping of articles with an altmetric score
   >5 at two levels was created: author keywords co-occurrence and
   co-authorship network analysis.
   ResultsOf the 2197 articles in the field of Endodontology identified
   with altmetrics, 192 had altmetric scores >5 (top 5\%). Considering the
   total mentions amongst all altmetric resources, the Journal of
   Endodontics had the highest rank followed by the International
   Endodontic Journal and Australian Endodontic Journal. Twitter was the
   most popular altmetric data resource followed by patents and Facebook.
   Meta-analysis, systematic review and pulpitis were the hot topics. At
   the author level, Dummer P.M.H had the greatest influence on the
   network. There was no significant correlation between altmetric score
   and citations count (P > 0.05). Mendeley mentions correlated with
   citations (P < 0.05).
   ConclusionsOverall, the altmetric scores of topics within Endodontology
   were low, possibly due to the specific and specialized nature of the
   specialty, as well as the difficulty members of the public probably have
   in understanding endodontic research. Journals and researchers with a
   focus on Endodontology would have more influence if they were to set-up
   their own social media profiles and thus enhance their visibility and
   social impact by immediately sharing research findings and communicating
   with their network and audience.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the study was to analyse the literature production
   on application of bibliometrics in nursing research.
   Methods: Historical, descriptive, and exploratory bibliometrics analyses
   were used. The papers were harvested from the Scopus bibliographical
   database (Elsevier, Maribor, Netherlands), on November 18th, 2018, using
   the search string bibliometric{*} in publication titles, abstracts, and
   keywords, limited to the subject of nursing, for the period 1970 to
   2018.
   Findings: The search resulted in 531 publications with 18 publications
   removed after manual inspection of publications abstracts. The
   literature production trend was positive. The nursing specific
   historical roots appeared only recently. The United States of America
   and Spain were the most productive countries, and most papers were
   published in Nutricion Hospitalaria and the Journal of Advanced Nursing.
   Descriptive analysis, research evaluation, content analysis, citation
   analyses, and trend analysis in nursing research were the most prolific
   themes.
   Conclusions: Applications of bibliometric in nursing is comparable to
   bibliometrics use in general, however there are some gaps including the
   use of altmetrics and of Big Data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The impact of a scientific article has traditionally been
   measured by the impact factor (IF) of the journal it is published in and
   the number of times it is cited. However, citations have a lag period
   before the true impact of an article can be determined. The Altmetric
   score has emerged as a measure of the digital dissemination of a
   scientific article across multiple platforms, including Tweets, Facebook
   likes, and other social and popular media mentions. We hypothesized that
   Altmetric score would correlate with citations and journal IF in
   pediatric surgery.
   Methods: Using the previously identified 14 core journals of pediatric
   surgery, the top ten most-cited articles from each of these journals
   were identified for the year 2012, allowing for 5+ y of follow-up. For
   each article, we determined the number of times cited and the Altmetric
   score. For each journal, the 2012 IF and year in which the journal's
   Twitter account was established were determined. Bibliometric data were
   collected for the year 2015 to allow comparison of Altmetric scores
   across years. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation
   coefficients were determined using the GraphPad PRISM software.
   Results: Citation information for n = 140 articles from 2012 to 2015 was
   obtained. In 2012, articles were cited 56,159 times (median 192, range
   21-5029), and the median Altmetric score was 8 (range 0-4261). Citations
   correlated strongly with journal IF (r = 0.82, P < 0.0001). Altmetric
   scores in 2012 showed weak positive correlation with citations (r =
   0.1895, P = 0.0125) but did not correlate with IF (r = 0.0841, P =
   0.1617). Altmetric scores in 2015 also showed weak positive correlation
   with citations (r = 0.238, P = 0.0023) but additionally weakly
   correlated with IF (r = 0.2027, P = 0.0082). Increasing age of a
   journal's Twitter account resulted in increasing correlation between
   Altmetric score and citations in both 2012 (r = 0.299, P = 0.169) and
   2015 (r = 0.512, P = 0.037). Twitter was the primary social media
   contributor to Altmetric score in 2012 and 2015, with decreasing
   contribution from Facebook.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to link traditional bibliometric
   measures with newer measures of digital dissemination for publications
   in pediatric surgery. Although the Altmetric score of the top cited
   articles did not correlate with journal IF, it did weakly correlate with
   citations. Interestingly, this correlation was strongest for journals
   with wellestablished Twitter accounts, indicating that, over time, the
   Altmetric score may emerge as a tool to predict future citations.
   Currently, Altmetric and traditional bibliometric measures appear to
   have distinct but complementary roles in measuring dissemination and
   impact of scientific articles in pediatric surgery. (C) 2019 Elsevier

   to assess whether a correlation exists between the traditional impact

   Correlation was assessed through Spearman tests. 156 journals were
   analyzed, 17\% had at least one social network. 48.2\% of journals with
   social networks were classified within SJR's quartile 1. An almost
   perfect correlation was found between the SJR and the number of

   significant after adjusting for time since creation of the account
   {[}Spearman's correlation (r(s)) = 0.83]. We propose the use of Twitter

Abstract = {{Aim In the present study, we aimed to identify and analyze the
   characteristics of highly cited articles in dentistry. Methods All
   articles belonging to Web of Science category of ``dentistry, oral
   surgery and medicine{''} published until 2016 were analyzed. The
   bibliometric data of the highly cited articles were evaluated. The
   Y-index was applied to assess authors' publication potential. Altmetric
   scores were recorded from Dimensions, a free online database. Results
   There were 3666 highly cited dentistry articles published in dental
   journals. Half of them were published in seven leading journals in their
   specialties. The major contributing countries were the USA, Sweden, the
   UK, and Switzerland. The highly cited articles were written by 3.7
   authors on average. Jan Lindhe had the largest number of highly cited
   articles, whereas David H. Pashley had the highest potential to publish
   highly cited articles in dentistry. Conclusions Highly cited articles
   were distributed among various dental specialties, and the most
   productive periods were the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The Y-index

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The use of online video by universities to communicate with their
   community is increasingly growing, however, the effect of the university
   characteristics on the online video impact remains overwhelmingly
   unstudied. Previous research has found a relation between research
   performance and the online video impact of the most prestigious
   universities (world-class universities). The objective of this study is
   twofold. Firstly, we aim to check whether this relation can be
   generalised by means of a correlation analysis. Secondly, a model is
   introduced to explain how research performance affects online video
   impact and is empirically tested using the PLS-SEM technique. Results
   show that the positive relation between research performance and online
   video impact is restricted to the most prestigious universities. Among
   these, research performance shows a significant effect on online video
   impact, with the online video orientation of the university playing a
   positive moderating effect. Limitations are discussed and suggestions
   for further research are proposed.}},

Title = {{Who reads international Egyptian academic articles? An altmetrics
   analysis of Mendeley readership categories}},
Journal = {{SCIENTOMETRICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{105-135}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mendeley is a social network that allows researchers worldwide to
   discover, search and share resources and to cooperate with peer
   researchers. We can recognize a large amount of exhaustive information
   about who reads research articles and the contexts in which research
   articles are read by using data about people who register in Mendeley as
   readers of articles. The purpose of this paper is to explore different
   types of users of international Egyptian academic articles indexed in
   Scopus across four major fields: health sciences, life sciences,
   physical sciences and social sciences inside and outside academia. The
   aim is to determine the impact and use of international Egyptian
   academic articles in Mendeley compared to their citation impact and to
   explore whether there is any correlation between Mendeley readership
   counts and the citation indicators for these publications. Furthermore,
   this study analyses readers' categories and discovers their country
   locations according to the data retrieved from Mendeley profiles. The
   data for this study are collected from the Scopus database. Webometric
   Analyst 2.0 is used to retrieve Mendeley readership statistics for all
   collected articles. This information will help in understanding how and
   to what extent Mendeley readership metrics are applicable in assessing
   the publications of Egyptian authors and in understanding the usage
   versus citation pattern and impact of Egyptian scientific outputs on
   global society. The results indicate that the majority of readers in all
   disciplines are Ph.D. students, master's students, and post-graduate
   students; however, other types of academics are also represented. The
   findings also indicate that the highest correlations between citations
   and Mendeley readership counts are found for the types of users who
   frequently author academic papers, except for professors in some
   sub-disciplines. Regarding country locations, Egyptian international
   publications are mostly used by users from more than 100 countries
   worldwide. However, the majority in every field are from the USA.
   Overall, this study concludes that Egyptian researchers have great
   international influence on global society. The study suggests that
   Mendeley readership may reflect usage similarly to conventional citation
   impacts if the data are limited to readers who are also authors, without
   the delay of influence measured by citation indicators. Meanwhile,
   Mendeley data can disclose the invisible impact of research
   publications, such as educational value for non-author users inside
   academia or the impact of research papers on practice for users outside
   academia. Finally, Mendeley readership statistics can reflect the
   distribution of users in various countries and potential readers
   worldwide, identify the invisible impact of the research output per
   country on global society, and be used as a complementary and
   informative tool for citation databases in explicating the influence of
   scientific outputs.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-national distance among countries has been of central interest in
   International Business and Management research. Therefore, different
   efforts have been made to develop models/measurements to address this
   issue. In this article we identify the models/measurements of
   cross-national distance developed since the beginning of the 2000
   decade. After briefly presenting each model's distinctive features, we
   assess their impact on the research field based on a wide range of
   bibliometric techniques (direct, indirect, and adjusted citation
   impacts, altmetrics, academic reviews, journals and publishers'
   prestige). Our analysis shows that the narrower cultural distance
   construct has lost ground to the wider psychic distance one.
   Furthermore, researchers highly value those models and measurement that
   go beyond the cultural and psychic distance constructs providing a
   multidimensional framework to analyze and measure cross-national
   distance among countries. Our analysis of these models' impact shows
   that this a salient issue in the research field as a whole and a central
   topic in the highest ranked journals in International Business and

Abstract = {{This paper reports on book impact assessment using bibliometrics, usage
   metrics and altmetrics. The objective of the study is to investigate the
   citation, usage, reach and readership of scholarly books published by
   Springer Nature during a three-year time-span after their publication
   using citations, downloads, social media mentions and online reference
   manager bookmarks data. The study population was limited to those
   Springer books published in 2014, covering four broad disciplines (pure
   sciences, social sciences, engineering and medicine) to study
   disciplinary differences. The 3 years' span was chosen to make sure all
   books had enough time to attract citations, downloads, attentions and
   bookmarks. Data on 1116 randomly-selected books were obtained in July
   2018 and they contained the total number of times each book was cited in
   CrossRef.com, downloaded in Link.Springer.com, mentioned in
   altmetric.com, and bookmarked in Mendeley.com over a three-year time
   window from January 1, 2015 to December 30, 2017. Although books are the
   preferred publication format especially in arts, humanities and social
   sciences, the results of book assessment based on the citation, usage,
   social media metrics from social science discipline was not apparent.
   This is evident as books in pure sciences were more frequently cited,
   books in medicine received more social media attentions and engineering
   books had the highest download counts and Mendeley bookmarks. The
   results also demonstrated that Crossref citations and SpringerLink
   downloads correlated significantly in all four disciplines indicating
   books with more download statistics also accumulated higher citation
   counts. The study is significant to provide evidence that alternative
   sources such as usage-based and social media-based metrics could act as
   complement to traditional citation-based measures for assessing the
   impact of books and/or book chapters in a multidimensional way.}},

Title = {{Measuring the social impact of research in Paediatric Dentistry: An
   Altmetric study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC DENTISTRY}},
Abstract = {{Background Traditional metrics have been extensively used to evaluate
   the scientific performance. Despite being widespread accepted,
   citation-based metrics are not able to describe the social impact of
   research. A diverse metric, Altmetric, was proposed to overcome those
   limitations. Aim This study aims to analyse the social impact of
   research in the field of paediatric dentistry and to assess if a
   correlation exists between the JCR citations, the AAS score, and the
   recently released Dimensions citation count. Design A bibliometric study
   was conducted on the four journals related to Paediatric Dentistry
   listed in the JCR from 2014 to 2017. Descriptive statistics was used to
   describe the articles and the journals. Pearson's correlation analysis
   was used to explore the relationship among JCR citations, AAS, and
   Dimensions. Results The percentage of articles with an AAS presents a
   huge variability and was significantly higher in the International
   Journal of Paediatric Dentistry. In our sample, the correlation between
   the JCR citation count and the AAS was poor in the years 2014, 2015, and
   2016 and low in 2017. The correlation between JCR citation and
   Dimensions citation count was strong. Conclusions The social impact of
   research in paediatric dentistry can be increased. Dimensions could be
   an alternative to the JCR. Both the editors and the researcher should
   change their vision and facilitate the access to research information to
   scholar and non-scholar audiences.}},

Abstract = {{Scholarly articles are now increasingly being mentioned and discussed in
   social media platforms, sometimes even as pre- or post-print version
   uploads. Measures of social media mentions and coverage are now emerging
   as an alternative indicator of impact of scholarly articles. This
   article aims to explore how much scholarly research output from India is
   covered in different social media platforms, and how similar or
   different it is from the world average. It also analyses the
   discipline-wise variations in coverage and altmetric attention for
   Indian research output, including a comparison with the world average.
   Results obtained show interesting patterns. Only 28.5\% of the total
   research output from India is covered in social media platforms, which
   is about 18\% less than the world average. ResearchGate and Mendeley are
   the most popular social media platforms in India for scholarly article
   coverage. In terms of discipline-wise variation, medical sciences and
   biological sciences have relatively higher coverage across different
   platforms compared to disciplines like information science and
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetrics are a relatively new phenomenon in research. These metrics
   measure the attention that research articles receive from nontraditional
   venues such as social media and the Internet. This study examined how
   these metrics affect both the readership and citation of articles in

   indicated that all altmetrics positively correlated with citation.
   Posting articles on sites such as ResearchGate and Mendeley not only
   impacted readership, it increased the likelihood of citation. Other
   variables that improved readership and citation were social media

Abstract = {{In the modern age of connected world and social media, research outcomes
   that are of direct interest \& relevance to society are increasingly
   being shared and disseminated in news sources and social media
   platforms. Some studies have found that social media mentions of
   research papers can be an early indicator of their impact. India, which
   is now among the top 10 knowledge producers in the world, has more than
   900 Universities that contribute to its research output. This paper
   tries to analyze as to what proportion of research output from the 100
   most productive Indian institutions gets social media coverage. It is
   found that, while average social media coverage for India is around
   28.5\%, the coverage varies between 5\% to 60\% for different
   institutions. It is also observed that research output from institutions
   in some specific disciplines (such as Medical Science and Biological
   Science) attract more social media coverage as compared to others. The
   possible impact of geographical location (in a metro city) of an
   institution on social media coverage of its research output is analyzed
   as well. The findings present useful insight about social media coverage
   of research output of Indian institutions, which may be a proxy for
   societal relevance of the research work, and also indicate that suitable
   mechanisms need to be designed to promote dissemination of research
   results from Indian institutions in popular social media platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Altmetrics, or alternative metrics, have recently emerged as
   a web-based metrics measuring the impact of research with an emphasis on
   the public engagement with the research output. In this study, we aimed
   to identify and analyze research articles about oral cancer that
   provoked the most online attention. Methods Altmetric Explorer was used
   to identify articles about oral cancer that generated the highest online
   attention. Descriptive and correlational statistics were performed, and
   the top 100 articles were identified and analyzed. Results A total of
   7,940 articles were identified. Topics were mostly discussed on
   Facebook, Twitter, Mendeley, and news outlets. The top 100 articles that
   generated the highest online attention discussed mainly topics related
   to treatment outcomes and quality of life. Human papilloma virus (HPV)
   was the most commonly discussed individual topic in the list of top 100
   outputs (n = 20). Most articles originated from the USA (n = 46) and
   Europe (n = 33; mainly from UK {[}24 articles]). Articles were published
   in 47 journals that belong to different specialities; journals with a
   social media account had significantly higher Altmetric scores for their

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to analyze the publication
   output of postgraduate pediatric neurosurgery fellows for a 10-year
   period as well as identify 25 individual highly productive pediatric
   neurosurgeons. The correlation between academic productivity and the
   site of fellowship training was studied.
   METHODS Programs certified by the Accreditation Council for Pediatric
   Neurosurgery Fellowships that had 5 or more graduating fellows from 2006
   to 2015 were included for analysis. Fellows were queried using Scopus
   for publications during those 10 years with citation data through 2017.
   Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated, comparing program
   rankings of faculty against fellows using the revised Hirsch index
   (r-index; primary) and Hirsch index (h-index; secondary). A list of 25
   highly accomplished individual academicians and their fellowship
   training locations was compiled.
   RESULTS Sixteen programs qualified with 152 fellows from 2006 to 2015;
   136 of these surgeons published a total of 2009 articles with 23,735
   citations. Most publications were pediatric-specific (66.7\%) clinical
   articles (93.1\%), with middle authorship (55\%). Co-investigators were
   more likely from residency than fellowship. There was a clustering of
   the top 7 programs each having total publications of around 120 or
   greater, publications per fellow greater than 12, more than 1200
   citations, and adjusted ir10 (revised 10-year institutional h-index) and
   ih10 (10-year institutional h-index) values of approximately 2 or
   higher. Correlating faculty and fellowship program rankings yielded
   correlation coefficients ranging from 0.53 to 0.80. Fifteen individuals
   (60\%) in the top 25 (by r5 index) list completed their fellowship at 1
   of these 7 institutions.
   CONCLUSIONS Approximately 90\% of fellowship-trained pediatric
   neurosurgeons have 1 or more publications, but the spectrum of output is
   broad. There is a strong correlation between where surgeons complete
   their fellowships and postgraduate publications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper makes an evaluation and comparison of influence on
   international Open Access (OA) between China and USA. First, Chinese and
   American OA journals are taken as an example. Second, combining
   traditional citation indicators with altmetrics indicators, a process of
   influence evaluation and comparison model on Chinese and American OA
   journals is constructed. Third, an evaluation indicator system of OA
   journals from two dimensions of academic influence and societal
   influence is constructed too. Lastly, through normalization, correlation
   analysis, reliability analysis, validity analysis, factor analysis and
   two-dimensional analysis, the academic and societal influence of OA
   journals are evaluated and compared between China and USA. It is found
   that in terms of academic influence and societal influence, the
   evaluation scores of international OA journals are quite different
   between China and USA. The influence of the USA is far greater than that
   of China. The results show a strong positive correlation among the 7
   traditional citation indicators based on JCR, and a high positive
   correlation among the 8 altmetrics indicators based on Altmetrics
   Explorer, and the indicators have a significant consistency both overall
   and internal. There is a highly positive correlation between academic
   influence and societal influence scores for the Chinese and American OA
   journals. Overall, the results confirm that the evaluation of societal
   influence of OA journals is used as supplement to the evaluation of
   academic influence. Altmetrics is also a powerful tool to measure the
   societal influence of OA journals, but it cannot replace the traditional
   citation indicators at present.}},

Abstract = {{Mendeley reader counts are a good source of early impact evidence for
   the life and natural sciences articles because they are abundant, appear
   before citations, and correlate moderately or strongly with citations in
   the long term. Early studies have found less promising results for the
   humanities and this article assesses whether the situation has now
   changed. Using Mendeley reader counts for articles in 12 arts and
   humanities Scopus subcategories, the results show that Mendeley reader
   counts reflect Scopus citation counts in most arts and humanities as
   strongly as in other areas of scholarship. Thus, Mendeley can be used as
   an early citation impact indicator in the arts and humanities, although
   it is unclear whether reader or citation counts reflect the underlying
   value of arts and humanities research.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Since the development of web 2.0, there has been a paradigm
   shift in methods of knowledge sharing. This has equally impacted on
   techniques of research evaluation. Many scholars have argued that the
   social utilization of research is hardly reflected in the traditional
   methods of research evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to
   determine the research impact of Library and Information Science (LIS)
   journals using Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) and
   then examine whether there is a correlation between their citations and
   altmetric attentions. Design/methodology/approach This paper is an
   attempt to contribute to this discussion with focus on the field of LIS.
   This paper adopted descriptive informatics to analyze LIS journals. The
   paper extracted citation data from WoS, Scopus and GS, and altmetric
   attentions from 85 LIS journals indexed by WoS. Further, 18 journals
   with high altmetric attention were identified, while 9 of these
   maintained consistent presence in the three databases used. Findings
   Findings show that of these databases, citation data from GS was found
   to have a high correlation with altmetric attention, while the other two
   databases maintained moderate correlations with altmetric attention. The
   paper also found a positive but non-significant correlation between
   citation scores and altmetric attention in the nine journals that
   maintained consistent presence in the three databases. Practical
   implications - The findings of this paper will be useful to librarians
   in selection of relevant journals for their libraries and also will
   assist authors in the choice of publication outlets for their papers
   particularly when considering journals that have visibility and research
   impact. Originality/value The originality of the paper lies on empirical
   evidences from the citation and altmetric data extracted from the
   databases used for the paper.}},

Title = {{Citation.js: a format-independent, modular bibliography tool for the
   browser and command line}},
Journal = {{PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background. Given the vast number of standards and formats for
   bibliographical data, any program working with bibliographies and
   citations has to be able to interpret such data. This paper describes
   the development of Citation.js (https://citation.js.org/), a tool to
   parse and format according to those standards. The program follows
   modern guidelines for software in general and JavaScript in specific,
   such as version control, source code analysis, integration testing and
   semantic versioning.
   Results. The result is an extensible tool that has already seen adaption
   in a variety of sources and use cases: as part of a server-side page
   generator of a publishing platform, as part of a local extensible
   document generator, and as part of an in-browser converter of extracted
   references. Use cases range from transforming a list of DOIs or Wikidata
   identifiers into a BibTeX file on the command line, to displaying RIS
   references on a webpage with added Altmetric badges to generating `'How
   to cite this'' sections on a blog. The accuracy of conversions is
   currently 27\% for properties and 60\% for types on average and a
   typical initialization takes 120 ms in browsers and 1 s with Node. js on
   the command line.
   Conclusions. Citation. js is a library supporting various formats of
   bibliographic information in a broad selection of use cases and
   environments. Given the support for plugins, more formats can be added
   with relative ease.}},

Abstract = {{How research impact is defined and evaluated is much-debated at research
   policy level. Offering one avenue for capturing societal research
   impact, altmetrics are proposed as quantitative indicators providing a
   measure of the reach and attention that a research output, such as a
   peer-eviewed paper, is receiving online. Eighty publicly-funded food
   researchers participated in an online mixed-methods engagement study.
   The analytical framework of sensemaking was used to explore
   participants' views of altmetrics as a threat or opportunity for their
   perceived professional identities. The identities important to our
   participants included ensuring rigour and quality in knowledge
   production; communicating and engaging with non-academic audiences; and
   bringing about tangible and meaningful changes in society. While an
   appetite for changes to research evaluation was apparent in our study,
   altmetrics was perceived to introduce a number of different threats as
   well as opportunities to the academic identity, which will influence its
   potential uptake and use.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Citation counts of articles have been used to measure
   scientific outcomes and assess suitability for grant applications.
   However, citation counts are not without limitations. With the rise of
   social media, altmetric scores may provide an alternative assessment
   tool.
   Objectives The aims of the study were to assess the characteristics of
   highly cited articles in medical professionalism and their altmetric
   scores.
   Methods The Web of Science was searched for top-cited articles in
   medical professionalism, and the characteristics of each article were
   identified. The altmetric database was searched to identify report for
   each identified article. A model to assess the relationship between the
   number of citations and each of the key characteristics as well as
   altmetric scores was developed.
   Results No correlations were found between the number of citations and
   number of years since publication (p=0.192), number of institutes
   (p=0.081), number of authors (p=0.270), females in authorship (p=0.150)
   or number of grants (p=0.384). The altmetric scores varied from 0 to
   155, total=806, median=5.0, (IQR=20). Twitter (54\%) and Mendeley (62\%)
   were the most popular altmetric resources. No correlation was found
   between the number of citations and the altmetric scores (p=0.661).
   However, a correlation was found for articles published in 2007 and
   after (n=17, p=0.023). To further assess these variables, a model was
   developed using multivariate analysis; did not show significant
   differences across subgroups. The topics covered were learning and
   teaching professionalism, curriculum issues, professional and
   unprofessional behaviour.
   Conclusions Altmetric scores of articles were significantly correlated
   with citations counts for articles published in 2007 and after. Highly
   cited articles were produced mainly by the USA, Canada and the UK. The
   study reflects the emerging role of social media in research
   dissemination. Future studies should investigate the specific features
   of highly cited articles and factors reinforcing distribution of
   research data among scholars and non-scholars.}},

Abstract = {{As the online dissemination of scholarly outputs gets faster and easier,
   altmetrics, social media based indices, have emerged alongside
   traditional metrics for research evaluation. In a two-phase survey, we
   investigate scholars' familiarity and usage of traditional metrics and
   altmetrics. In this paper, we present the second phase with 448
   participants. We found few traditional metrics, like the Journal Impact
   Factor and number of citations, are familiar to and often used by
   scholars for research evaluation. Among altmetrics, only
   views/downloads, readers, and followers are known to more than half the
   respondents. Unseen benefits and lack of time are hindrances to using
   metrics for the evaluation of research outputs. Although social media
   are well-known, scholars prefer promoting their research by publishing
   in journals and attending conferences. We found social media usage,
   perceived ease of use and usefulness of altmetrics affect the usage of
   altmetrics. Findings suggest altmetrics have attracted attention in
   academia and could be considered complementary to traditional metrics.
   We acknowledge that due to the limited sample size, statistics and
   demographics in this study, findings cannot be said to be representative
   of the entire academic population worldwide. Future studies are needed
   that cover a wider range of academic disciplines around the world.}},

Abstract = {{Twitter altmetrics has been proposed to measure the popularity and the
   potential societal impact of scientific products, but scientific
   tweeters who produce the Twitter altmetrics data have not been well
   explored. The study, by analyzing 2.63 million scientific tweeters' data
   that are extracted from the Altmetric.com company dataset, is aimed to
   reveal their productivity and geographic distribution in a comprehensive
   way. To gain a more in-depth understanding of their account types and
   identities, 1468 scientific tweeters of different levels of activeness
   are sampled for further analysis. Our results show that: (1) The extent
   to which a small proportion of tweeters have posted most of scientific
   tweets increases over time. In 2016, 10\% of scientific tweeters have
   posted 80\% of scientific tweets; (2) Scientific tweeters are widely
   distributed around the world but in a different pattern with the
   distribution of general Twitter users. In addition, scientific tweeters
   are found to be more active in tweeting scientific products than
   retweeting them in certain areas. (3) Manual coding of the sampled
   tweeters shows that the percentage of bot accounts among scientific
   tweeters is 1.8\%, which is much lower than that among general Twitter
   users. Moreover, 73\% of scientific tweeters use Twitter for
   professional purpose, 76\% use real names for their accounts, and 16\%
   are institutional accounts. (4) Identities of scientific tweeters are
   diversified. 49\% of them are researchers among which university faculty
   is the major type, and 38\% of them are the general public. With these
   results we suggest number of scientific tweets is not a good indicator
   of measuring either popularity or impact, tweeter's productivity,
   location and identities must be taken into consideration in interpreting
   the meaning of Twitter altmetrics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Social attention and scientific articles on stroke: Altmetric analysis
   of top-50 articles}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{183}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: It is well known that social media influences politics and
   the economy. A new Web-based metric (Altmetrics) has recently been
   developed for use in scientific fields. The aim of this study was to
   determine which recent papers in the field of stroke have received the
   greatest amount of attention from the general public. The Altmetric
   Attention Score is an automatically calculated metric for monitoring
   social media.
   Patients and methods: An Altmetric Explorer search was performed on May
   25, 2018 to extract the following information: (i) journal name, (ii)
   journal impact factor (IF), (iii) year of publication, (iv) article
   topic, (v) article type, and (vi) stroke subtype.
   Results: The journal that published articles that received the most
   attention on social media was Stroke (n = 16). Articles with higher IFs
   are not expected to receive greater attention on social media.
   Twenty-one of the identified articles related to the subtypes of
   ischemic stroke. Regarding contents, approximately half of the top-10
   ranked articles were about modifiable risk factors, especially diet and
   physical activities. Two recent articles on the extension of mechanical
   thrombectomy after 6 h were included on this list.
   Conclusions: There are some discrepancies in perspectives between
   scientific articles and general social media, and the Altmetric
   Attention Score is considered to more dynamically reflect the interests
   of the general public. We therefore suggest that physicians can use
   Altmetric analysis to identify what the general public actually wants to
   know about in the real world, while they should also have a critical
   view of the social media that attracts the public with a stimulating
   theme rather than a worthy subject.}},

Abstract = {{Academic social networking sites are important communication tools
   commonly used by scholars. In order to obtain an understanding of how
   scholars at US higher education institutions utilize these sites, this
   study took ResearchGate (RG) as an example and collected data from
   168,059 users from 61 US higher education institutions at three research
   activity levels as defined by the Carnegie Classification. A
   hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted, and four clusters of
   institutions with different behavior patterns were observed. The results
   indicate that US higher education institutions play different roles
   based on their academic influence in the network and demonstrate
   distinct behaviors in overall participation, information seeking, and
   information sharing. Users from universities of higher academic
   influence exhibited a preponderance for presentation behavior and were
   popular in the network, while scholars at moderate research-level
   institutions were active in seeking behavior as well as
   self-improvement. However, those at lower levels were comparatively
   inactive. The hierarchical clustering result also suggests that user
   behavior on this academic social networking site reflects the academic
   research activity level and level of academic influence accurately and
   effectively. These findings show a positive correlation between levels
   of scholarly output and utilization of academic social networking sites.
   This study also contributes to the ongoing efforts in understanding the
   scholarly use of academic social networking sites, and to the debate on
   whether associated alternative metrics (altmetrics) serve as
   supplementary evaluation measures of scholarship in higher education.
   The practical implications of the study are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The number of articles that researchers must be familiar with
   is increasing, along with the importance of selective searching and
   summarization. This study aimed to assess and characterize the most
   influential articles in Helicobacter pylori research. Methods We
   performed a search of the top-100 cited articles using the Web of
   Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and Google Scholar from their inception
   to 2018. The top-100 Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) articles based on
   online media mentions were also searched using the term H pylori. Each
   article was evaluated for the following characteristics: citation
   number, title, journal, publication year, and authorship. Results The
   citation number for the top-100 WoSCC articles ranged from 44 to 367.
   Gut published the largest number of articles (11\%). In the top-100
   Google Scholar articles, Lancet had the largest number of articles
   (13\%); however, among the top-1000 cited articles published after 2012,
   Helicobacter published the largest number (46\%). The largest number of
   top-100 AAS articles was published by PLOS Pathogens (6\%). PubMed
   Central articles' citations in WoSCC or Google Scholar showed
   significant correlation with those from each metric; however, AAS showed
   no correlation. The proportion of basic research was 36\%-37\% in
   top-cited articles; but, 52\% in the top-100 AAS articles. No time trend
   in the number of publications or citations of basic/clinical research in
   the top-100 bibliometrics was found. ``Meta-analysis/systematic
   review,{''} ``gastric cancer,{''} ``eradication,{''} and
   ``association{''} were the most influential title words. Conclusion This
   study presents a detailed list of top-100 articles, journals, authors,
   and topic title words.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{27}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The Open Access Initiative is gaining momentum due to the worldwide
   availability of advanced digital tools, online publishing platforms, and
   systems for tracking academic contributions. Several declarations and
   initiatives, including Plan S, have already laid a foundation for moving
   away from subscription to full and immediate open-access publishing. The
   global initiatives imply targeting journals satisfying the upgraded
   quality and visibility criteria. To meet these criteria, a comprehensive
   approach to Open Access is recommended. This article overviews the
   essential components of the comprehensive approach, increasing
   transparency, adherence to ethical standards, and diversification of
   evaluation metrics. With the increasing volume of quality open-access
   journals, their indexing with free databases and search engines is
   becoming increasingly important. The Directory of Open Access Journals
   and PubMed Central currently free searches of open-access sources. These
   services, however, cannot fully satisfy the increasing demands of the
   users, and attempts are underway to upgrade the indexing and archiving
   of open-access sources in China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and elsewhere.
   The wide use of identifiers is essential for transparency of scholarly
   communications. Peer reviewers are now offered credits from Publons.
   These credits are transferrable to their Open Researcher and Contributor
   ills. Various social media channels are increasingly used by scholars to
   comment on articles. All these comments are tracked by related metric
   systems, such as Altmetrics. Combined with traditional citation
   evaluations, the alternative metrics can help timely identify and
   promote publications influencing education, research, and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze the use of Google
   Scholar Citations' profiling platform by library and information science
   (LIS) scholars in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach Purposive
   sampling was used to collect Google Scholar Citations profiles between
   15 November 2017 and 31 January 2018. Resultant data were analyzed in
   SPSS Version 21. Findings In terms of demographical data, the study
   results were consistent with previous studies of Pakistani LIS scholars.
   There were strong correlations between Google Scholar Citations metrics
   (publications, citations, h-index and i10-index). The results indicate
   that, compared with a 2011 survey of LIS academics in Pakistan, the
   overall uptake for this cohort remains relatively low. This cohort is
   not maximizing the opportunity provided by this specific online
   profiling system to increase research visibility. Research
   limitations/implications - As the study was limited to those Pakistani
   LIS scholars who already had a profile on ResearchGate, it would be
   useful to broaden the research to encompass all Pakistani LIS scholars.
   Practical implications - The role of the librarian as an adviser in
   scholarly communication and impact can be extended to support scholars
   in the adoption of new online platforms for scholarly communication and
   visibility. Originality/value There have been no published research
   studies on Google Scholar Citations metrics in the context of Pakistani
   LIS scholars as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aims to assess highly cited articles using altmetrics
   and citations and identify the relationship between them. The
   statistical population consists of all the highly cited articles on
   surgery indexed on the Web of Science. The number of article citations
   was measured using the Web of Science and the altmetric score of the
   articles using the Altmetric Bookmarklet. The analysis of the data was
   carried out using descriptive statistics and Spearman's correlation
   coefficient. Of the 1077 highly cited surgery articles, 62.74 per cent
   had an altmetric score. The highest number of received citations was
   1787, and the highest altmetric score was 2019. A positive and
   significant correlation was observed between the number of citations and
   the policy-making documents, Wikipedia citations and CiteULike
   (P<0.001). A positive but non-significant correlation was also observed
   between the number of citations and the number of Mendeley readers
   (r=0.02, P>0.05). A poor, negative and significant correlations were
   observed between the number of citations and the overall altmetric score
   of the highly cited surgery articles (r=-0.235, P<0.001). The findings
   may be due to the different pattern of using social media by the surgery
   researchers compared to the researchers of other fields. Altmetrics can
   only be used to complement citations and not replace them.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been a surge of interest in new data emerged due to
   the rapid development of the information technologies in scholarly
   communication. Since the 2010s, altmetrics has become a common trend in
   scientometric research. However, researchers have not treated in much
   detail the question of the probability distributions underlying these
   new data. The principal objective of this study was to investigate one
   of the classic problems of scientometrics-the problem of citation and
   readership distributions. The study is based on the data obtained from
   two information systems: Web of Science and Mendeley. Here we based on
   the concept of the cumulative empirical distribution function to explore
   the differences and similarities between citations and readership counts
   of biological journals indexed in Web of Science and Mendeley. The basic
   idea was to determine, for any journal, a ``size{''} (it is said to be
   the topological rank) of citation and readership empirical cumulative
   distributions, and then to compare distributions of the topological
   ranks of Web of Science and Mendeley. In order to verify our model, we
   employ it to the bibliometric and altmetric research of 305-biological
   journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports 2015. The findings show
   that both distributions of the topological rank of biological journals
   are statistically close to the Wakeby distribution. The findings
   presented in this study add to our understanding of information
   processes of the scholarly communication in the new digital environment.}},

Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{7-8}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Patterns and methods of scholarly communication have changed with the
   growth in information technology, particularly the Internet and the
   social web. The changes have necessitated a broader definition of
   scholarly communication and the role of social media in the research
   process. We sought to record the body of work that the Institute for
   Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS), a research institute at the
   University of the Western Cape, produced over a 20-year period
   (1995-2015) - the first two decades of its existence - and to measure
   its visibility and impact using bibliometrics and altmetrics. A survey
   was also carried out to investigate to what extent PLAAS researchers
   knew and used social media in their research practice. Scopus and Google
   Scholar were used as citation indices and Altmetric.com provided
   Altmetric scores - a measure of impact through social and mainstream
   media. The full list of PLAAS outputs showed a composition of 54\% grey
   literature and 46\% journal articles and monographs. Given that over
   half of PLAAS research outputs were in the form of grey literature, and
   therefore not indexed in traditional bibliometric databases, we suggest
   that alternative metrics be used in conjunction with bibliometrics, to
   measure the impact of a body of work on the scholarly domain. Although
   the bibliometrics in this study were a useful quantitative indicator of
   the impact of PLAAS research, this study was inconclusive with regard to
   determining the impact of the research output via altmetrics, partly
   because not any of the grey literature, nor any author from PLAAS, had a
   unique identifier, thus making it difficult to track and find
   quantitative indicators. Nonetheless, the potential benefit for PLAAS of
   using altmetrics was demonstrated in selected case studies of the output
   of three PLAAS researchers active on social media platforms.
   Significance:
   This study demonstrates that the use of bibliometric and altmetric
   analyses can yield a rich picture of research output and significance,
   providing insight into the patterns of scholarly communication of
   research and policy institutions.
   The application of the research design in other research units and
   departments could generate results that are useful to research
   management within those institutions.}},

   Methods: The anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to
   full-time researchers at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of
   Toronto. The survey included twenty questions inquiring about
   researchers' needs and behaviors across three stages of the research
   cycle: funding and grant applications, publication and dissemination,
   and research impact assessment. Data were also collected on researchers'
   use of grey literature to identify whether current library efforts to
   support researchers should be improved in this area.
   Results: Among library services, researchers considered support for
   funding and grant applications most valuable and grey literature support
   least valuable. Researcher engagement with open access publishing models
   was low, and few participants had self-archived their publications in
   the university's institutional repository. Participants reported low
   interest in altmetrics, and few used online tools to promote or share
   their research results.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased efforts should be made to
   promote and develop services for funding and grant applications. New
   services are needed to assist researchers in maximizing their research
   impact and to increase researcher awareness of the benefits of open
   access publishing models, self-archiving, and altmetrics.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal relationship between social media activity and article
   citations in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy}},
Journal = {{GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-83}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Social media activity in the area of scientific
   journal publications has increased significantly over the last decade.
   Several studies have suggested that journal article citations can be
   positively impacted by an increase in social media activity. Preliminary
   data have also suggested that published articles in the field of
   gastroenterology and hepatology that were discussed on Twitter were
   independently associated with higher citation rates compared with those
   that were not. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (GIE) is the most widely cited
   endoscopy-focused journal in the world. We aimed to assess the
   association of social media exposure of published articles in GIE and
   its impact on article citations.
   Methods: Data regarding journal article publication status, number of
   citations per article, and social media exposure per article using
   Altmetric data were collected from the publisher. All original articles
   published in GIE from 2000 to 2016 were reviewed. Editorials, case
   reports, and other nonresearch correspondence were excluded.
   Multivariable linear regression was used to assess for independent
   Altmetric predictors of higher citation rates over time. Logistic
   regression was used to assess the impact of an article mention on
   various social media platforms and whether it was cited during the study
   period.
   Results: A total of 2361 original research articles were evaluated; 2050
   articles (86.8\%) were cited at least once during the follow-up period.
   Mean number of citations per article was 16.8 +/- 23. The average
   Altmetric Attention score was 2.0 +/- 13. The most profound independent
   predictor of article citation was whether an article was tweeted (odds
   ratio {[}OR], 14.2; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 8.93-22.45). Other
   predictors were Facebook posts (OR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.51) and number
   of Mendeley readers (OR, 1.359; 95\% CI, 1.28-1.45). On multivariable
   linear regression, number of tweeters (beta = 2.3, P = .022), F1000
   reviews (beta = 5.87, P < .001), policy documents (beta = 7.6, P <
   .001), and number of Mendeley readers (beta = 14.21, P < .001) were
   significantly associated with higher citation rates of published
   articles.
   Conclusions: For original articles published in GIE, there was a strong
   association between social media exposure on Twitter and rates of
   journal article citations. To a lesser degree, Facebook posts and
   Mendeley readers also were associated with a higher rate of article
   citations. This could represent both cause and effect and may be
   representative of higher quality articles being more commonly mentioned
   on social media by third-party users. A randomized controlled study
   evaluating different degrees of social media exposure on individual
   articles could be considered to further assess for causality.}},

Abstract = {{Using the idea of a digitally based, constructed, and virtual researcher
   self, we explore ways in which social media, social network sites, and
   social networking present researcher self(ves) and research product(s)
   to a range of interested others. We argue that in a climate where
   visibility of, and attention for, both research and researchers is
   paramount, we are seeing the resilience and morphing of metrics and all
   they represent into new and different forms driven by possibilities
   afforded by social media and social networking. This poses new forms of
   old problems for qualitative inquiry and qualitative inquirers. However,
   at the same time, used with care, social media and social networking may
   open up possibilities for qualitative research to be seen and heard, and
   better reach those for whom our research is of interest and use. Central
   questions underpinning the discussion are: How can we use, rather than
   be used by, the possibilities afforded to our research and researcher
   selves by social media and social networking? If we cannot always
   control how our researcher self is presented in social media and social
   networking sites, how might we resist the researcher self being
   assembled for us by others such as by their use of altmetrics?
   Crucially, how can we make sure that qualitative inquiry and expertise
   is the focus, rather than the gaining of attention, thus avoiding the
   proliferation of a type of Kardashian qualitative inquiry-related
   trendsetter and opinion maker based more on ability to gain attention
   than expertise in qualitative inquiry.}},

Abstract = {{Social networking sites play a significant role in altmetrics. While
   90\% of all altmetric mentions come from Twitter, the known microscopic
   and macroscopic properties of Twitter altmetrics data are limited. In
   this study, we present a large-scale analysis of Twitter altmetrics data
   using social network analysis techniques on the mention' network of
   Twitter users. Exploiting the network-level properties of over 1.4
   million tweets, corresponding to 77,757 scholarly articles, this study
   focuses on the following aspects of Twitter altmetrics data: (a) the
   influence of organizational accounts; (b) the formation of disciplinary
   communities; (c) the cross-disciplinary interaction among Twitter users;
   (d) the network motifs of influential Twitter users; and (e) testing the
   small-world property. The results show that Twitter-based social media
   communities have unique characteristics, which may affect social media
   usage counts either directly or indirectly. Therefore, instead of
   treating altmetrics data as a black box, the underlying social media
   networks, which may either inflate or deflate social media usage counts,
   need further scrutiny.}},

Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective To characterise how online media coverage of journal articles
   on cancer funded by the US government varies by cancer type and stage of
   the cancer control continuum and to compare the disease prevalence rates
   with the amount of funded research published for each cancer type and
   with the amount of media attention each receives.
   Design A cross-sectional study.
   Setting The United States.
   Participants The subject of analysis was 11 436 journal articles on
   cancer funded by the US government published in 2016. These articles
   were identified via PubMed and characterised as receiving online media
   attention based on data provided by Altmetric.
   Results 16.8\% (n=1925) of articles published on US government-funded
   research were covered in the media. Published journal articles addressed
   all common cancers. Frequency of journal articles differed substantially
   across the common cancers, with breast cancer (n=1284), lung cancer
   (n=630) and prostate cancer (n=586) being the subject of the most
   journal articles. Roughly one-fifth to one-fourth of journal articles
   within each cancer category received online media attention. Media
   mentions were disproportionate to actual burden of each cancer type (ie,
   incidence and mortality), with breast cancer articles receiving the most
   media mentions. Scientific articles also covered the stages of the
   cancer continuum to varying degrees. Across the 13 most common cancer
   types, 4.4\% (n=206) of articles focused on prevention and control,
   11.7\% (n=550) on diagnosis and 10.7\% (n=502) on therapy.
   Conclusions Findings revealed a mismatch between prevalent cancers and
   cancers highlighted in online media. Further, journal articles on cancer
   control and prevention received less media attention than other cancer
   continuum stages. Media mentions were not proportional to actual public
   cancer burden nor volume of scientific publications in each cancer
   category. Results highlight a need for continued research on the role of
   media, especially online media, in research dissemination.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To increase awareness, search for solutions, and drive
   change, disparity-related research needs to be strategically
   disseminated. This study aimed to quantify whether a social media
   strategy could: (1) amplify dissemination of gender equity-related
   articles and (2) collect proposed solutions to gender equity issues.
   Methods: In April 2018, eight published journal articles covering
   separate gender equity issues were presented in a 1-hour Twitter chat
   hosted by Physician's Weekly. Metrics data were collected before,
   during, and after the chat. During the chat, one question related to
   each article was tweeted at a time. Qualitative data were extracted from
   responses and evaluated for thematic content.
   Results: In the 16-hour period during and following the chat, we tallied
   1500 tweets from 294 participants and 8.6 million impressions (potential
   views). The Altmetric Attention Score of each article increased
   (average, 126.5 points; range, 91-208 points). Within the respective
   journal, the Altmetric Rank of seven articles improved (range, 3 to >=
   19), while the eighth maintained its \# 1 rank. The one article for
   which share and download data were available experienced a 729\%
   increase in shares following prechat posts and another 113\% bump after
   the chat, a 1667\% increase overall (n = 45-795). Similarly, downloads,
   and presumably reads, increased 712\% following prechat posts and
   another 47\% bump after the chat, a 1093\% increase overall (n =
   394-4700). We tallied 181 potential solutions to the eight gender
   equity-related questions.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that social media can be used
   strategically to increase the dissemination of research articles and
   collect solution-focused feedback.}},

Title = {{Cochrane overviews: how can we optimize their impact on evidence-based
   rehabilitation?}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL AND REHABILITATION MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{395-410}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Overviews (i.e. reviews of multiple systematic reviews)
   comprise a relatively novel methodology to systematically synthesize
   research findings. Overviews aim for a beneficial impact on clinical
   practice, but their methods and pathways to impact have so far not been
   mapped. The aim of this paper was to inform recommendations for
   optimizing impact on rehabilitation practice and research by mapping
   methods and pathways to impact in Cochrane overviews relevant to
   rehabilitation.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically searched and identified
   published Cochrane overviews (to June 2018) relevant to rehabilitation.
   We extracted data and compared overviews on key characteristics, methods
   of evidence synthesis, statements about impact, and access metrics. We
   explored one overview in detail regarding beneficiaries, activities and
   outputs, mapped potential pathways to impact, and, using an iterative
   process, refined this into a generic map. Through exploration of all
   synthesized data, we propose further recommendations for planning,
   conducting and reporting of future overviews in order to optimize impact
   on rehabilitation.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified seven Cochrane overviews relevant to
   rehabilitation. Their focus and methods varied, but they were broadly
   related to rehabilitation interventions for populations of people with
   diverse long-term conditions. Overviews also varied regarding their
   intended impact; only 4 overviews identified specific beneficiaries. All
   overviews included multiple tables and figures, but only one synthesized
   key findings into a single figure. For five overviews, the Altmetric
   Attention Score (a weighted count of attention that an output receives
   based on a range of online sources) was in the top 5\% of all research
   outputs scored by Altmetric. The overview within our worked example had
   four key impact goals, each with different beneficiaries and required
   actions; this example led to a generic map of potential pathways to
   impact for other overviews.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cochrane overviews have the potential to play a key role in
   knowledge translation and therefore to be useful in supporting
   evidence-based rehabilitation practice. However, current overviews
   relating to rehabilitation differ in methods, approaches and intended
   impact, and sometimes fall short of promoting easy access to key
   information for beneficiaries. Future Cochrane overviews should address
   topics of importance to key beneficiaries and clearly outline potential
   pathways to impact in order to have a potential beneficial impact on
   evidence-based rehabilitation and to improve rehabilitation outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The multidimensional nature of digital libraries evaluation domain poses
   several challenges to the research communities that intend to assess
   criteria, methods, products and tools, and also practice them. The
   amount of scientific production that is published in the domain hinders
   and disorientates the interested researchers. These researchers need
   guidance to exploit effectively the considerable amount of data and the
   diversity of methods, as well as to identify new research goals and
   develop their plans for future studies. This paper proposes a
   methodological pathway to investigate the core topics that structure the
   digital library evaluation domain and their impact. Further to the
   exploration of these topical entities, this study investigates also the
   researchers that contribute substantially to key topics, their
   communities and their relationships. The proposed methodology exploits
   topic modeling and network analysis in combination with citation and
   altmetrics analysis on a corpus consisting of the digital library
   evaluation papers presented in JCDL, ECDL/TDPL and ICADL conferences in
   the period 2001-2013.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetrics indices are increasingly applied to measure scholarly
   influence in recent years because they can reflect the influence of
   research outputs more timely comparing with traditional measurements.
   Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI), as an emerging
   interdiscipline, has a rapid development in these years. Traditional
   indices can't reflect the influence of the AI research outputs quickly,
   thus more timely altmetrics indices are needed. In this paper, we
   conduct four studies about altmetrics indices and AI research outputs
   based on the datasets collected from Altmetric.com and Scopus database.
   First, we provide a review of the research status in the AI field.
   Second, we show the AI researches that attracted the most attention.
   Third, we demonstrate the general effectiveness of altmetrics indices in
   the AI field. Last, we examine the effectiveness of altmetrics indices
   for different levels of AI journal papers and AI conference papers. Our
   results indicate that there is a rapid increase of AI publications and
   the public has paid more attention to AI research outputs since 2011. It
   is found that altmetrics indices are effective to discriminate highly
   cited publications and publications whose citation counts increase
   quickly. Among all Altmetric sub-indicators, Number of Mendeley readers
   is the most effective. Moreover, the results indicate that altmetrics
   indices are more effective in high levels of AI journal papers and AI
   conference papers. The main contribution of this paper is investigating
   the effectiveness of altmetrics indices from the perspective of
   different levels of publications. This study lays the foundation for
   further investigations about effectiveness of altmetrics indices from
   new perspectives, and it has important implication for the studies about
   the impact of social media on the scientific community.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we made a survey on the prediction capability of

   articles by establishing a machine learning framework. Twenty-three
   bibliometric and alternative indices were collected to establish the
   feature space for the predication task. In order to eliminate the
   possible redundancy in feature space, three feature selection techniques
   of Relief-F, principal component analysis and entropy weighted method
   were used to rank the features according to their contribution to the
   original data set. Combining the fractal dimension of the data set, the
   intrinsic features which can better represent the original feature space
   were extracted. Three classifiers of Naive Bayes, KNN and random forest
   were performed to detect the classification performance of these
   features. Experimental results show that both bibliometric indices and
   alternative metrics are beneficial to articles' growth. Early citation
   features, early Web usage statistics, as well as the reputation of the
   first author are the most valuable indicators in making an article more
   influential in the future.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we addressed the question of whether a video abstract of
   an article affects its citation counts. A retrospective cohort study was
   conducted using the research articles published in New Journal of
   Physics during 2010 and 2016. Articles with video abstract (N=315) as
   the experimental group, were matched 1:2, with articles without video
   abstract (N=630) as the control group, by the same publishing issue,
   same article type. Specifically, the articles lacking video abstract
   that appeared immediately before and after each experimental group
   article were included in the control group. A negative binomial
   regression model was employed to analyze the data. After controlling for
   the characteristics of articles (including the number of authors,
   international co-authorship, character counts of title, character counts
   of text-based abstract, keyword counts, reference counts, page counts
   and funding), our results showed that articles with video abstract
   (experimental group) compared to the articles without video abstract
   (control group) were expected to have a rate 1.206 times greater for
   citation counts. This study suggests that a video abstract can
   potentially serve as a useful genre of a research article for receiving
   more citation counts.}},

Title = {{Towards a second generation of `social media metrics': Characterizing
   Twitter communities of attention around science}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{`Social media metrics' are bursting into science studies as emerging new
   measures of impact related to scholarly activities. However, their
   meaning and scope as scholarly metrics is still far from being grasped.
   This research seeks to shift focus from the consideration of social
   media metrics around science as mere indicators confined to the analysis
   of the use and visibility of publications on social media to their
   consideration as metrics of interaction and circulation of scientific
   knowledge across different communities of attention, and particularly as
   metrics that can also be used to characterize these communities.
   Although recent research efforts have proposed tentative typologies of
   social media users, no study has empirically examined the full range of
   Twitter user's behavior within Twitter and disclosed the latent
   dimensions in which activity on Twitter around science can be
   classified. To do so, we draw on the overall activity of social media
   users on Twitter interacting with research objects collected from the
   Altmetic.com database. Data from over 1.3 million unique users,
   accounting for over 14 million tweets to scientific publications, is
   analyzed. Based on an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, four
   latent dimensions are identified: `Science Engagement', `Social Media
   Capital', `Social Media Activity' and Science Focus'. Evidence on the
   predominant type of users by each of the four dimensions is provided by
   means of VOSviewer term maps of Twitter profile descriptions. This
   research breaks new ground for the systematic analysis and
   characterization of social media users' activity around science.}},

Title = {{Analysis of highly tweeted dental journals and articles: a science

Abstract = {{Aim We aimed to rank dental journals according to the number of Twitter
   mentions related to their articles. We set out to analyse and visualise
   the bibliometric characteristics of highly tweeted articles.
   Methods Twitter mentions were extracted from the Altmetric database.
   Bibliometric data were obtained from the Web of Science and analysed by
   VOSviewer software. Hotspots among highly tweeted articles visualised by
   keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Bibliographic coupling network
   analysis was used to find the most influential journals, institutions
   and countries.
   Results A total of 20,520 Twitter accounts which shared 93,776 tweets
   related to 23,686 articles from 91 journals were analysed. The British
   Dental Journal had the highest number of Twitter mentions related to
   dental articles. Children, dental caries, and periodontal disease were
   the hottest topics among the 134 highly tweeted dental articles.
   @The\_BDJ had the highest number of tweets related to dental articles,
   followed by @Dddent2 and @gary\_takacs. @The BDA had the highest number
   of followers, followed by @Dddent2 and @The\_BDJ.
   Discussion Ground breaking issues such as genomic medicine, stem cells,
   tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence were not
   seen among the highly tweeted dental articles. In the `Twittersphere',
   some independent scientists are more active than well-known dental
   organisations and journals. The journals are strongly recommended to be
   proactive in Twittersphere, to set up their own Twitter profile, and to
   promote their visibility and social impact by immediately tweeting the
   articles. Researchers should be alert to the overuse of Twitter in
   scholarly communications. The Kardashian index will be a useful tool to
   measure the over/under activity of a researcher on Twitter.}},

Title = {{Computer Science in ASEAN: A Ten-Year Bibliometric Analysis (2009-2018)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{The growth of a country is heavily depending on its investment over
   science and technology. In fact, the progress in computer science
   research serves as a vital factor in the development of a country.
   Interestingly, despite that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
   (ASEAN) is located near each other, they do not share a similar level of
   ICT development, which leads to a digital divide among them. Thus, it is
   crucial to bibliometrically evaluate and compare the computer science
   research output over the latest decade (i.e., 2009 to 2018) among these
   countries. With the data gathered from the Web of Science, this study
   seeks to uncover the research focus of all ASEAN countries over the
   latest decade by analyzing the author keywords. Majority of the ASEAN
   was having a different research focus, explaining the varied levels of
   ICT development. Practical and theoretical implications are then offered
   accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Background Alternative metrics (Altmetrics) based on mentions in online
   media is a new tool that can help identify articles that have the most
   influence on diverse public audiences. Purpose To determine the 100 most
   mentioned articles in the field of neuroimaging and to analyze their
   characteristics. Material and Methods We selected the 668 journals that
   were considered to potentially publish neuroimaging articles. Using the
   Altmetric.com search tool, we identified the 100 most mentioned
   neuroimaging articles based on the highest Altmetric Attention Scores
   (AAS) within selected journals. Each article was evaluated for several
   characteristics including AAS, number of citations, journal title,
   impact factor of journal, year of publication, authorship, country, type
   of document, disease entity, and imaging technique. Results The AAS for
   the top 100 articles were in the range of 145-1467. Frontiers in Human
   Neuroscience published the largest number of articles (n = 9), followed
   by Radiology (n = 8) and Neurology (n = 8). All articles were published
   during 2006-2018, with 56\% of articles being published in 2016-2018.
   The majority of articles originated from the United States (n = 56),
   were original articles (n = 81), covered normal population (n = 67), and
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 56). Sasaki was the most
   prolific, authoring three of the most mentioned neuroimaging articles.
   Conclusion This study presents a detailed list of the 100 most mentioned

Abstract = {{In the battle for better science, the research community must
   obliterate, at times, works from the publication record, a process known
   as retraction. Additionally, publications and papers accumulate an
   altmetric attention score, which is a complementary metric to
   citation-based metrics. We used the citations, Journal Impact Factor,
   time between publication and retraction and the reasons behind
   retraction in order to find determinants of the retracted papers
   altmetric attention score. To find these determinants we compared two
   samples, one of retractions with top altmetric attention scores and one
   of retractions with altmetric attention scores chosen at random. We used
   a binary choice model to estimate the probability of being retracted due
   to misconduct or error. The model shows positive effects of altmetric
   scores and the time between publication and retraction on the
   probability to be retracted due to misconduct in the top sample. We
   conclude that there is an association between retraction due to
   misconduct and higher altmetric attention scores within the top sample.}},

Abstract = {{Twitter accounts have already been used in many scientometric studies,
   but the meaningfulness of the data for societal impact measurements in
   research evaluation has been questioned. Earlier research focused on
   social media counts and neglected the interactive nature of the data. We
   explore a new network approach based on Twitter data in which we compare
   author keywords to hashtags as indicators of topics. We analyze the
   topics of tweeted publications and compare them with the topics of all
   publications (tweeted and not tweeted). Our exploratory study is based
   on a comprehensive publication set of climate change research. We are
   interested in whether Twitter data are able to reveal topics of public
   discussions which can be separated from research-focused topics. We find
   that the most tweeted topics regarding climate change research focus on
   the consequences of climate change for humans. Twitter users are
   interested in climate change publications which forecast effects of a
   changing climate on the environment and to adaptation, mitigation and
   management issues rather than in the methodology of climate-change
   research and causes of climate change. Our results indicate that
   publications using scientific jargon are less likely to be tweeted than
   publications using more general keywords. Twitter networks seem to be
   able to visualize public discussions about specific topics. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Altmetrics promise useful support for assessing the impact of scientific
   works, including beyond the scholarly community and with very limited
   citation windows. Unfortunately, altmetrics scores are currently
   available only for recent articles and cannot be used as covariates in
   predicting long term impact of publications. However, the study of their
   statistical properties is a subject of evident interest to
   scientometricians. Applying the same approaches used in the literature
   to assess the universality of citation distributions, the intention here
   is to test whether the universal distribution also holds for Mendeley
   readerships. Results of the analysis carried out on a sample of
   publications randomly extracted from the Web of Science confirm that
   readerships seem to share similar shapes across fields and can be
   rescaled to a common and universal form. Such rescaling results as not
   particularly effective on the right tails. In other regions, rescaling
   causes a good collapse of field specific distributions, even for very
   recent publications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures contribute to multiple diseases in
   children; yet, few pediatricians have training in pediatric
   environmental health (PEH), and few academic health centers have PEH
   expertise. To build national capacity in PEH, the Academic Pediatric
   Association (APA) launched a professional development program that since
   2002 has encouraged the establishment of post-residency/post-doctoral
   training programs, supported a special interest group, and convened an
   annual mentored retreat for PEH trainees.
   OBJECTIVE: Describe the APA's professional development program in PEH
   and assess its impact by tracking careers of former trainees.
   METHODS: Careers were tracked through interviews with trainees and
   program directors supplemented by searches of institutional websites.
   Publication listings were obtained through PubMed. Publication impact
   was assessed using bibliometric and altmetric measures. Grant histories
   were accessed through the National Institutes of Health RePORTER
   project. Information on advocacy work was obtained through interviews
   with program directors.
   RESULTS: Fifty-five trainees (36 physicians and 19 health scientists)
   completed PEH training and attended the APA retreat between 2002 and
   2017. Forty-one (75\%) are pursuing academic careers, 11 are associate
   or full professors, 11 are practicing general pediatrics or a pediatric
   subspecialty, 2 are Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
   epidemiologists, and 1 is a data scientist. Forty-two former trainees
   (76\%) listed ``environment{''} or ``environmental{''} in their job
   titles or on their websites. Former trainees have published 632
   scientific papers. These papers have been cited 3094 times, have a
   relative citation ratio of 2.97, and have been read or viewed 1,274,388
   times. Twenty-one former trainees have been awarded 43 National
   Institutes of Health grants. Trainees have developed education and
   advocacy skills by teaching medical students and residents, presenting
   grand rounds, preparing policy papers, presenting legislative testimony,
   and making presentations to public audiences.
   CONCLUSIONS: The APA's professional development program has contributed
   to the expansion of national capacity in PEH. Former trainees are
   populating the field, generating new knowledge, and moving into
   leadership positions.}},

Abstract = {{The social web appears a promising environment to study the societal
   impact of research, and, although platforms such as Twitter appear to be
   popular to share scientific content, little is known about the outreach
   of scientific communication on social media. By surveying a sample of
   Twitter users who are also followers of communication and Library and
   Information Science (LIS) researchers, this article aims to understand
   who is interacting with researchers on Twitter and if the activity of
   following allows to get closer to science and research. A survey was
   sent to all followers of 9 active researchers, and 53 responses were
   collected and analyzed. According to the results, followers are mostly
   professionals (49\%) although the higher education sector (36\%)
   accounts for an important part of the audience. Twitter allows
   respondents to keep updated, feel as a part of the scientific community
   and gain more visibility, whereas interactions appear as an important
   though secondary facet of these users' activity on Twitter. Finally,
   participants consider that they do not have influence on the scientific
   process, maybe because the flow of information on Twitter occurs mostly
   as retweeting in an unidirectional fashion. More research is needed in
   order to understand better interactions and engagement on social media
   before they can be quantified and measured as indicators of societal
   impact of research.}},

Abstract = {{This conceptual exploration revisits a key question from earlier work
   (Greenhow \& Gleason, 2014): What is scholarship reconsidered in the age
   of social media? Social scholarship is a framework that expanded Boyers'
   (1990) conceptualization of scholarship to consider how social media
   affect discovery and research, teaching and learning, integration, and
   application. This paper critically reflects on how social scholarship
   continues to evolve in light of changing understandings in the field of
   educational technology and the role social media play in the academy. We
   provide recent examples of social scholarship such as altmetrics,
   interdisciplinary projects, crowdsourced educational technology syllabi
   and reconsideration of the needs of research participants. Moreover, we
   share concrete examples of how scholars might enact social scholarship,
   with what benefits and challenges, and surface new concerns regarding
   openness, equity, access, literacy, privacy and ethical considerations.
   Our paper concludes with recommendations for preparing scholars to enact
   social scholarship while mitigating the challenges it poses.}},

   use of data of altmetric indicators from Online Social Networking
   services and databases related with reference management websites. The
   results show that the altmetric data still have a low level of adherence

   the factors involved, stand out the lack of identifiers in approximately
   eighty percent of the journals indexed by BRAPCI and the low level of
   mentions on publications into the Online Social Networks services. It is

Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{The advent of social media has enabled us to explore the impact of
   academic entities beyond the conventional bibliometric community. The
   traditional bibliometric indicators such as citation count, h-index and
   SNIP metrics aim to represent the propagation of knowledge in the
   academic world rather than the impact of the research on the wider
   world. In this study, we are interested in measuring the impact of the
   academic world on social media. We first create the 2-layered graph
   where the first layer is the bipartite graph between academic and social
   media entities and a second layer is the graph between social media
   entities. Then, we employed the heat diffusion-based metrics to measure
   the influence of academic entities in social media. Thus, we evaluate
   the academic entities by (1) predicting links between academic entities
   and social media and (2) suggesting memes for the academic entities. Our
   analysis on predicting links between scientist and social media entities

Abstract = {{Purpose Based on the data from Figshare repositories, the purpose of
   this paper is to analyze which research data are actively produced and
   shared in the interdisciplinary field of library and information science
   (LIS). Design/methodology/approach Co-occurrence analysis was performed
   on keywords assigned to research data in the field of LIS, which were
   archived in the Figshare repository. By analyzing the keyword network
   using the pathfinder algorithm, the study identifies key areas where
   data production is actively conducted in LIS, and examines how these
   results differ from the conventional intellectual structure of LIS based
   on co-citation or bibliographic coupling analysis. Findings Four major
   domains - Open Access, Scholarly Communication, Data Science and
   Informatics - and 15 sub-domains were created. The keywords with the
   highest global influence appeared as follows, in descending order:
   ``open access,{''} ``scholarly communication{''} and ``altmetrics.{''}
   Originality/value This is the first study to understand the key areas
   that actively produce and utilize data in the LIS field.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to map and identify topics of interest within the field
   of Microbiology and identify the main sources driving such attention. We
   combine data from Web of Science and Altmetric.com, a platform which
   retrieves mentions to scientific literature from social media and other
   non-academic communication outlets. We focus on the dissemination of
   microbial publications in Twitter, news media and policy briefs. A
   two-mode network of social accounts shows distinctive areas of activity.
   We identify a cluster of papers mentioned solely by regional news media.
   A central area of the network is formed by papers discussed by the three
   outlets. A large portion of the network is driven by Twitter activity.
   When analyzing top actors contributing to such network, we observe that
   more than half of the Twitter accounts are bots, mentioning 32\% of the
   documents in our dataset. Within news media outlets, there is a
   predominance of popular science outlets. With regard to policy briefs,
   both international and national bodies are represented. Finally, our
   topic analysis shows that the thematic focus of papers mentioned varies
   by outlet. While news media cover the wider range of topics, policy
   briefs are focused on translational medicine and bacterial outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between influential tweeters and highly cited articles
   in the field of information sciences was analysed using Twitter data
   gathered by Altmetric.com from July 2011 through February 2017. The
   dataset consists of more than 10,000 tweets, and these mentions,
   retweets and followers were used to generate a connected, undirected
   graph. This graph reveals the most influential tweeters by identifying
   the largest drop in the eigenvalue of adjacency or affinity matrix of a
   graph when certain nodes are removed; those which, when deleted, cause
   the greatest drop in the eigenvalue of the graph are considered to be
   the most influential. The machine-learning model applied in this work
   utilizes a feature vector containing the accumulated sum of the rank
   scores of those influential users who tweet a given article, along with
   known altmetric features such as the user type and post counts for
   various social media. Finally, the supervised-learning model was trained
   using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers with 11
   features, including the sum of the ranks of influential users who tweet
   a given article in our dataset. The results were analysed using Receiver
   Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Precision Recall (PR) curves,
   which give the commendable outcomescompared to thebaseline model. We
   found that, for the classification of highly cited articles, Twitter
   users' score for influence is the most important feature. Finally, we
   show that our modelwhich was trained bytaking the score for influence
   into considerationoutperforms the baseline, at 79\% for ROC and 90\% for
   PR with the Random Forest Model, effectively identifying the highly
   cited articles.}},

Abstract = {{Bibliometrics use statistical methods to measure the scholarly impact of

   alternative metrics. Conventional metrics have often been considered the
   standard to measure the impact of publication-related scholarship. With
   the growing popularity of social media and ease of instantaneous
   distribution of information globally, alternative metrics have become an
   important complementary measure of scholarly activity. Bibliometrics may
   provide a standard performance measurement that may be used for tenure
   and/or promotion among academic institutions. The alternative metric
   industry has shown considerable growth with increasingly improved
   algorithms working towards standardization. Together, conventional
   metrics and alternative metrics may synergistically complement each
   other to provide an accelerated translation from research to clinical
   care that may lead to tremendous benefits in patients. All physicians
   and other healthcare professionals should receive training in
   bibliometrics and understand the potential impact of professional social

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe Hirsch index, often used to assess research impact,
   suffers from questionable validity within the context of General
   Surgery, and consequently adapted bibliometrics and altmetrics have
   emerged, including the r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index. This
   study aimed to assess the relative value of these novel bibliometrics in
   a single UK Deanery General Surgical Consultant cohort.MethodFive
   indices (h, r, m, g and i10) and altmetric scores (AS) were calculated
   for 151 general surgical consultants in a UK Deanery. Indices and AS
   were calculated from publication data via the Scopus search engine with
   assessment of construct validity and reliability.ResultsThe median
   number of publications, h-index, r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index
   were 13 (range 0-389), 5 (range 0-63), 5.2 (range 0-64.8), 0.33 (range
   0-1.5), 10 (range 0-125) and 4 (range 0-245), respectively. Correlation
   coefficients of r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index with h-index
   were 0.913 (p<0.001), 0.716 (p<0.001), 0.961 (p<0.001) and 0.939
   (p<0.001), respectively. Significant variance was observed when the
   cohort was ranked by individual bibliometric measures; the median
   ranking shifts were: r-index -2 (-46 to +23); m-index -6.5 (-53 to +22);
   g-index -0.5 (-24 to +13); and i10-index 0 (-8 to +11), respectively
   (p<0.001). The median altmetric score and AS index were 0 (range
   0-225.5) and 1 (range 0-10), respectively; AS index correlated strongly
   with h-index (correlation coefficient 0.390, p<0.001).ConclusionsAdapted
   bibliometric indices appear to be equally valid measures of evaluating
   academic productivity, impact and reach.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, social media has become a potentially new way for scholarly
   journals to disseminate and evaluate research outputs. Scholarly
   journals have started promoting their research articles to a wide range
   of audiences via social media platforms. This article aims to
   investigate the social media presence of scholarly journals across
   disciplines. We extracted journals from Web of Science and searched for
   the social media presence of these journals on Facebook and Twitter.
   Relevant metrics and content relating to the journals' social media
   accounts were also crawled for data analysis. From our results, the
   social media presence of scholarly journals lies between 7.1\% and
   14.2\% across disciplines; and it has shown a steady increase in the
   last decade. The popularity of scholarly journals on social media is
   distinct across disciplines. Further, we investigated whether social
   media metrics of journals can predict the Journal Impact Factor (JIF).
   We found that the number of followers and disciplines have significant
   effects on the JIF. In addition, a word co-occurrence network analysis
   was also conducted to identify popular topics discussed by scholarly
   journals on social media platforms. Finally, we highlight challenges and
   issues faced in this study and discuss future research directions.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we test whether metrics of online attention describing
   research can provide information on research quality and societal impact
   that is not found in citation data alone. Our approach is to set up a
   traditional model in which the true quality or impact of a university
   department is determined by a panel of experts, but a citation metric is
   regarded as a reasonable proxy. However, the model assumes that the
   information contained in the scores provided by an expert panel exceeds
   that contained in a citation metric (HEFCE, 2015). Finally, we extend
   this model by including altmetric data to see if it adds information
   about a department's performance that cannot be gleaned from citations
   alone. We find the presence of altmetric data for the cited underpinning
   research to be highly correlated with peer review scores for societal
   impact. Conversely, no such connection was seen with the assessment of
   research quality. Our findings therefore suggest altmetric data could be
   useful as an aid to assessing impact.}},

Abstract = {{Citizen science (CS) aims primarily to create a new scientific culture
   able to improve upon the triple interaction between science, society,
   and policy in the dual pursuit of more democratic research and
   decision-making informed by sound evidence. It is both an aim and an
   enabler of open science (OS), to which it contributes by involving
   citizens in research and encouraging participation in the generation of
   new knowledge. This study analyses scientific output on CS using
   bibliometric techniques and Web of Science (WoS) data. Co-occurrence
   maps are formulated to define subject clusters as background for an
   analysis of the impact of each on social media. Four clusters are
   identified: HEALTH, BIO, GEO and PUBLIC. The profiles for the four
   clusters are observed to be fairly similar, although BIO and HEALTH are
   mentioned more frequently in blogposts and tweets and BIO and PUBLIC in
   Facebook and newsfeeds. The findings also show that output in the area
   has grown since 2010, with a larger proportion of papers (66\%)
   mentioned in social media than reported in other studies. The percentage
   of open access documents (30.7\%) is likewise higher than the overall
   mean for all areas.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetrics have been proposed as a way to assess the societal impact of
   research. Although altmetrics are already in use as impact or attention
   metrics in different contexts, it is still not clear whether they really
   capture or reflect societal impact. This study is based on altmetrics,
   citation counts, research output and case study data from the UK
   Research Excellence Framework (REF), and peers' REF assessments of
   research output and societal impact. We investigated the convergent
   validity of altmetrics by using two REF datasets: publications submitted
   as research output (PRO) to the REF and publications referenced in case
   studies (PCS). Case studies, which are intended to demonstrate societal
   impact, should cite the most relevant research papers. We used the MHq'
   indicator for assessing impact - an indicator which has been introduced
   for count data with many zeros. The results of the first part of the
   analysis show that news media as well as mentions on Facebook, in blogs,
   in Wikipedia, and in policy-related documents have higher MHq' values
   for PCS than for PRO. Thus, the altmetric indicators seem to have
   convergent validity for these data. In the second part of the analysis,
   altmetrics have been correlated with REF reviewers' average scores on
   PCS. The negative or close to zero correlations question the convergent
   validity of altmetrics in that context. We suggest that they may capture
   a different aspect of societal impact (which can be called unknown
   attention) to that seen by reviewers (who are interested in the causal
   link between research and action in society). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the metrics provided by
   Publons about the scoring of publications and their relationship with
   impact measurements (bibliometric and altmetric indicators).
   Design/methodology/approach In January 2018, 45,819 research articles
   were extracted from Publons, including all their metrics (scores, number
   of pre and post reviews, reviewers, etc.). Using the DOI identifier,
   other metrics from altmetric providers were gathered to compare the
   scores of those publications in Publons with their bibliometric and
   altmetric impact in PlumX, Altmetric.com and Crossref Event Data.
   Findings The results show that: there are important biases in the
   coverage of Publons according to disciplines and publishers; metrics
   from Publons present several problems as research evaluation indicators;
   and correlations between bibliometric and altmetric counts and the
   Publons metrics are very weak (r<0.2) and not significant.
   Originality/value This is the first study about the Publons metrics at
   article level and their relationship with other quantitative measures

Journal = {{TRANSINFORMACAO}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{31}},
Abstract = {{Alternative metrics have been used as a complement to traditional
   metrics as tools to track the uses and social attention to scientific
   publications in the online environment. Open access scientific journals
   are potentially more likely to be shared and read by the public on
   social media. In this scenario, the scientific output of Brazil and
   Latin America, like those indexed in the SciELO database, which brings
   together relevant and open access scientific journals from the region,
   could benefit from altmetrics. However, analyzes of the
   representativeness of countries, languages and fields of knowledge in
   altmetrics reveal that the indicators need to be improved to value
   science in developing, non-English speaking, open access countries and
   national or regional relevance. This paper points out the limitations of
   altmetrics for science in Latin America, by analyzing the social media
   behavior of scholars and society, the presence of different languages to
   share articles, as well as the data that generate altmetrics, such as
   the ones produced by the British data provider Altmetric.com. Altmetrics
   have not been able to portray the attention that Brazilian scientific
   papers have received in social media, despite the efforts made by
   journals to disseminate science and engage with the public. It is
   necessary to expand data collection on Facebook, of contents and
   channels in Portuguese and Spanish, as well as to expand data collection
   of blogs and news outlets in the region.}},

   analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficients. The results showed
   significant differences between impact ranks using both indicators.
   Bibliometric indicators, including citations, library holdings, and book
   reviews, mainly reflect the academic impact of books, while altmetric
   indicators, including Amazon sales and Goodreads ratings, mainly reflect
   the social impact of those books. The most influential books and
   scholars were obtained based on each of the two indicator types. This
   effort can benefit academic efforts to evaluate the impact of books

Abstract = {{Objective - This study analyzes scholarly publications supported by
   library open access funds, including author demographics, journal
   trends, and article impact. It also identifies and summarizes open
   access fund criteria and viability. The goal is to better understand the
   sustainability of open access funds, as well as identify potential best
   practices for institutions with open access funds.
   Methods - Publication data was solicited from universities with open
   access (OA) funds, and supplemented with publication and author metrics,
   including Journal Impact Factor, Altmetric Attention Score, and author
   h-index. Additionally, data was collected from OA fund websites,
   Results - Library OA funds tend to support faculty in science and
   medical fields. Impact varied widely, especially between disciplines,
   but a limited measurement indicated an overall smaller relative impact
   of publications funded by library OA funds. Many open access funds
   operate using similar criteria related to author and publication
   eligibility, which seem to be largely successful at avoiding the funding
   of articles published in predatory journals.
   Conclusions - Libraries have successfully funded many publications using
   criteria that could constitute best practices in this area. However,
   institutions with OA funds may need to identify opportunities to
   increase support for high-impact publications, as well as consider the
   financial stability of these funds. Alternative models for OA support
   are discussed in the context of an ever-changing open access landscape.}},

   Lattes Platform-CNPq}},
Journal = {{TRANSINFORMACAO}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{31}},
Abstract = {{Field of the information metrics studies with nine years of existence,
   altmetrics has in Brazil a history three years more recent. If, on the
   other hand, we consider the field more broadly, such as scientometric
   studies based on cybermetric or web-based data, we could identify older
   works. However, delimitation of the field occurred in 2010, when Jason
   Priem coined the term ``altmetrics{''} via Twitter having arrived in
   Brazil as ``altmetria{''} in 2013. In the exploratory bibliometric study
   here presented, we used the Lattes curriculum to identify articles and
   communications in congresses of researchers, with or without a doctorate
   degree, who work in the field of altmetrics in Brazil, their large areas
   and areas of expertise, geographical distribution and the evolution of
   data and thematic sources over the years. To this end, the
   identification of curricula was made through the advanced search in the
   Lattes Platform by the terms ``altmetria{''}, ``altmetrico{''},
   ``altmetrica{''}, ``altmetric{''} or ``altmetrics{''}. The 94 curricula
   found, 37 of which were doctors and 57 of non-doctors, had their
   contents filtered by the search terms used. Twenty-six articles were
   identified in periodicals and 36 communications in events. From the 94
   researchers it is verified that 53 of them produced only in altmetrics
   and 41 with intercession with Facebook, Twitter or Mendeley. The field
   is dominated by researchers from the large area of Applied Social
   Sciences with emphasis on Information Science and to a lesser extent for
   Communication. Research focus have been evolving from more theoretical
   approaches towards practical, evaluative, critical and institutional and
   regional contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Digital and social media have grown exponentially to become highly
   influential spheres of public communication - increasingly crowded,

   engagement. As public debate is conducted more through social and
   digital media, alternative metrics ('altmetrics') that am generated from
   social and digital media platforms become important as indicators of
   impact and engagement. We review the growth of amplifier platforms and
   the academic and contextual reasons for their growth. Amplifier
   platforms are defined to distinguish them from traditional media outlets
   (where the scholarly voice is mediated through and `gatekept' by
   journalists, whose editors retain final control), personal blogs (very
   few of which can be maintained over time) and from social media
   platforms (where the scholarly voice is accorded no presumptive
   standing). A significant range of amplifier platforms is canvassed while
   acknowledging that in Australia, the amplifier platform the Conversation
   plays a central role.}},

Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{305-312}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report on the development and
   analysis of an internal bibliometric services workshop for subject
   librarians. Primary goals of the workshop were to create an opportunity
   for collegial knowledge and skill sharing, and to identify discipline
   specific gaps and future support requirements.
   Design/methodology/approach Two campus librarians who typically offer
   bibliometric support services used pre- and post-surveys to plan and
   assess the workshop for subject liaison librarians.
   Findings Subject librarians from across the university expressed
   interest in developing bibliometric support services. The 12 workshop
   participants (30 percent of subject librarians) support diverse areas
   including the humanities, social sciences, life sciences, education and
   outreach, and the school of business. Post-workshop survey respondents
   highlighted the contextualization of available measures and the
   appropriate application of metrics in different disciplines to be the
   most helpful topics covered. Finally, while the institution subscribes
   to several citation analysis databases, more familiarity with Google
   Scholar citations was requested to address user needs and preferences
   across the various disciplines. Most participants expressed interest in
   attending additional workshops.
   Originality/value This study showcases the experience of campus
   librarians working together across academic schools and disciplines to
   respond to the increasing demand for bibliometric and scholarly impact
   support services. While services such as citation analysis have
   typically been siloed in specific job descriptions or subject areas
   within the library, these are service areas that can benefit from
   internal library-collaboration opportunities and knowledge sharing.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the usage, captures,
   mentions, social media and citations of highly cited papers of Library
   and information science (LIS).
   Design/methodology/approach This study is quantitative research that was
   conducted using scientometrics and altmetrics indicators. The research
   sample consists of LIS classic papers. The papers contain highly cited
   papers of LIS that are introduced by Google Scholar. The research data
   have been gathered from Google Scholar, Scopus and Plum Analytics
   Categories. The data analysis has been done by Excel and SPSS
   applications.
   Findings The data indicate that among the highly cited articles of LIS,
   the highest score regarding the usage, captures, mentions and social
   media and the most abundance of citations belong to Citation advantage
   of open access articles and Usage patterns of collaborative tagging
   systems. Based on the results of Spearman statistical tests, there is a
   positive significant correlation between Google Scholar Citations and
   all studied indicators. However, only the correlation between Google
   Scholar Citations with capture metrics (p-value = 0.047) and citation
   metrics (p-value = 0.0001) was statistically significant.
   Originality/value Altmetrics indicators can be used as complement
   traditional indicators of Scientometrics to study the impact of papers.
   Therefore, the Altmetrics knowledge of LIS researchers and experts and
   practicing new studies in this field will be very important.}},

   focuses on LinkedIn to start tackling the question of the effects on

Abstract = {{The general approach of research impact evaluation is entirely based
   upon citations. But in the current Web2.0 era, this citation based
   evaluation process often do not include the generic discussions people
   make in social media, blogs, online scholarly discussion forums or even
   the online readership of the article. Aitmetrics, often referred as the
   article level metrics is a tool that have emerged, which crowd source
   all the non-citation based discussions from various web2.0 platforms and
   tries to reflect the overhaul attention that an article gets. Since its
   introduction, aitmetrics have been able to gather a good attention from
   the scientific community, and researchers are trying to evaluate if it
   does have scholarly value to complement the citation based impact
   measure process. The current study tries to evaluate altmetrics
   penetration in Indian research articles and the influence of altmetrics
   in the citation growth process. The problem was addressed taking the
   example of Indian research articles published in PLoS journals. Two
   hypothesis were set for the study and PLoS altmetrics data were taken to
   run the t-test for paired sample mean to test the hypothesis. Findings
   from the t-test estimated a low significant p value, hence rejecting the
   null hypothesis and accepting the alternate hypothesis proving the
   positive influence of aitmetrics in the citation growth process for the
   Indian research articles in PLoS journals. Also the presence of
   aitmetrics data in the Indian research articles of PLoS journals is
   evaluated in the study.}},

Abstract = {{The growing presence of research shared on social media, coupled with
   the increase in freely available research, invites us to ask whether
   scientific articles shared on platforms like Twitter diffuse beyond the
   academic community. We explore a new method for answering this question
   by identifying 11 articles from two open access biology journals that
   were shared on Twitter at least 50 times and by analyzing the follower
   network of users who tweeted each article. We find that diffusion
   patterns of scientific articles can take very different forms, even when
   the number of times they are tweeted is similar. Our small case study
   suggests that most articles are shared within single-connected
   communities with limited diffusion to the public. The proposed approach
   and indicators can serve those interested in the public understanding of
   science, science communication, or research evaluation to identify when
   research diffuses beyond insular communities.}},

Title = {{Twitter Mentions and Academic Citations in the Urologic Literature}},
Journal = {{UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{28-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE To quantify the relationship between the number of Twitter
   mentions and the number of academic citations a urologic publication
   receives.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred and thirteen papers from 7 prominent
   urologic journals were examined 37 months after publication. Articles
   were evaluated with 2 citation based ``bibliometrics{''} (Scopus, Google
   Scholar) and Twitter mentions were tracked using the Altmetric
   Bookmarklet. The number of article citations and Twitter mentions were
   compared using one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and bivariate fit
   analysis.
   RESULTS Seventy-three percent of articles had at least 1 Twitter
   mention. Forty-two percent of Twitter mentions occurred within the first
   week of the online publication date. Articles mentioned on Twitter had
   2.0-fold more Scopus citations (P < .01), and 2.3-fold more Google
   Scholar citations (P < .01) compared to articles with no Twitter
   mentions. Female urologic articles had the greatest number of Twitter
   mentions (5.7 mentions/article) while pediatric urology had the fewest
   mean number of Twitter mentions (0.8 mentions/article). A total of 8.9\%
   of papers were tweeted by their authors. Author tweeted articles were
   associated with a 12.3 (2.0-fold) and 15.5 (1.8-fold) mean citation
   increase for Scopus and Google Scholar (P < .01 and P = .01) compared to
   articles not shared by their authors on Twitter.
   CONCLUSION The majority of urologic publications are being shared on
   Twitter. The number of citations a urologic publication receives up to 3
   years after release is positively associated with the number of mentions
   it has on Twitter. Twitter activity may be an early indicator of
   ultimate academic impact of an academic urologic paper. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Modern research is increasingly data-driven and reliant on
   bioinformatics software. Publication is a common way of introducing new
   software, but not all bioinformatics tools get published. Giving there
   are competing tools, it is important not merely to find the appropriate
   software, but have a metric for judging its usefulness. Journal's impact
   factor has been shown to be a poor predictor of software popularity;
   consequently, focusing on publications in high-impact journals limits
   user's choices in finding useful bioinformatics tools. Free and open
   source software repositories on popular code sharing platforms such as
   GitHub provide another venue to follow the latest bioinformatics trends.
   The open source component of GitHub allows users to bookmark and copy
   repositories that are most useful to them. This Perspective aims to
   demonstrate the utility of GitHub ``stars,{''} ``watchers,{''} and
   ``forks{''} (GitHub statistics) as a measure of software impact. We
   compiled lists of impactful bioinformatics software and analyzed
   commonly used impact metrics and GitHub statistics of 50
   genomics-oriented bioinformatics tools. We present examples of
   community-selected best bioinformatics resources and show that GitHub
   statistics are distinct from the journal's impact factor (JIF), citation
   counts, and alternative metrics (Altmetrics, CiteScore) in capturing the
   level of community attention. We suggest the use of GitHub statistics as
   an unbiased measure of the usability of bioinformatics software
   complementing the traditional impact metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Progression-free survival is an increasingly popular surrogate end point
   for overall survival. The strength of correlation between the two end
   points varies, raising questions about the correlation between results
   of interim analyses that report mature progression-free survival data
   with the subsequent final publication that report overall survival.
   We searched PubMed from 2005 to 2015 for randomized controlled trials
   that measured both progression-free survival and overall survival. We
   matched interim publications that reported mature progression-free
   survival data with their final analyses that reported overall survival.
   We included 25 matched pairs and 8 unmatched interim analyses whose
   final analyses are not published. Our primary objectives are to compare
   interim publications with matched final publications in terms of journal
   prominence and Altmetric score and to compare progression-free survival
   and overall survival effect sizes.
   All interim analyses (n = 33) were prespecified and there was a
   statistically significant progression-free survival benefit in 31
   (93.9\%). Only eight matched final analyses had statistically
   significant overall survival data. Interim analyses were more often
   published in top-5 general medicine journals (P < 0.01) but not in top-5
   oncology journals (P = 0.26). Altmetric scores were higher in interim
   analyses (P < 0.01). Progression-free survival effect sizes from interim
   analyses were a median of 31\% larger than overall survival effect sizes
   from final analyses.
   Interim analyses with progression-free survival data may generate hype
   in oncology, as evidenced by journal impact factors and Altmetric
   scores. The cause of this hype may be due, in part, to large
   progression-free survival effect sizes. Regardless, in trials that
   investigate progression-free and overall survival, publishing interim
   analyses with mature progression-free survival data apart from the final
   analyses with mature overall survival should be cautioned.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we develop a method that uses altmetric data to analyse
   researchers' interactions, as a way of mapping the contexts of potential
   societal impact. In the face of an increasing policy demand for
   quantitative methodologies to assess societal impact, social media data
   (altmetrics) have been presented as a potential method to capture
   broader forms of impact. However, current altmetric indicators were
   extrapolated from traditional citation approaches and are seen as
   problematic for assessing societal impact. In contrast, established
   qualitative methodologies for societal impact assessment are based on
   interaction approaches. These argue that assessment should focus on
   mapping the contexts in which engagement among researchers and
   stakeholders takes place, as a means to understand the pathways to
   societal impact. Following these approaches, we propose to shift the use
   of altmetric data towards network analysis of researchers and
   stakeholders. We carry out two case studies, analysing researchers'
   networks with Twitter data. The comparison illustrates the potential of
   Twitter networks to capture disparate degrees of policy engagement. We
   propose that this mapping method can be used as an input within broader
   methodologies in case studies of societal impact assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We sought to delineate highly visible publications related to
   sepsis. Within these subsets, elements of altmetrics performance,
   including mentions on Twitter, and the correlation between altmetrics
   and conventional citation counts were ascertained.
   Materials and Methods: Three subsets of sepsis publications from 2012 to
   2017 were synthesized by the overall Altmetric.com attention score,
   number of mentions by unique Twitter users, and conventional citation
   counts. For these subsets, geolocated Twitter activity was plotted on a
   choropleth, the lag between publication date and altmetrics mentions was
   characterized, and correlations were examined between altmetrics
   performance and normalized conventional citation counts.
   Results: Of 57,152 PubMed query results, Altmetric.com data was
   available for 28,344 (49.6\%). The top 50 publications by Altmetric.com
   attention score and Twitter attention represented a mix of original
   research and other types of work, garnering attention from Twitter users
   in 143 countries that was highly contemporaneous with publication.
   Altmetrics performance and conventional citation counts were poorly
   correlated.
   Conclusions: While unreliable to gauge impact or future citation
   potential, altmetrics may be valuable for parties who wish to detect and
   drive public awareness of research findings and may enable researchers
   to dynamically explore the reach of their work in novel dimensions.

Title = {{A bibliometric method for assessing technological maturity: the case of

Journal = {{SCIENTOMETRICS}},

Abstract = {{While novel technologies have tremendous competitive potential, they
   also involve certain risks. Maturity assessment analyzes how well a
   technological development can fulfill an expected task. The technology
   readiness level (TRL) has been considered to be one of the most
   promising approaches for addressing technological maturity. Nonetheless,
   its assessment requires opinions of the experts, which is costly and
   implies the risk of personal bias. To fill this gap, this paper presents
   a Bibliometric Method for Assessing Technological Maturity (BIMATEM). It
   is a repeatable framework that assesses maturity quantitatively. Our
   method is based on the assumption that each technology life cycle stage
   can be matched to technology records contained in scientific literature,
   patents, and news databases. The scientific papers and patent records of
   mature technologies display a logistic growth behavior, while news
   records follow a hype-type behavior. BIMATEM determines the maturity
   level by curve fitting technology records to these behaviors. To test
   our approach, BIMATEM was applied to additive manufacturing (AM)
   technologies. Our results revealed that material extrusion, material
   jetting, powder bed fusion and vat photopolymerization are the most
   mature AM technologies with TRL between 6 and 7, followed by directed
   energy deposition with TRL between 4 and 5, and binder jetting and sheet
   lamination, the least mature, with TRL between 1 and 2. BIMATEM can be
   used by competitive technologyintelligence professionals, policymakers,
   and further decision makers whose main interests include assessing the
   risk of implementing new technologies. Future research can focus on
   testing the method with regard to altmetrics.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article evaluates the body of literature on Leonardo da Vinci using
   for the first time bibliometric and altmetric methods for data
   processing. The question of whether the literature on Leonardo da Vinci
   reflects his interdisciplinarity as scientist and artist is addressed.
   We argue that the medical and material sciences show a high number of
   citations to the respective publications, and much higher number of
   citations to publications ratio than the humanities and social sciences
   fields. We also found that there is no relationship between the number
   of publications for each research area and the citations (between
   productivity and quality). The largest category of papers, in terms of
   citations and in terms of the number of subfields, discussing da Vinci's
   contribution to the various sciences, belongs to exact sciences. This
   finding is surprising as Leonardo da Vinci has become a synonym for the
   mysterious artist whose paintings consist of many messages that are
   difficult to explain. Therefore it seems natural that Leonardo the
   artist would get a lot of research attention. Nevertheless, the
   bibliometric findings show that the academic community has interest in
   his contributions to science, no less than in his work of art.}},

Title = {{The effect of an infographic promotion on research dissemination and

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{826-833}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Journals use social media to increase the awareness of their
   publications. Infographics show research findings in a concise and
   visually appealing manner, well suited for dissemination on social media
   platforms. We hypothesized that infographic abstracts promoted on social
   media would increase the dissemination and online readership of the
   parent research articles.
   Methods: Twenty-four articles were chosen from the six issues of CJEM
   published between July 2016 and June 2017 and randomized to infographic
   or control groups. All articles were disseminated through the journal's
   social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook). Control articles were
   promoted using a screen capture image of each article's abstract on the
   journal's social media accounts. Infographic articles were promoted
   similarly using a visual infographic. Infographics were also published
   and promoted on the CanadiEM. org's website and social media channels.
   Abstract views, full-text views, and the change in Altmetric score were
   compared between groups using unpaired two-tailed t-tests.
   Results: There were no significant differences in the groups at
   baseline. Abstract views (mean, 95\% CI) were higher in the infographics
   (379, 287-471) than the control group (176, 136-215, p<0.001). Mean
   change in Altmetric scores was higher in the infographics (26, 18-34)
   than in the control group (3, 2-4, p<0.0001). There was no difference in
   full-text views between the infographics (50, 0-101) and control groups
   (25, 18-32).
   Conclusion: The promotion of CJEM articles using infographics on social
   media and the CanadiEM. org website increased Altmetric scores and
   abstract views. Infographics may have a role in increasing awareness of
   medical literature.}},

Abstract = {{There are known gender imbalances in participation in scientific fields,
   from female dominance of nursing to male dominance of mathematics. It is
   not clear whether there is also a citation imbalance, with some claiming
   that male-authored research tends to be more cited. No previous study
   has assessed gender differences in the readers of academic research on a
   large scale, however. In response, this article assesses whether there
   are gender differences in the average citations and/or Mendeley readers
   of academic publications. Field normalised logged Scopus citations and
   Mendeley readers from mid-2018 for articles published in 2014 were
   investigated for articles with first authors from India, Spain, Turkey,
   the UK and the USA in up to 251 fields with at least 50 male and female
   authors. Although female-authored research is less cited in Turkey
   (-4.0\%) and India (-3.6\%), it is marginally more cited in Spain
   (0.4\%), the UK (0.4\%), and the USA (0.2\%). Female-authored research
   has fewer Mendeley readers in India (-1.1\%) but more in Spain (1.4\%),
   Turkey (1.1\%), the UK (2.7\%) and the USA (3.0\%). Thus, whilst there
   may be little practical gender difference in citation impact in
   countries with mature science systems, the higher female readership
   impact suggests a wider audience for female-authored research. The
   results also show that the conclusions from a gender analysis depend on
   the field normalisation method. A theoretically informed decision must
   therefore be made about which normalisation to use. The results also
   suggest that arithmetic mean-based field normalisation is favourable to
   males. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Twitter-based journal clubs are intended to connect
   clinicians, educators, and researchers to discuss recent research and
   aid in dissemination of results. The Journal of Hospital Medicine (JHM)
   began producing a Twitter-based journal club, \#JHMChat, in 2015.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation and assess the impact of a
   journal-sponsored, Twitter-based journal club on Twitter and journal
   metrics.
   INTERVENTION: Each \#JHMChat focused on a recently published JHM
   article, was moderated by a social media editor, and included one study
   author or guest.
   MEASUREMENTS: The total number of participants, tweets,
   tweets/participant, impressions, page views, and change in the Altmetric
   score were assessed after each session. Thematic analysis of each
   article was conducted, and post-chat surveys of participating authors
   and participant responses to continuing medical education surveys were
   reviewed.
   RESULTS: Seventeen Twitter-based chats were held: seven (47\%) focused
   on value, six (40\%) targeted clinical issues, and four (27\%) focused
   on education. On average, we found 2.17 (+/- 0.583 SD) million
   impressions/session, 499 (+/- 129 SD) total tweets/session, and 73 (+/-
   24 SD) participants/session. Value-based care articles had the greatest
   number of impressions (2.61 +/- 0.55 million) and participants (90 +/-
   12). The mean increase in the Altmetric score was 14 points (+/- 12),
   with medical education-themed articles garnering the greatest change
   (mean increase of 32). Page views were noted to have increased similarly
   to levels of electronic Table of Content releases. Authors and
   participants believed \#JHMChat was a valuable experience and rated it
   highly on post-chat evaluations.
   CONCLUSION: Online journal clubs appear to increase awareness and uptake
   of journal article results and are considered a useful tool by
   participants. (C) 2018 Society of Hospital Medicine}},

Abstract = {{The Energy Saving sector is key to the development of countries due to
   its economic, social and environmental impact. At the scientific level,
   its importance is perceived in the support of different international
   funding agencies to finance research on this subject. In order to
   analyse the characteristics and impact of these initiatives, this paper
   examines the European projects into the Seventh Framework Programme on
   Energy Saving. Using a bibliometric methodology, the flow of scientific
   information from these projects to scientific publications is analyzed.
   Finally, in order to know the social repercussions of these research,
   the impact of the projects and publications on social media has been
   considered. Methodologically, a multiple linear regression model was
   developed to relate the variables from each information source and to
   detect the ones that contribute to the social media impact of scientific
   publications. The results show that the research activities in Energy
   Saving are concentrated in Germany, France, United Kingdom and Spain. In
   general, the main partners are companies and public research centers and
   no link has been found between the funding received and the size of the
   research consortia. As for the model developed, it has been found that
   the journal, documental type and international collaboration are the
   most significant factors for the impact of research in social media. (C)

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Climate change research aims to understand global environmental change
   and how it will impact nature and society. The broad scope of climate
   change impacts means that successful adaptation and mitigation efforts
   will require an unprecedented collaboration effort that unites diverse
   disciplines and is able to rapidly respond to evolving climate issues
   (IPCC, 2014). However, to achieve this aim, climate change research
   practices need updating: key research findings remain behind journal
   paywalls, and scientific progress can be impeded by low levels of
   reproducibility and transparency (Ellison, 2010; Morueta-Holme et al.,
   2018), individual data ownership (Hampton et al., 2015), and inefficient
   research workflows (Lowndes et al., 2017). Furthermore, the level of
   public interest and policy engagement on climate change issues relies on
   fast communication of academic research to public institutions, with the
   result that the societal impact of climate change studies will differ
   according to their public availability and exposure. Here, we argue that
   by adopting open science (OS) principles, scientists can advance climate
   change research and accelerate efforts to mitigate impacts; especially
   for highly vulnerable developing regions of the world where research
   capacity is limited. We underscore the specific benefits of OS in
   raising the academic and societal impact of climate change research
   using citation and media metrics.}},

Abstract = {{The scientific journal is an important part of scholarly communication
   and for a long time it has functioned both as the sole dissemination
   channel of research findings and as an important indicator of research
   quality. Recently altmetrics have been investigated for their
   applicability for research assessment. The potential of and hope
   attached to altmetrics is that they could function as complements to
   more traditional metrics and possibly reflect some aspects of new forms
   of online scholarly communication. This research will investigate
   aggregation of altmetrics at journal-level and the online presence and
   visibility of selected Korea-based journals. Based on our findings we
   can conclude that Open Access availability is a clear driver for higher
   online attention for Korean scientific journals, however, this attention
   is also heavily influenced by the popularity of a few articles that have
   attracted significant online attention. Because of the influence some
   popular articles can have on the aggregated journal-level attention,
   journal-level altmetrics do not appear to be reliable nor useful
   indicators of the performance of scientific journals.}},

   been derived. In order to find out about the reliability of the h(men)
   index as an indicator to assess scholarly impact, a correlation analysis
   between the indices has been conducted. Furthermore, the index values
   were divided by the scientific ages of the authors in order to obtain
   time-oriented h and h(men) values which make a comparison of authors
   with different scientific ages possible. The h(men) index was found to
   have very strong positive and highly significant correlations of around
   0.95 with each of the h indices. Time-oriented values showed the faster
   reception of scientific work via Mendeley in comparison to citation
   counts and revealed exceptional authors who were found to have rather
   young scientific ages.}},

Abstract = {{The reliable assessment of individual faculty members' contributions is
   a key challenge in the governance of research institutions.
   Traditionally, scientific impact is estimated based on bibliographic
   analyses. With online platforms, particularly social media, gaining
   popularity among academics, new opportunities for the analysis of
   scientific impact arise. Proponents of the altmetrics approach hold that
   both general purpose social media and services tailored to the
   scientific community allow for a range of usage metrics that may inform
   scientific impact assessment. We propose that relational analyses of
   social media platforms may shed new light on these understudied
   dimensions of scientific impact and may enrich assessment efforts. Based
   on a sample of Swiss management scholars' active on ResearchGate, we
   conduct a social network analysis, derive relational metrics, and
   correlate these metrics with bibliometrics, webometrics, and altmetrics
   to gauge their potential to inform scientific impact assessment,
   specifically in business and management research.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetrics is an emerging topic that has generated much interest. Most
   of the studies, however, have focused on the comparison of altemetric
   indicators with traditional citation metrics and few have explored the
   factors influencing altmetric performance. This study investigates the
   dissemination pattern of scientific articles on social medial, and is
   particularly focused on highly tweeted articles and highly cited
   articles. Based on bibliometric and altmetric data collected for over
   40,000 articles in the field of biology, we found that the timing of
   tweets and the type of Twitter accounts affect the amount of attention
   that a scientific publication receives on social media. Articles with a
   large number of tweets tend to be the ones receiving immediate social
   media exposure and are often tweeted by journal associated organization
   accounts or other individual accounts with a large number of followers.
   By contrast, highly cited articles in general are neither tweeted timely
   nor promoted by their respective journal accounts.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Today, the dissemination methods of scientific
   publications and Web access ways to them have changed. It is essential
   to use the new altmetric measurements to assess the impact of research
   products in addition to traditional indicators. Purpose: The purpose of
   this study was to investigate and compare the correlation between the
   number of citations of Iranian scholars' articles indexed in WoS and
   their readership rate in the two social networks of Mendeley and RG.
   Methods: The quantitative methods used in this analytical-descriptive
   survey such as the scientometric / altmetric and correlation study. The
   statistical population consisted of scientific articles by the Iranian
   scholars in WoS. The sample of the research was 165 retrieved articles
   with 200 citations or more, in WoS with the address ``Iran{''}. Data was
   collected from WoS. Mendeley and RG and analyzed by using Excel and SPSS
   software. Findings: The findings showed that the correlation between the
   number of citations of the articles and the degree of readership in
   Mendeley was 0.352 based on the Spearman's correlation coefficient. The
   correlation between the number of citations of the articles and the rate
   of readership in RG was 0.177. The findings indicated a positive and
   moderate correlation with a confidence level of 99\% for Mendeley and a
   positive, but poor correlation for RG with 95\% confidence. There was a
   significant correlation between the readability of articles in two
   Mendeley and RG based on Spearman coefficient (correlation of 0.382 at
   0.01 significance level) with a positive and average correlation.
   Conclusion: It was concluded that altmetric can be used as a
   complementary indicator beside traditional indices. Mendeley is an
   appropriate tool to evaluate the research work of scholars, universities
   and institutes and countries. OriginalityNalue: For the first time,
   correlation is measured between the articles' citations in Web of
   Science (WoS) and the readership rate in Mendeley and ResearchGate (RG).
   The results of this research clear the value of academic social networks
   in the dissemination of scientific productions. These networks can
   increase the use of authentic scientific works. The results of this
   study encourage scientists to share their scientific productions on
   these networks.}},

   of communicating and publicising research findings, additional
   alternative measures of impact (altmetrics) are now being used. In
   addition to analysing the reach of a research output, bibliometrics can
   also be used as search tools to identify related and updated research,

Abstract = {{Social media are considered perfect examples of Web 2.0 applications,
   which people use to communicate and collaborate together. Baidu Baike, a
   wiki-like online encyclopedia, is analysed as a typical example in which
   experts and lay Internet users collaborate. Entries in Biomedical
   Science section are analysed to reveal communication activities behind
   the construction of such scholarly entries. The composition of the
   related entries, references of each entry, cooperation among
   contributors of entries, and common interests of contributors are
   analysed with Altmetrics, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and
   heterogeneous coupling. Altmetrics is used to analyse scholarly
   communication during the construction of entries. Citation analysis
   based on references in entries provides a way to establish indirect
   communication between citing and cited authors, namely the contributors
   of entries and authors of references. Co-occurrence analysis is used for
   the analysis of cooperation both among experts and lay Internet users
   and the distribution of tags of entries. Heterogeneous coupling is used
   to reveal the relationship among entries based on common references as
   well as common experts. The results show that literature is referred to
   during people's online communication. The citations and tags of entries
   reflect the interdisciplinary specializations within Biomedical Science.
   The majority of experts cooperated with someone in the same affiliation
   but cross-unit cooperation also existed. The common interests of experts
   indicate that the specialists only master their own field. Moreover, as
   a typical general public, lay Internet users have a wide range of
   interests and remain enthusiastic about entry contribution.}},

Abstract = {{There are three main reasons for retraction: (1) ethical misconduct
   (e.g. duplicate publication, plagiarism, missing credit, no IRB,
   ownership issues, authorship issues, interference in the review process,
   citation manipulation); (2) scientific distortion (e.g. data
   manipulation, fraudulent data, unsupported conclusions, questionable
   data validity, non-replicability, data errors-even if unintended); (3)
   administrative error (e.g. article published in wrong issue, not the
   final version published, publisher errors). The first category, although
   highly deplorable has almost no effect on the advancement of science,
   the third category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the
   second category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view,
   as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only
   on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal
   characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication,
   years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and
   social media attention by the three major categories. The data set
   comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from
   Elsevier's ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were
   retrieved four times within 4 years, which allowed us to examine
   post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for
   Mendeley reader counts. The major findings are that both citation counts
   and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction.}},

Title = {{Relationships between abstract features and methodological quality
   explained variations of social media activity derived from systematic
   reviews about psoriasis interventions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the relationship among
   abstract structure, readability, and completeness, and how these
   features may influence social media activity and bibliometric results,
   considering systematic reviews (SRs) about interventions in psoriasis
   classified by methodological quality.
   Study Design and Setting: Systematic literature searches about psoriasis
   interventions were undertaken on relevant databases. For each review,
   methodological quality was evaluated using the assessing the
   methodological quality of systematic reviews tool. Abstract extension,
   structure, readability, and quality and completeness of reporting were
   analyzed. Social media activity, which consider Twitter and Facebook
   mention counts, as well as Mendeley readers and Google scholar citations
   were obtained for each article. Analyses were conducted to describe any
   potential influence of abstract characteristics on review's social media
   diffusion.
   Results: We classified 139 intervention SRs as displaying
   high/moderate/low methodological quality. We observed that abstract
   readability of SRs has been maintained high for last 20 years, although
   there are some differences based on their methodological quality. Free
   format abstracts were most sensitive to the increase of text readability
   as compared with more structured abstracts (Introduction, Methods,
   Results, and Discussion or eight headings), yielding opposite effects on
   their quality and completeness depending on the methodological quality:
   a worsening in low quality reviews and an improvement in those of high
   quality. Both readability indices and preferred reporting items of
   systematic reviews and meta-analyses for Abstract total scores showed an
   inverse relationship with social media activity and bibliometric results
   in high methodological quality reviews but not in those of lower
   quality.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that increasing abstract readability
   must be specially considered when writing free format summaries of
   high-quality reviews because this fact correlates with an improvement of
   their completeness and quality, and this may help to achieve broader
   social media visibility and article usage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to measure differences between three relevant

   More than 67,000 research papers, initially extracted from PlumX, were

   between services were analyzed regarding the number of documents with an
   altmetric event and the counting differences in each metric. Results
   show that Altmetric.com is the provider with the best coverage of blog
   posts, news and tweets; while PlumX better collects Mendeley readers;
   and CED is the site that extracts more Wikipedia citations. The study
   concludes that there are important counting differences due to technical
   errors and extracting criteria. The article recommends the use of
   specific services for the analysis of particular metrics. While, it
   should be mandatory to employ the combination of several providers, if
   we want to perform an overall analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Bibliometric and Altmetric analyses highlight key publications, which
   have been considered to be the most influential in their field. The
   hypothesis was that highly cited articles would correlate positively
   with levels of evidence and Altmetric scores (AS) and rank.
   Surgery as a search term was entered into Thomson Reuter's Web of
   Science database to identify all English-language full articles. The 100
   most cited articles were analysed by topic, journal, author, year,
   institution, and AS.
   By bibliometric criteria, eligible articles numbered 286,122 and the
   median (range) citation number was 574 (446-5746). The most cited
   article (Dindo et al.) classified surgical complications by severity
   score (5746 citations). Annals of Surgery published most articles and
   received most citations (26,457). The country and year with most
   publications were the USA (n = 50) and 1999 (n = 11). By Altmetric
   criteria, the article with the highest AS was by Bigelow et al. (AS =
   53, hypothermia's role in cardiac surgery); Annals of Surgery published
   most articles, and the country and year with most publications were USA
   (n = 4) and 2007 (n = 3). Level-1-evidence articles numbered 13, but no
   correlation was found between evidence level and citation number (SCC
   0.094, p = 0.352) or AS (SCC = 0.149, p = 0.244). Median AS was 0
   (0-53), and in articles published after the year 2000, AS was associated
   with citation number (r = 0.461, p = 0.001) and citation rate index (r =
   0.455, p = 0.002). AS was not associated with journal impact factor (r =
   0.160, p = 0.118).
   Bibliometric and Altmetric analyses provide important but different
   perspectives regarding article impact, which are unrelated to evidence
   level.}},

   impact of research}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{The social impact of research has usually been analysed through the
   scientific outcomes produced under the auspices of the research. The
   growth of scholarly content in social media and the use of altmetrics by
   researchers to track their work facilitate the advancement in evaluating
   the impact of research. However, there is a gap in the identification of
   evidence of the social impact in terms of what citizens are sharing on
   their social media platforms. This article applies a social impact in
   social media methodology (SISM) to identify quantitative and qualitative
   evidence of the potential or real social impact of research shared on
   social media, specifically on Twitter and Facebook. We define the social
   impact coverage ratio (SICOR) to identify the percentage of tweets and
   Facebook posts providing information about potential or actual social
   impact in relation to the total amount of social media data found
   related to specific research projects. We selected 10 projects in
   different fields of knowledge to calculate the SICOR, and the results
   indicate that 0.43\% of the tweets and Facebook posts collected provide
   linkages with information about social impact. However, our analysis
   indicates that some projects have a high percentage (4.98\%) and others
   have no evidence of social impact shared in social media. Examples of
   quantitative and qualitative evidence of social impact are provided to
   illustrate these results. A general finding is that novel evidences of
   social impact of research can be found in social media, becoming
   relevant platforms for scientists to spread quantitative and qualitative
   evidence of social impact in social media to capture the interest of
   citizens. Thus, social media users are showed to be intermediaries
   making visible and assessing evidence of social impact.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study is to describe the life cycle of
   altmetric and bibliometric indicators in a sample of publications.
   Altmetrics (Downloads, Views, Readers, Tweets, and Blog mentions) and
   bibliometric counts (Citations) (in this study, the indicators will be
   capitalized to differentiate them from the general language) of 5185
   publications (19,186 observations) were extracted from PlumX to observe
   their distribution according to the publication age. Correlations
   between these metrics were calculated from month to month to observe the
   evolution of these relationships. The results showed that mention
   metrics (Tweets and Blog mentions) are the earliest metrics that become
   available most quickly and have the shortest life cycle. Next, Readers
   are the metrics with the highest prevalence and with the second fastest
   growth. Views and Downloads show a continuous growth, being the
   indicators with the longest life cycles. Finally, Citations are the
   slowest indicators and have a low prevalence. Correlations show a strong
   relationship between mention metrics and Readers and Downloads, and
   between Readers and Citations. These results enable us to create a
   schematic diagram of the relationships between these metrics from a
   longitudinal view. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Language distribution in scientific communication reflects the influence
   of different languages on science in global perspective. The study,
   based on over 450 thousand scientific tweets of all publications indexed
   by Scopus in June 2015, reveals the language distribution in informal
   scientific communication. Moreover, this result is compared with the
   language distribution in formal scientific communication reflected in
   scientific publications. Results show: (1) The language of scientific
   tweets is concentrated in English (91\%), Japanese (2.4\%) and Spanish
   (1.7\%), while the language of scientific publications is concentrated
   in English (90.6\%), Chinese (5\%) and German (1.1\%). (2) Both
   scientific tweets and scientific publications present disciplinary
   differences in language distribution, reflecting the different amount of
   attention that authors of different languages have on certain
   disciplines. (3) Except Saudi Arabia, investigated countries all over
   the world, regardless of whether their native language is English or
   not, all have English scientific tweets in the dominant position. For
   the vast majority of these countries, the native language scientific
   tweets only rank the second position. (4) Overall, 26\% of tweeters use
   more than one language to tweet scientific products, while 49\% of
   scientific tweeters tweet everything in English only. The results
   indicate that English has undoubtedly become the lingua franca in
   informal scientific communication. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{While ResearchGate has become the most popular academic social
   networking site in terms of regular users, not all institutions have
   joined and the scores it assigns to academics and institutions are
   controversial. This paper assesses the presence in ResearchGate of
   higher education institutions in Europe and the US in 2017, and the
   extent to which institutional ResearchGate Scores reflect institutional
   academic impact. Most of the 2258 European and 4355 US higher
   educational institutions included in the sample had an institutional
   ResearchGate profile, with near universal coverage for PhD-awarding
   institutions found in the Web of Science (WoS). For non-PhD awarding
   institutions that did not publish, size (number of staff members) was
   most associated with presence in ResearchGate. For PhD awarding
   institutions in WoS, presence in RG was strongly related to the number
   of WoS publications. In conclusion, a) institutional RG scores reflect
   research volume more than visibility and b) this indicator is highly
   correlated to the number of WoS publications. Hence, the value of RG
   Scores for institutional comparisons is limited. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Recently, two new indicators (Equalized Mean-based Normalized Proportion
   Cited, EMNPC; Mean-based Normalized Proportion Cited, MNPC) were
   proposed which are intended for sparse scientometrics data, e.g.,
   alternative metrics (altmetrics). The indicators compare the proportion
   of mentioned papers (e.g. on Facebook) of a unit (e.g., a researcher or
   institution) with the proportion of mentioned papers in the
   corresponding fields and publication years (the expected values). In
   this study, we propose a third indicator (Mantel-Haenszel quotient, MHq)
   belonging to the same indicator family. The MHq is based on the MH
   analysis - an established method in statistics for the comparison of
   proportions. We test (using citations and assessments by peers, i.e.
   F1000Prime recommendations) if the three indicators can distinguish
   between different quality levels as defined on the basis of the
   assessments by peers. Thus, we test their convergent validity. We find
   that the indicator MHq is able to distinguish between the quality levels
   in most cases while MNPC and EMNPC are not. Since the MHq is shown in
   this study to be a valid indicator, we apply it to six types of
   zero-inflated altmetrics data and test whether different altmetrics
   sources are related to quality. The results for the various altmetrics
   demonstrate that the relationship between altmetrics (Wikipedia,
   Facebook, blogs, and news data) and assessments by peers is not as
   strong as the relationship between citations and assessments by peers.
   Actually, the relationship between citations and peer assessments is
   about two to three times stronger than the association between
   altmetrics and assessments by peers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Counts of tweets and Mendeley user libraries have been proposed as
   altmetric alternatives to citation counts for the impact assessment of
   articles. Although both have been investigated to discover whether they
   correlate with article citations, it is not known whether users tend to
   tweet or save (in Mendeley) the same kinds of articles that they cite.
   In response, this article compares pairs of articles that are tweeted,
   saved to a Mendeley library, or cited by the same user, but possibly a
   different user for each source. The study analyzes 1,131,318 articles
   published in 2012, with minimum tweeted (10), saved to Mendeley (100),
   and cited (10) thresholds. The results show surprisingly minor overall
   overlaps between the three phenomena. The importance of journals for
   Twitter and the presence of many bots at different levels of activity
   suggest that this site has little value for impact altmetrics. The
   moderate differences between patterns of saving and citation suggest
   that Mendeley can be used for some types of impact assessments, but
   sensitivity is needed for underlying differences.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study is to quantify the relationship
   between social media use and the dissemination of research across
   nontraditional channels.
   Methods: Between June and August of 2016, the authors identified 10
   plastic surgery journals with the highest impact factor and their 10
   most widely circulated articles. Article age; journal impact factor;
   ``distinguished{''} article designation; and social media metadata of
   the first authors, last authors, and journals were incorporated into a
   multivariate regression model to predict the Altmetric Attention Score,
   a quantitative measure of popularity across Web-based media platforms.
   Results: A total of 100 articles, 181 authors, and 10 journals were
   identified. Older articles tended to be less popular. The article's
   popularity was associated with the journal's audience size, but not with
   the author's social media activity. For each 1000 additional Twitter
   followers of the journal of publication, the Altmetric score is greater
   by a factor of 1.72 (95 percent CI, 1.076 to 2.749), which is the
   equivalent of 72 percent more Tweets. There is also a small but
   statistically significant negative association between the author's
   social media audience size and the popularity of his or her articles:
   for every 1000 additional followers, the Altmetric score is lower by a
   factor of 0.822 (95 percent CI, 0.725 to 0.932), which is the equivalent
   of 17.8 percent fewer Tweets.
   Conclusion: The popularity of an article across social media platforms
   is associated with the journal's audience on social media, not with the
   magnitude of the author's social media activity.}},

   proposed a new family of field- and time-normalized indicators, which is
   intended for sparse data. These indicators are based on units of
   analysis (e.g., institutions) rather than on the paper level. They
   compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g., on Twitter) of a unit
   with the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields and
   publication years. We propose a new indicator (Mantel-Haenszel quotient,
   MHq) for the indicator family. The MHq is rooted in the Mantel-Haenszel
   (MH) analysis. This analysis is an established method, which can be used
   to pool the data from several 2 x 2 cross tables based on different
   subgroups. We investigate using citations and assessments by peers
   whether the indicator family can distinguish between quality levels
   defined by the assessments of peers. Thus, we test the convergent
   validity. We find that the MHq is able to distinguish between quality
   levels in most cases while other indicators of the family are not. Since
   our study approves the MHq as a convergent valid indicator, we apply the
   MHq to four different Twitter groups as defined by the company
   Altmetric. Our results show that there is a weak relationship between
   the Twitter counts of all four Twitter groups and scientific quality,
   much weaker than between citations and scientific quality. Therefore,
   our results discourage the use of Twitter counts in research evaluation.}},

   focus on academic use. Recently altmetrics, which track alternate
   dissemination forms (e.aEuro<overline>g., social media), have been
   suggested as a complement to citation-based metrics. This study examines
   the relationship between altmetrics and traditional measures: journal
   article citations and access counts.
   The researchers queried Web of Science and Altmetric Explorer for
   articles published in HPE journals between 2013-2015. They identified
   2,486 articles with altmetrics. Data were analyzed using negative
   binomial and linear regression models.
   Blogging was associated with the greatest increase in citations (13\%
   increase), whereas Tweets (1.2\%) and Mendeley (1\%) were associated
   with smaller increases. Journal impact factor (JIF) was associated with
   a 21\% increase in citations. Publicly accessible articles were
   associated with a 19\% decrease, but the interactive effect between
   accessible articles and JIF was associated with a 12\% increase. When
   examining access counts, publicly accessible articles had an increase of
   170 access counts whereas blogging was associated with a decrease of 87
   accesses.
   This study suggests that several altmetrics outlets are positively
   associated with citations, and that public accessibility, holding all
   other independent variables constant, is positively related to article
   access. Given the scientific community's evolving focus on dissemination
   these findings have implications for stakeholders, providing insight
   into the factors that may improve citations and access of articles.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We aimed to assess the impact of open access (OA) versus
   paywalled access (PA) publication on Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS)
   and whether AAS correlates with future citation count access in the
   context of intensive care medicine (ICM) and anesthesia.
   Methods: 1854 and 2935 publications, in the year 2015, were identified
   in ICM and anesthesia respectively, using a Pubmed search. The mean AAS
   was measured for each article.
   Results: More ICM articles were OA, compared to of anesthesia articles
   (38.9\% v 35.0\% p=0.02). The mean AAS for OA ICM publications was
   significantly higher than that of PA ICM publications (17.34 vs 8.45, p
   < 0.01), however, this was not observed when examined in a fixed follow
   up time frame. AAS appear to correlate with future citation counts.
   Conclusions: ICM publications that are available as OA in the medium
   term result in higher AAS when compared to PA publications, this
   phenomenon was not observed in anesthesia. AAS correlate with future
   citation counts, however, a larger study is required to confirm this.

   Results A total of 582,227 PubMed records were found. The mean Altmetric
   scores were 3.7 +/- 18, 4.1 +/- 16 and 3.2 +/- 14 for clinical trials,
   reviews and free full-text articles, respectively. Sensitivity analysis
   showed that news outlets, tweeters and scientific bloggers were the most
   important and influential Altmetric data resources. Among 150 analysed
   dental journals the British Dental Journal acquired the first rank.
   Twitter was the most popular Altmetric resource among dental journals.

Abstract = {{Altmetric indicators are increasingly present in the research landscape.
   Among this ecosystem of heterogeneous indicators, social reference
   managers have been proposed as indicators of broader use of scholarly
   work. However, little work has been done to understand the data
   underlying this indicator. The present work uses a large-scale survey to
   study the users of two prominent social reference managers-Mendeley and
   Zotero. The survey examines demographic characteristics, usage of the
   platforms, as well as attitudes towards key issues in scholarly
   communication, such as open access, peer review, privacy, and the reward
   system of science. Results show strong differences between platforms:
   Mendeley users are younger and more gender-balanced; Zotero users are
   more engaged in social media and more likely to come from the social
   sciences and humanities. Zotero users are more likely to use the
   platform's search functions and to organize their libraries, while
   Mendeley users are more likely to take advantage of some of the
   discovery and networking features-such as browsing papers and groups and
   connecting with other users. We discuss the implications of using
   metrics derived from these platforms as impact indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To describe evidences of certain bibliographic issues and
   their influence on altmetrics and bibliometrics indicators, considering
   a set of Brazilian, Spanish and Portuguese articles.
   Design/Methodology/Approach. From an exploratory approach, a total of
   133 articles, available in ScienceOpen and best-positioned from the
   altmetrics counts, have been analyzed according to characteristics as
   publication date, authorship and collaboration, subject area, language,
   number of citations and, finally, altmetrics values derived from
   altmetric attention scores and mentions collected by Altmetric.
   Results/Discussion. Data show differences among countries regarding some
   issues - for example, number of authors by article, or language of
   publication-for the best-positioned articles in altmetrics rankings. For
   the whole sample, it is remarkable that more recent articles obtain more
   mentions and shared authorship is usual.
   Conclusions. Altmetrics evaluate visibility and reception of academic
   articles in web and social media, so they enrich citation data and
   extend the scope of the scientific production beyond the academic
   community. It is required to study and understand the social impact of
   science and to identify which elements of the publication process have
   direct influences over the popularization of scientific research.
   Originality/Value. Besides of dealing with a sample of Ibero-american
   articles, usually underrepresented in bibliometric databases, this study
   emphasizes the complementary role of the different dimensions that have
   to be taken into account in scientific communication.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is twofold: a) to describe and compare
   methods of early career researcher (ECR) assessment/appraisal; b) to
   explain how ECRs build, showcase, and monitor their reputation in an era
   of novel developments in scholarly communications. In all, 116 ECRs from
   China, France, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the US were
   questioned about appraisal and reputation in structured in-depth
   interviews. Desk research supplemented the interview data. It was found
   that ECRs are assessed very traditionally, largely on journal papers,
   and cannot (although some would like to) see this state of affairs
   changing. Mainly, they would prefer that less weight be given to the
   volume of papers published and more weight given to the quality of their
   research and its impact on the body of knowledge in their field.
   Unavoidably, then, ECRs' efforts to build, showcase, and monitor their
   reputation are still very much associated with research achievements.
   Nevertheless, online scholarly communities, and ResearchGate in
   particular, are gaining ground among ECRs, with increase in visibility
   and citations, and therefore a maximization of research impact,
   considered to be their main reputational benefits. Metrics are regarded
   as a rule of the game' that has to be accepted, although ECRs have
   minimal interest in altmetrics.}},

Abstract = {{Recent altmetrics research has started to investigate the meaning of
   altmetrics and whether altmetrics could reveal something about the
   attention or impact connected to research. This research continues this
   line of investigations and studies reasons for why some research has
   received significant online attention in one or both of two social media
   services; Twitter or Mendeley. This research investigated Finnish
   researchers' opinions about the reasons for why their research had
   received significant online attention and if the attention received
   could reflect scientific or societal impact of their research.
   Furthermore it was studied whether the authors of the papers with
   significant online attention actively followed how their papers were
   shared or discussed online and if the authors thought that the online
   attention increased either the scientific or societal impact of their
   work. Based on the findings it can be stated that the level of online
   attention received is a sum of many factors and that there are also
   specific differences between the platforms where the attention has been
   received. For the articles that had received significant attention on
   Mendeley the reasons for that attention were more often seen as due to
   an academic audience, while the situation was reverse on Twitter, with
   the majority of reasons for the attention being linked to a wider
   audience. Similar trend could be seen when asked about whether the
   online attention could reflect scientific or societal impact, although a
   clear consensus about whether online attention could reflect any type of
   impact at all could not be reached.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the possibility of extracting scientometric data
   from social media. Basic approaches to typification and classification
   of altmetrics are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of using
   altmetrics as scientometric indicators are investigated. The concept of
   webification of bibliometric indicators is introduced. Several examples
   of webometric indicators are discussed. Webometric indicators are
   designed to evaluate academic performance of researchers. A new
   criterion is introduced for the use in the performance-based ranking of
   researchers. This criterion applies webometric indicators that are
   calculated on the basis of altmetrics.}},

Abstract = {{Social media has provided new opportunities for both female and male
   academics to disseminate their research results, and presence on the
   Internet is found to increase the visibility of scholars. Thus, this
   study examined whether there were differences in terms of scientific
   productivity or the visibility (both in terms of citations and social
   media metrics) of female and male scholars in the field of neurosurgery.
   To do this, 11,127 articles and reviews from 2012 to 2014 were extracted
   from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. This accounted for
   14,944 unique authors. To study the visibility of neurosurgery scholars
   in terms of social media metrics, the following altmetric indicators
   were used: Mendeley readers, the post count of news, tweets, blogs,
   LinkedIn, and Facebook. The methodology and procedures employed included
   descriptive statistics, chi-square test, two-sample proportion test, and
   analysis of covariance. The results demonstrated that the number of
   female scholars was significantly lower compared to their male
   counterparts. Additionally, female neurosurgery scientists were found to
   be slightly less prolific in terms of scientific productivity. However,
   women were slightly more visible with regard to citations, readership,
   and tweets. Finally, both genders were similarly successful in terms of
   receivingmentions from blogs, news, Facebook, or LinkedIn.}},

   further development of the initial inventory are highlighted, as well as
   potential for using the inventory as a tool to guide project management,

Abstract = {{This study examines a range of factors associated with future citation
   and altmetric counts to a paper. The factors include journal impact
   factor, individual collaboration, international collaboration,
   institution prestige, country prestige, research funding, abstract
   readability, abstract length, title length, number of cited references,
   field size, and field type and will be modeled in association with
   citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter posts, Facebook posts, blog
   posts, and news posts. The results demonstrate that eight factors are
   important for increased citation counts, seven different factors are
   important for increased Mendeley readers, eight factors are important
   for increased Twitter posts, three factors are important for increased
   Facebook posts, six factors are important for increased blog posts, and
   five factors are important for increased news posts. Journal impact
   factor and international collaboration are the two factors that
   significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all
   altmetric scores. Moreover, it seems that the factors driving Mendeley
   readership are similar to those driving citation counts. However, the
   altmetric events differ from each other in terms of a small number of
   factors; for instance, institution prestige and country prestige
   associate with increased Mendeley readers and blog and news posts, but
   it is an insignificant factor for Twitter and Facebook posts. The
   findings contribute to the continued development of theoretical models
   and methodological developments associated with capturing, interpreting,
   and understanding altmetric events.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of the number of readers registered in the social reference
   manager Mendeley have been proposed as an early impact indicator for
   journal articles. Although previous research has shown that Mendeley
   reader counts for articles tend to have a strong positive correlation
   with synchronous citation counts after a few years, no previous studies
   have compared early Mendeley reader counts with later citation counts.
   In response, this first diachronic analysis compares reader counts
   within a month of publication with citation counts after 20 months for
   ten fields. There are moderate or strong correlations in eight out of
   ten fields, with the two exceptions being the smallest categories (n =
   18, 36) with wide confidence intervals. The correlations are higher than
   the correlations between later citations and early citations, showing
   that Mendeley reader counts are more useful early impact indicators than
   citation counts.}},

Abstract = {{Online media and especially social media are becoming more and more
   relevant to our everyday life. Reflecting this tendency in the
   scientific community, alternative metrics for measuring scholarly impact
   on the web are increasingly proposed, extending (or even replacing)
   traditional metrics (e.g., citations, journal impact factor, etc.). This
   paper explores the relationship between traditional metrics and
   alternative metrics for psychological research in the years from 2010 to
   2012. Traditional publication metrics (e.g., number of citations, impact
   factor) and alternative metrics (collected from Altmetric, a website
   that collects and counts references as they appear in Wikipedia, public
   policy documents, research blogs, mainstream media, or social networks)
   were extracted and compared, using a dataset of over 245,000
   publications from the Web of Science. Results show positive, small to
   medium, correlations on the level of individual publications, and
   frequently medium to high correlations on the level of research fields
   of Psychology. The more accumulated the level of analysis, the higher
   the correlations. These findings are fairly robust over time and
   comparable to findings from research areas other than Psychology.
   Additionally, a new metric, the Score Factor, is proposed as a useful
   alternative metric to assess a journal's impact in the online media.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives TRanslating Emergency Knowledge for Kids (TREKK) and Cochrane
   Child Health collaborate to develop knowledge products on paediatric
   emergency medicine topics. Via a targeted social media promotion, we
   aimed to increase user interaction with the TREKK and Cochrane Child
   Health Twitter accounts and the uptake of TREKK Bottom Line
   Recommendations (BLRs) and Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs).
   Design Quantitative descriptive evaluation.
   Setting We undertook this study and collected data via the internet.
   Participants Our target users included online healthcare providers and
   health consumers.
   Intervention For 16 weeks, we used Twitter accounts (@TREKKca and
   @Cochrane\_Child) and the Cochrane Child Health blog to promote 6 TREKK
   BLRs and 16 related Cochrane SRs. We published 1 blog post and 98
   image-based tweets per week.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was user
   interaction with @TREKKca and @Cochrane\_Child. Secondary outcomes were
   visits to TREKK's website and the Cochrane Child Health blog, clicks to
   and views of the TREKK BLRs, and Altmetric scores and downloads of
   Cochrane SRs.
   Results Followers to @TREKKca and OCochrane\_Child increased by 24\% and
   15\%, respectively. Monthly users of TREKK's website increased by 29\%.
   Clicks to the TREKK BLRs increased by 22\%. The BLRs accrued 59\% more
   views compared with the baseline period. The 16 blog posts accrued 28\%
   more views compared with the 8 previous months when no new posts were
   published. The Altmetric scores for the Cochrane SRs increased by AO
   points each. The mean number of full text downloads for the promotion
   period was higher for nine and lower for seven SRs compared with the
   16-week average for the previous year (mean difference (SD), +4.0
   (22.0\%)).
   Conclusions There was increased traffic to TREKK knowledge products and
   Cochrane SRs during the social media promotion. Quantitative evidence
   supports blogging and tweeting as dissemination strategies for
   evidence-based knowledge products.}},

Abstract = {{The reward system of science is undergoing significant changes, as
   traditional indicators compete with initiatives that offer novel means
   of disseminating and assessing scholarly impact. This article considers
   a number of aspects of this reward system, including authorship,
   citations, acknowledgements and the growing use of social media
   platforms by academics, with an eye towards identifying contemporary
   issues relating to scholarly communication practices, as understood
   through the perspectives of Bourdieu's symbolic capital and Merton's
   recognition framework. The article posits that, while scientific capital
   remains the foundation upon which the reward system of science is built,
   this system is revealing itself to be more and more multifaceted,
   extremely complex, and facing increasing tension between its traditional
   means of evaluation and the potential of new indicators in the digital
   era. The article presents an extended literature review, as well as
   recommendations for further consideration and empirical research. A
   better understanding of the perceptions of academics would be necessary
   to properly assess the effects of these new indicators on scholarly
   communication practices and the reward system of science.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetrics is complementary to the traditional bibliographic impact
   measurement techniques. This study explores the extent to which
   Altmetrics co-relate with the bibliographic impact measurement
   techniques: H-index and its variants. Analysis is accomplished based on
   around 70,000 published papers of 45categories from the field of
   mathematics. Number of tweets containing title, URL, or DOI of research
   papers has been compared with the H-index, G-index, HC-index, M-quotient
   and HW-index of the scholar. Analysis has been done for around 57,155
   authors and shows that with the very low twitter citation rate that is
   1.47\%, almost no correlation exists between Twitter citation data and
   conventional impact measurement techniques. It implies that the social
   media metrics (Altmetrics) does not reflect the same kind of metrics as
   bibliometric indices. It further implies that Altmetrics should also be
   considered along with bibliometric indices to access an author's
   popularity}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we address the question whether (and to what extent,
   respectively) altmetrics are related to the scientific quality of papers
   (as measured by peer assessments). Only a few studies have previously
   investigated the relationship between altmetrics and assessments by
   peers. In the first step, we analyse the underlying dimensions of
   measurement for traditional metrics (citation counts) and altmetrics by
   using principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). In
   the second step, we test the relationship between the dimensions and
   quality of papers (as measured by the post-publication peer-review
   system of F1000Prime assessments) using regression analysis. The results
   of the PCA and FA show that altmetrics operate along different
   dimensions, whereas Mendeley counts are related to citation counts, and
   tweets form a separate dimension. The results of the regression analysis
   indicate that citation-based metrics and readership counts are
   significantly more related to quality, than tweets. This result on the
   one hand questions the use of Twitter counts for research evaluation
   purposes and on the other hand indicates potential use of Mendeley
   reader counts.}},

Title = {{Academic information on Twitter: A user survey}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{Although counts of tweets citing academic papers are used as an informal
   indicator of interest, little is known about who tweets academic papers
   and who uses Twitter to find scholarly information. Without knowing
   this, it is difficult to draw useful conclusions from a publication
   being frequently tweeted. This study surveyed 1,912 users that have
   tweeted journal articles to ask about their scholarly-related Twitter
   uses. Almost half of the respondents (45\%) did not work in academia,
   despite the sample probably being biased towards academics. Twitter was
   used most by people with a social science or humanities background.
   People tend to leverage social ties on Twitter to find information
   rather than searching for relevant tweets. Twitter is used in academia
   to acquire and share real-time information and to develop connections
   with others. Motivations for using Twitter vary by discipline,
   occupation, and employment sector, but not much by gender. These factors
   also influence the sharing of different types of academic information.
   This study provides evidence that Twitter plays a significant role in
   the discovery of scholarly information and cross-disciplinary knowledge
   spreading. Most importantly, the large numbers of non-academic users
   support the claims of those using tweet counts as evidence for the
   non-academic impacts of scholarly research.}},

Abstract = {{The data collection and reporting approaches of four major altmetric
   data aggregators are studied. The main aim of this study is to
   understand how differences in social media tracking and data collection
   methodologies can have effects on the analytical use of altmetric data.
   For this purpose, discrepancies in the metrics across aggregators have
   been studied in order to understand how the methodological choices
   adopted by these aggregators can explain the discrepancies found. Our
   results show that different forms of accessing the data from diverse
   social media platforms, together with different approaches of
   collecting, processing, summarizing, and updating social media metrics
   cause substantial differences in the data and metrics offered by these
   aggregators. These results highlight the importance that methodological
   choices in the tracking, collecting, and reporting of altmetric data can
   have in the analytical value of the data. Some recommendations for
   altmetric users and data aggregators are proposed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The new web-based academic communication platforms do not only enable
   researchers to better advertise their academic outputs, making them more
   visible than ever before, but they also provide a wide supply of metrics
   to help authors better understand the impact their work is making. This
   study has three objectives: a) to analyse the uptake of some of the most
   popular platforms (Google Scholar Citations, ResearcherID, ResearchGate,
   Mendeley and Twitter) by a specific scientific community (bibliometrics,
   scientometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and altmetrics); b) to
   compare the metrics available from each platform; and c) to determine
   the meaning of all these new metrics. To do this, the data available in
   these platforms about a sample of 811 authors (researchers in
   bibliometrics for whom a public profile Google Scholar Citations was
   found) were extracted. A total of 31 metrics were analysed. The results
   show that a high number of the analysed researchers only had a profile
   in Google Scholar Citations (159), or only in Google Scholar Citations
   and Research Gate (142). Lastly, we find two kinds of metrics of online
   impact. First, metrics related to connectivity (followers), and second,
   all metrics associated to academic impact. This second group can further
   be divided into usage metrics (reads, views), and citation metrics. The
   results suggest that Google Scholar Citations is the source that
   provides more comprehensive citation-related data, whereas Twitter
   stands out in connectivity-related metrics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Academic and cultural heritage institutions around the world have made
   measurable strides in the development of digital sound archives oriented
   towards research and access, but their impact on scholarship and society
   has been little studied. Traditionally, impact has been measured by
   citations; yet these are problematic metrics for nontraditional outputs
   like sound recordings. Social media data provide a promising avenue of
   investigation for measuring scholarly as well as societal impact.
   Twitter in particular has been shown to provide a high number of
   references for cultural and research outputs in all disciplines. This
   study analyzes Twitter references pertaining to the collections of five
   digital sound archives: British Library Sounds, Europeana Sounds, the
   Internet Archive Audio Archive, PennSound, and UbuWeb. By using text
   analysis methods to identify high-frequency events and trends, and
   labeling them with a rubric designed for measuring the impact of digital
   heritage resources, this study provides preliminary insights on user
   values as they relate to digital sound collections. Despite the
   limitations of using social media data, the evidence gathered in this
   case study characterizes aspects of the use of digital sound
   collections, and may point to future priorities for the digital
   preservation of sound.}},

Abstract = {{The news media's citations of journals, authors, and papers have been
   used avant la letre to study the impact of science in the lay press and
   some characteristics of scientific journalism. In this paper, the
   concepts of press citation and media impact are outlined by analogy to
   those of scientific citation and scientific impact, establishing their
   similarities and differences. Some possibilities of study using press
   citations counts are also outlined, as well as the development of new
   bibliometric indicators to measure the media impact of science. The
   analysis of press citations has advantages over alternative metrics
   (altmetrics) because the press is the main news producer and offers a
   more consolidated product with a professional filter. However, press
   citations also have some limitations, mainly the lack of a database of
   press citations from scientific journals in the international lay press.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the structure of knowledge, the evolution of research
   topics, and the emergence of topics has always been an important part of
   information science (IS). Our previous scientometric review of IS
   provided a snapshot of this fast-growing field up to the end of 2008.
   This new study aims to identify emerging trends and new developments
   appearing in the subsequent 7574 articles published in 10 IS journals
   between 2009 and 2016, including 20,960 references. The results of a
   document co-citation analysis show great changes in the research topics
   in the IS domain. The positions of certain core topics found in the
   previous study, namely, information retrieval, webometrics, and citation
   behavior, have been replaced by scientometric indicators (H-index),
   citation analysis (citation performance and bibliometrics), scientific
   collaboration, and information behavior in the most recent period of
   2009-2016. Dual-map overlays of journals show that the knowledge base of
   IS research has shifted considerably since 2010, with emerging topics
   including scientific evaluation indicators, altmetrics, science mapping
   and visualization, bibliometrics, citation analysis, and scientific
   collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the impact of open-access (OA) articles published by China
   and the USA by using Web of Science (WoS) data covering a period of 5
   years (2011-2015), five indexes (citation and four altmetric indexes),
   five disciplines, and three types of articles. With regard to article
   type, Type I papers are those wherein the authors are all from China or
   the USA. Type II are those in which the first author is from China or
   the USA. Type III includes those in which the first author is not from
   China or the USA. We found that the proportion of OA papers in WoS has
   been growing in recent years. In terms of citations and altmetric
   indexes, the mean value of the USA is larger than that of China in
   general; Type II articles possess the highest value among all papers in
   the USA, whereas Type III has the highest value in China. Compared with
   the scenario in citations, social sciences and humanities possess larger
   altmetric values in China and the USA. The correlation among indicators
   is similar for the OA papers from China and the USA. Generally,
   citations cannot effectively represent the altmetric indexes. The gap
   between China and the USA is the largest in the altmetric attention
   score and Type I, and the smallest in citations and Type III. Measuring
   the international impact of OA papers using only citations
   underestimates the gap between China and the USA.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design: Observational study.
   Objectives: To determine the publication rate of podium presentations
   from the North American Spine Society (NASS) annual meetings from the
   years 2009 to 2011.
   Methods: In April 2015, a PubMed search was conducted using titles from
   the paper presentations as well as the authors. Of the search results
   that were found, the specific scientific journal in which the article
   was published was recorded. We analyzed further the top 4 destination
   journals and trends in publications in these journals over the study
   period. No study funding was obtained for this research, and there are
   no potential conflicts of interest or associated biases.
   Results: Over the study period, 671 paper presentations were available
   and 342 were published (51\% publication rate). The highest publication
   rate was from the 2011 annual meeting, with 55.3\%, and the lowest year
   was 2010, with a rate of 46.43\%. Spine (32.75\%), The Spine Journal
   (19.01\%), Journal of Neurosurgery Spine (7.31\%), and European Spine
   Journal (6.73\%) were the top 4 destination journals. Over the study
   period, we found a significant decrease in publication rate in Spine (P
   = .001) and a significant increase in publication rate in The Spine
   Journal (P = .003). There were no significant difference in publication
   rate over the study period in Journal of Neurosurgery Spine (P = .15) or
   European Spine Journal (P = .23).
   Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge evaluating the
   publication rate of podium presentations from recent North American
   Spine Society annual meetings. We found an overall publication rate of
   51\%.}},

Pages = {{717-729}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This article contains two investigations into Mendeley reader counts
   with the same dataset. Mendeley reader counts provide evidence of early
   scholarly impact for journal articles, but reflect the reading of a
   relatively young subset of all researchers. To investigate whether this
   age bias is constant or varies by narrow field and publication year,
   this article compares the proportions of student, researcher and faculty
   readers for articles published 1996-2016 in 36 large monodisciplinary
   journals. In these journals, undergraduates recorded the newest research
   and faculty the oldest, with large differences between journals. The
   existence of substantial differences in the composition of readers
   between related fields points to the need for caution when using
   Mendeley readers as substitutes for citations for broad fields. The
   second investigation shows, with the same data, that there are
   substantial differences between narrow fields in the time taken for
   Scopus citations to be as numerous as Mendeley readers. Thus, even
   narrow field differences can impact on the relative value of Mendeley
   compared to citation counts.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional citation-based indicators and activities on Online Social
   Media Platforms (OnSMP; e.g. Twitter) have been used to assess the
   impact of scientific research. However, the association between
   traditional indicators (i.e., number of citations and journal impact
   factor) and the new OnSMP metrics still deserve further investigations.
   Here, we used multivariate models to evaluate the relative influence of
   collaboration, time since publication and traditional indicators on the
   interest of 2863 papers published in five ecological journals from 2013
   to 2015 as given by nine OnSMP. We found that most activities were
   concentrated on Twitter and Mendeley and that activities in these two
   OnSMP are highly correlated. Our results indicate that traditional
   indicators explained most of the variation in OnSMP activity.
   Considering that OnSMP activities are high as soon as the articles are
   made available online, contrasting with the slow pace in which the
   citations are accumulated, our results support the use of activities on
   OnSMP as an early signal of research impact of ecological articles.}},

Abstract = {{Science communication is seen as critical for the disciplines of ecology
   and conservation, where research products are often used to shape policy
   and decision making. Scientists are increasing their online media
   communication, via social media and news. Such media engagement has been

   as citation rates. Here, we measure the association between citation
   rates and the Altrnetric Attention Score-an indicator of the amount and
   reach of the attention an article has received-along with other forms of
   bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact factor, and
   article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated
   with citation rates. However in recent years, we detected increasing
   media exposure did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier
   years; signalling a diminishing return on investment. Citations
   correlated with journal impact factors up to similar to 13, but then
   plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing citations does not require
   publishing in the highest impact journals. We conclude that ecology and
   conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research through
   social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance
   under traditional measures of scholarly activity.}},

Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{This study considered all articles published in six Public Library of
   Science (PLOS) journals in 2012 and Web of Science citations for these
   articles as of May 2015. A total of 2,406 articles were analyzed to
   examine the relationships between Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and
   Web of Science citations. The AAS for an article, provided by Altmetric
   aggregates activities surrounding research outputs in social media (news
   outlet mentions, tweets, blogs, Wikipedia, etc.). Spearman correlation
   testing was done on all articles and articles with AAS. Further analysis
   compared the stratified datasets based on percentile ranks of AAS: top
   50\%, top 25\%, top 10\%, and top 1\%. Comparisons across the six
   journals provided additional insights. The results show significant
   positive correlations between AAS and citations with varied strength for
   all articles and articles with AAS (or social media mentions), as well
   as for normalized AAS in the top 50\%, top 25\%, top 10\%, and top 1\%
   data sets. Four of the six PLOS journals, Genetics, Pathogens,
   Computational Biology, and Neglected Tropical Diseases, show significant
   positive correlations across all datasets. However, for the two journals
   with high impact factors, PLOS Biology and Medicine, the results are
   unexpected: the Medicine articles showed no significant correlations but
   the Biology articles tested positive for correlations with the whole
   dataset and the set with AAS. Both journals published substantially
   fewer articles than the other four journals. Further research to
   validate the AAS algorithm, adjust the weighting scheme, and include
   appropriate social media sources is needed to understand the potential
   uses and meaning of AAS in different contexts and its relationship to
   other metrics.}},

Title = {{Impact of Low Back Pain Clinical Trials Measured by the Altmetric Score:
   Cross-Sectional Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is interest from authors and publishers in sharing the
   results of their studies over the Internet in order to increase their
   readership. In this way, articles tend to be discussed and the impact of
   these articles tends to be increased. In order to measure this type of
   impact, a new score (named Altmetric) was created. Altmetric aims to
   understand the individual impact of each article through the attention
   attracted online.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study was to analyze potential
   factors related with the publishing journal and the publishing trial
   that could be associated with Altmetric scores on a random sample of low
   back pain randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The secondary objective
   of this study was to describe the characteristics of these trials and
   their Altmetric scores.
   Methods: We searched for all low back pain RCTs indexed on the
   Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro; www.pedro.org.au) published
   between 2010 and 2015. A total of 200 articles were randomly selected,
   and we extracted data related to the publishing trial, the publishing
   journal, methodological quality of the trials (measured by the 0-10 item
   PEDro scale), and total and individual scores of Altmetric mentioned and
   Altmetric reader. The study was a cross-sectional study, and
   multivariate regression models and descriptive statistics were used.
   Results: A total of four variables were associated with Altmetric
   mentioned score: impact factor (beta-coefficient=3.4 points), number of
   years since publication (beta-coefficient=-4.9 points), number of
   citations divided by years since publication (beta-coefficient=5.2
   points), and descriptive title (beta-coefficient=-29.4 points). Only one
   independent variable was associated with Altmetric reader score: number
   of citations divided by years since publication (beta-coefficient=10.1
   points, 95\% CI 7.74-12.46). We also found that the majority of articles
   were published in English, with a descriptive title, and published in
   open access journals endorsing the Consolidated Standards of Reporting
   Trials (CONSORT) statement.
   Conclusions: Researchers should preferably select high impact factor
   journals for submission and use declarative or interrogative titles, as
   these factors are likely to increase the visibility of their studies in
   social media.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the academic and societal impacts of the
   engineering electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) at the North-West
   University. The citation counts obtained through Google Scholar (GS) and
   the altmetrics data obtained from Dspace on the North-West University
   institutional repository are used to determine these impacts. Further,
   the conversion rates of ETDs from an educational output into an academic
   research output are determined using data from GS and the North-West
   University institutional repository. The results show that the 612
   theses and dissertations attracted 931 citations which translates to
   1.52 citations per thesis on average. A total of 41.2\% theses and
   dissertations received at least one citation and the conversion rate
   into academic research output was 16.8\%. The conversion rates in the
   last 3 years that are part of this research is 27.3\% which suggests an
   improvement. An average of 323 PDF views were received per thesis. The
   citation and PDF views data show that the Engineering ETDs have
   commendable academic and societal impacts. Nonetheless, the academic
   impacts show scant correlation with the societal impacts although some
   positive trends are noticeable when looking at the origin of PDF views
   and citations by country.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this work was to group altmetric indicators
   according to their relationships and detect disciplinary differences
   with regard to altmetric impact in a set of 3793 research articles

   (Altmetric, PlumX and Crossref Event Data) and Scopus were used to
   extract information about these publications and their metrics.
   Principal component analysis was used to summarize the information on
   these metrics and detect groups of indicators. The results show that
   these metrics can be grouped into three components: social media,
   gathering metrics from social networks and online media; usage,
   including metrics on downloads and views; and citations and saves,
   grouping metrics related to research impact and saves in bookmarking
   sites. With regard to disciplinary differences, articles in the General
   category attract more attention from social media, Social Sciences
   articles have higher usage than Physical Sciences, and General articles
   are more cited and saved than Health Sciences and Social Sciences

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the online visibility of the most popular
   orthodontic articles in Web platforms in relation to publication details
   and citations.
   Materials and Methods: Altmetric Explorer (Altmetric LLP, London, UK)
   was searched for articles published in 11 orthodontic journals without
   time limits in publication and citation on social media. The 200
   articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) were collected
   and screened for data related to publication (date, journal, access),
   authorship (number of authors, affiliation and origin of the
   corresponding author), and research (type, subject, funding). Citation
   counts were harvested from Scopus.
   Results: The top 200 articles presented a median AAS of 8.0 (range:
   5.0-196.0), and were mostly bookmarked in Mendeley (median: 16.6
   references; range: 0-199.0). American Journal of Orthodontics \&
   Dentofacial Orthopedics, European Journal of Orthodontics and The Angle
   Orthodontist contributed 86 per cent of the total number of research
   outputs. Studies investigating socio-demographics had significantly
   higher AAS compared to diagnostic studies (median AAS: 19.0; range:
   7.0-34.0; versus median AAS: 6.0; range: 5.0-10.0. No other study
   parameter was found to be statistically significant. AAS did not
   correlate to the number of citations as reported in Scopus.
   Limitations: The early stage of altmetrics and their complementary role
   in assessing together with the citation-based metrics the research
   impact need to be acknowledged in the interpretation of the results.
   Conclusions: Visibility of orthodontic articles on the Web is not
   significantly correlated with citations. Studies on socio-demographics
   had significantly higher number of online mentions. More constructive
   online presence of orthodontic journals is needed to reinforce
   dissemination of research data among scholars and non-scholars.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a new approach for analysing the ability of existing
   research metrics to identify research which has strongly influenced
   future developments. More specifically, we focus on the ability of
   citation counts and Mendeley reader counts to distinguish between
   publications regarded as seminal and publications regarded as literature
   reviews by field experts. The main motivation behind our research is to
   gain a better understanding of whether and how well the existing
   research metrics relate to research quality. For this experiment we have
   created a new dataset which we call TrueImpactDataset and which contains
   two types of publications, seminal papers and literature reviews. Using
   the dataset, we conduct a set of experiments to study how citation and
   reader counts perform in distinguishing these publication types,
   following the intuition that causing a change in a field signifies
   research quality. Our research shows that citation counts work better
   than a random baseline (by a margin of 10\%) in distinguishing important
   seminal research papers from literature reviews while Mendeley reader
   counts do not work better than the baseline.}},

Abstract = {{Metrics like the number of tweets or Mendeley readers are currently
   discussed as an alternative to evaluate research. These alternative
   metrics (altmetrics) still need to be evaluated in order to fully
   understand their meaning, their benefits and limitations. While several
   preceding studies concentrate on correlations of altmetrics with
   classical measures like citations, this study aims at investigating
   metric-compatibility within altmetrics. For this purpose, 5000 journal
   articles from six disciplines have been analyzed regarding their metrics
   with the help of the aggregators PlumX and Altmetric. com. For this set,
   the highest numbers of events have been recognized regarding Mendeley
   readers, followed by Twitter and Facebook mentions. Thereby variations
   considering the aggregators could be observed. Intra-correlations
   between the metrics across one aggregator have been calculated, as well
   as inter-correlations for the corresponding metrics across the
   aggregators. For both aggregators, low to medium intra-correlations
   could be calculated which shows the diversity of the different metrics.
   Regarding inter-correlations, PlumX and Altmetric. com are highly
   consistent concerning Mendeley readers (r = 0: 97) and Wikipedia
   mentions (r = 0: 82), whereas the consistency concerning Twitter (r = 0:
   49), blogs (r = 0: 46) and Reddit (r = 0: 41) is on a moderate level.
   The sources Facebook (r = 0: 29), Google+ (r = 0: 28) and News (r = 0:

Title = {{Perception of the importance of chemistry research papers and comparison

Abstract = {{Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived
   significance of their work with the citation count as the most
   commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have
   called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more
   nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate
   scientific research. To better understand the relationship between
   metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have
   conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of
   previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the
   Journal of the American Chemical Society published in 2003, respondents
   were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance
   and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations,
   most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among
   chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers
   to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of
   respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is
   markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the
   h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is
   conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose
   expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work
   performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and
   significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with
   chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of
   importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and
   that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that
   better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece
   of research.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In 2015 and 2016, the Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine
   (CJEM) Social Media (SoMe) Team collaborated with established medical
   websites to promote CJEM articles using podcasts and infographics while
   tracking dissemination and readership.
   Methods: CJEM publications in the ``Original Research{''} and ``State of
   the Art{''} sections were selected by the SoMe Team for podcast and
   infographic promotion based on their perceived interest to emergency
   physicians. A control group was composed retrospectively of articles
   from the 2015 and 2016 issues with the highest Altmetric score that
   received standard Facebook and Twitter promotions. Studies on SoMe
   topics were excluded. Dissemination was quantified by January 1, 2017
   Altmetric scores. Readership was measured by abstract and full-text
   views over a 3-month period. The number needed to view (NNV) was
   calculated by dividing abstract views by full-text views.
   Results: Twenty-nine of 88 articles that met inclusion were included in
   the podcast (6), infographic (11), and control (12) groups. Descriptive
   statistics (mean, 95\% confidence interval) were calculated for podcast
   (Altmetric: 61, 42-80; Abstract: 1795, 1135-2455; Full-text: 431,
   0-1031), infographic (Altmetric: 31.5, 19-43; Abstract: 590, 361-819;
   Full-text: 65, 33-98), and control (Altmetric: 12, 8-15; Abstract: 257,
   159-354; Full-Text: 73, 38-109) articles. The NNV was 4.2 for podcast,
   9.0 for infographic, and 3.5 for control articles.
   Discussion: Limitations included selection bias, the influence of SoMe
   promotion on the Altmetric scores, and a lack of generalizability to
   other journals.
   Conclusion: Collaboration with established SoMe websites using podcasts
   and infographics was associated with increased Altmetric scores and
   abstract views but not full-text article views.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Altmetrics is an area under construction, with a potential
   to study the impacts of academic products from social media data. It is
   believed that altmetrics can capture social and academic impacts, going
   beyond measures obtained using bibliometric and scientometric
   indicators. This research aimed to analyse aspects, characteristics and
   potentialities for the measuring of the social impact provided by
   altmetrics in social media.
   Method. 100 papers with higher altmetric scores were gathered from
   SciELO's database using the altmetric.com tool.
   Analysis. Profiles from individuals on Facebook and Twitter acting or
   reacting to the papers were analysed. These profiles were categorized as
   Social Impact and Academic Impact.
   Results. The results strongly indicate the impact measured using
   altmetrics greatly reproduces the scientist-to scientist relation, as do
   bibliometrics and scientometrics.
   Conclusion. The social impact measured by actions and interactions on
   Facebook and Twitter reach a significant 36\%, attesting the
   potentiality of altmetrics for measurement, in addition to the academic
   impact and the impact of scientific results in society.}},

   output. Based on online source metrics such as Mendeley book-marks, we
   evaluated multi-viewed impact of the top 50 academic institutions in the
   NI China. For the selection of multiple metrics, we investigated the
   presence and coverage of different kinds of online metrics, with a
   particular focus on their correlations with traditional citation-based
   metrics. In addition, Mendeley, Twitter, and Scopus are chosen as the
   complementary sources for multi-metrics. We sorted three ranks of the
   top 50 institutions in the NI China based on citation counts in Scopus,
   reader counts on Mendeley, and Twitter counts and we analyzed the
   differences among various ranking results. The diverse metrics revealed
   different aspects on institutions' academic impact.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a procedure to generate a snapshot of the
   structure of a specific scientific community and their outputs based on
   the information available in Google Scholar Citations (GSC). We call
   this method multifaceted analysis of disciplines through academic
   profiles (MADAP). The international community of researchers working in
   Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, Informetrics, Webometrics, and Altmetrics
   was selected as a case study. The records of the top 1000 most cited
   documents by these authors according to GSC were manually processed to
   fill any missing information and deduplicate fields like the journal
   titles and book publishers. The results suggest that it is feasible to
   use GSC and the MADAP method to produce an accurate depiction of the
   community of researchers working in Bibliometrics (both specialists and
   occasional researchers) and their publication habits (main publication
   venues such as journals and book publishers). Additionally, the wide
   document coverage of Google Scholar (specially books and book chapters)
   enables more comprehensive analyses of the documents published in a
   specific discipline than were previously possible with other citation
   indexes, finally shedding light on what until now had been a blind spot
   in most citation analyses.}},

Abstract = {{A data array of Russian publications for 2015 registered in the SCI-E DB
   was evaluated for the correlation between traditional bibliometrics and
   altmetrics. A special methodology based on the Kendall rank correlation
   coefficient was developed for this purpose. In the case of publications,
   the correlation between the citedness of a publication (the value of the
   TC field in the SCI-E DB) and its usage (fields U1 and U2) was
   evaluated. In the case of source journals for the indicated
   publications, the correlation was determined between the
   Cited\_Half-Life value and the values of journal-usage metrics, which
   were determined as the mean U1 (U2) value taken for all publications of
   the journal. It was established that the nature of journal distribution
   according to the Cited\_Half-Life value of the source journals for
   Russian publications practically coincides with the nature of the
   distribution of source journals for publications of the entire global
   flow: the Russian distribution shifted somewhat toward larger
   Cited\_Half-Life values (the median of the global distribution was 6.1,
   while that of the Russian distribution was 6.2). This shift increased
   sharply upon considering the number of Russian and global journal
   publications, respectively (the median of the global distribution was

Title = {{Alternative Metrics of Scholarly Output: The Relationship among
   Altmetric Score, Mendeley Reader Score, Citations, and Downloads in
   Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery}},
Journal = {{PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{801-809}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The impact of scholarly output is typically measured by the
   number of citations and, more recently, downloads. Newer metrics have
   been developed to reflect digital dissemination of knowledge such as the
   Altmetric and Mendeley reader scores. This article examines the
   relationship among citations, download rates, Altmetric scores, and
   Mendeley reader scores in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.
   Methods: The authors accessed the 55 most-cited articles published in
   Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery from 2014 to 2015. Altmetric scores,
   download rates, field-weighted citations, and Mendeley reader number
   were extracted. Correlation matrices were used to identify methodologies
   positively correlating between scores. The top-ranked articles were then
   collectively evaluated for central subject themes and unifying scoring
   methodologies.
   Results: The highest Altmetric score obtained was 159, the greatest
   number of citations was 52, and the greatest number of downloads was 41.
   There was no apparent correlation between Altmetric scores and Scopus
   citations (p = 0.58) or article subject themes (p = 0.63). Citation was
   positively associated with download rates (r = 0.31, p = 0.021) and
   Mendeley reader number (r = 0.46, p = 0.001). Mendeley reader number
   demonstrated high precision in identifying top-ranked citation articles
   (p = 0.044) despite its lack of direct association with Altmetric score
   (p = 0.83).
   Conclusions: With the growing public desire for evidence-based
   publications, our study quantifies the unique nature of Altmetric score
   while discouraging its use in isolation. Download rates are a more rapid
   measure of publication impact compared with citation number. Mendeley
   readership is also promising as an alternative index.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetrics from Altmetric.com are widely used by publishers and
   researchers to give earlier evidence of attention than citation counts.
   This article assesses whether Altmetric.com scores are reliable early
   indicators of likely future impact and whether they may also reflect
   non-scholarly impacts. A preliminary factor analysis suggests that the
   main altmetric indicator of scholarly impact is Mendeley reader counts,
   with weaker news, informational and social network discussion/promotion
   dimensions in some fields. Based on a regression analysis of
   Altmetric.com data from November 2015 and Scopus citation counts from
   October 2017 for articles in 30 narrow fields, only Mendeley reader
   counts are consistent predictors of future citation impact. Most other
   Altmetric.com scores can help predict future impact in some fields.
   Overall, the results confirm that early Altmetric.com scores can predict
   later citation counts, although less well than journal impact factors,
   and the optimal strategy is to consider both Altmetric.com scores and
   journal impact factors. Altmetric.com scores can also reflect dimensions
   of non-scholarly impact in some fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

   mean usage counts (U2) in a few research areas. We discovered a
   significant Kendall rank correlation between the citation metrics and

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Evaluate the use of Twitter by otolaryngology
   journals and determine the relationship between social media altmetrics
   and measures of academic impact.
   Study DesignCross-sectional analysis.
   Methods: Twitter profiles from the top 50 otolaryngology journals per
   2016 SCImago Journal \& Country Rank (SJR) were included. Twitter
   activity for each profile was calculated using Twitonomy analytics and
   Riffle software. Social media influence was measured using Klout scores.
   Annual SJR rank and H-Index scores between 2008 and 2016 were recorded
   for each journal. Associations between social media influence and
   academic indices were assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test, Spearman's
   rank order test, and Pearson correlation coefficients (alpha = .05).
   Results: Average SJR was 0.86 +/- 0.3 and H-Index was 50.9 +/- 24.
   Eighteen journals had Twitter profiles. Journals with social media
   accounts had significantly higher SJR (P = .03) and H-Index (P = .01)
   scores compared to those without. The average Klout score of Twitter
   profiles was 32.5 +/- 13. There was a significant association between a
   journal's Klout score and SJR rank (P = .004). Older Twitter profiles
   had higher Klout scores (P = .04). There was a direct relationship
   between a journal's total Twitter followers and H-Index score (P =
   .009), and a direct relationship between tweets and academic influence
   (P = .03 and .01 for SJR and H-Index, respectively).
   Conclusions: Social media is often underutilized and remains an untapped
   resource by many journals to increase readership and disseminate
   research. Journals with social media profiles had significantly higher
   academic metrics, and among journals with profiles, increased online
   activity was a predictor for academic influence. Future studies are
   warranted to elucidate causal relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objective: There is a pressing need to improve the ways
   in which the output of scientific research is evaluated by funding
   agencies, academic institutions, and other parties. To address this
   issue, a group of editors and publishers of scholarly journals met
   during the Annual Meeting of The American Society for Cell Biology
   (ASCB) in San Francisco, CA, on December 16, 2012. Method: The group
   developed a set of recommendations, referred to as the San Francisco
   Declaration on Research Assessment. Results and Discussion: The Journal
   Impact Factor is frequently used as the primary parameter with which to
   compare the scientific output of individuals and institutions. The
   Journal Impact Factor has a number of well-documented deficiencies as a
   tool for research assessment: citation distributions within journals are
   highly skewed; the properties of the Journal Impact Factor are
   field-specific: it is a composite of multiple, highly diverse article
   types, including primary research papers and reviews; Journal Impact
   Factors can be manipulated by editorial policy and data used to
   calculate the Journal Impact Factors are neither transparent nor openly
   available to the public. Our recommendations focus primarily on
   practices relating to research articles published in peer-reviewed
   journals but can and should be extended by recognizing additional
   products, such as datasets, as important research outputs. These
   recommendations are aimed at funding agencies, academic institutions,
   journals, organizations that supply metrics, and individual researchers.
   Conclusions: A number of themes run through these recommendations: the
   need to eliminate the use of journal-based metrics, such as Journal
   Impact Factors, in funding, appointment, and promotion considerations;
   the need to assess research on its own merits rather than on the basis
   of the journal in which the research is published; and the need to
   capitalize on the opportunities provided by online publication (such as
   relaxing unnecessary limits on the number of words, figures, and
   references in articles, and exploring new indicators of significance and
   impact).}},

Abstract = {{Academic librarians in sub-Saharan Africa, just like their counterparts
   in the rest of the world, are under pressure to provide relevant
   information services to satisfy varied client needs. Research
   administrators, grant offices, researchers, students and university
   managers, among others, are increasingly turning to academic librarians
   for information to meet their myriad research-related information and
   metrics needs. Sub-Saharan African countries' emphasis on strengthening
   science, technology and innovation has exerted further pressure on
   information professionals and other stakeholders to develop and
   appropriately apply bibliometrics and altmetrics to inform
   decision-making and policy-formulation processes. Research output and
   impact metrics are not only quickly evolving but their volume has been
   unprecedented. This paper's focus is the application of bibliometrics
   and altmetrics by academic librarians to support researchers in their
   respective universities. The paper argues that there is need for
   up-skilling or re-skilling the 21st-century sub-Saharan African academic
   librarian to select and apply appropriate metrics, tools and strategies
   to support researchers as they execute their responsibilities. The paper
   offers possible areas of training for academic librarians.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the capabilities,
   functionalities and appropriateness of Altmetric.com as a data source
   for the bibliometric analysis of books in comparison to PlumX.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors perform an exploratory analysis
   on the metrics the Altmetric Explorer for Institutions, platform offers
   for books. The authors use two distinct data sets of books. On the one
   hand, the authors analyze the Book Collection included in Altmetric.com.
   On the other hand, the authors use Clarivate's Master Book List, to
   analyze Altmetric.com's capabilities to download and merge data with
   external databases. Finally, the authors compare the findings with those
   obtained in a previous study performed in PlumX.
   Findings Altmetric.com combines and orderly tracks a set of data sources
   combined by DOI identifiers to retrieve metadata from books, being
   Google Books its main provider. It also retrieves information from
   commercial publishers and from some Open Access initiatives, including
   those led by university libraries, such as Harvard Library. We find
   issues with linkages between records and mentions or ISBN discrepancies.
   Furthermore, the authors find that automatic bots affect greatly
   Wikipedia mentions to books. The comparison with PlumX suggests that
   none of these tools provide a complete picture of the social attention
   generated by books and are rather complementary than comparable tools.
   Practical implications This study targets different audience which can
   benefit from the findings. First, bibliometricians and researchers who
   seek for alternative sources to develop bibliometric analyses of books,
   with a special focus on the Social Sciences and Humanities fields.
   Second, librarians and research managers who are the main clients to
   which these tools are directed. Third, Altmetric.com itself as well as
   other altmetric providers who might get a better understanding of the
   limitations users encounter and improve this promising tool.
   Originality/value This is the first study to analyze Altmetric.com's
   functionalities and capabilities for providing metric data for books and
   to compare results from this platform, with those obtained via PlumX.}},

   personnel) with a total of 48 components. An online survey was conducted
   with the repositories managers of 66 Spanish research institutions in
   order to verify the degree of fulfilment of the selected indicators.
   Findings The survey received forty-six responses, which represented a
   response rate of 69 per cent. Of these, 44 came from universities and
   two from research centres. In total, 65 per cent of the repositories
   have the capacity to import data from and export data to other
   university systems, mainly Current Research Information System (32 per
   cent). Most repositories have mechanisms for the large-scale import and
   export of metadata and digital objects (83 per cent). The use of
   altmetrics in repositories is widespread (44 per cent). Authors and
   librarians deposit most frequently (37 and 32 per cent, respectively),
   in spite of the fact that 44 per cent do not have full-time staff
   working in the repository. In more than 80 per cent of the repositories,
   between 90 and 100 per cent of the deposits are full-text documents.
   With respect to the tools used to promote the repository within the
   institution, these are primarily face-to-face training sessions (82 per
   cent), followed by support materials such as manuals and help pages (65
   per cent). The academic authorities encourage open access among
   researchers in 56 per cent of cases, a significant element in repository
   marketing.
   Originality/value This work proposes a model based on five dimensions
   and 48 indicators to assess institutional repositories. This approach
   has been applied to Spanish institutional repositories to provide
   up-to-date information about their management procedures and promotional
   methods and the services they offer authors and the university
   community. This overview of Spanish repositories has provided an insight
   into the way in which repositories have evolved in recent years and
   allowed potential improvements to be identified based on the most
   advanced repositories. This model can also be exported to assess
   institutional repositories in other countries.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted wide attention from
   researchers to address the potential of this technology in various
   industries recently. This study aims to investigate different
   characteristics of worldwide research on the IoT using bibliometrics,
   network analysis and altmetrics. Growth of the literature, publication
   types, languages, publication countries and research subjects are
   addressed. The scientific and social impact of the journal articles has
   also been examined using citation and altmetrics scores.
   Design/methodology/approach The Scopus database was searched for
   articles indexed under the terms Internet of Thing{*} or IoT or Internet
   of Everything{*} or Web of Thing{*}, and a total of 13,725 articles from
   2011 to 2016 were retrieved and analysed.
   Findings There was a continuous increase in the number of publications
   per year over the period, with a 6.7-fold rise in the number of
   publications, with the highest share of research output (4,989)
   published in 2016. Contribution of authors at the micro, meso and macro
   levels was analysed. About 89 per cent of total publications were the
   result of collaborative efforts, and Asia-Pacific was responsible for
   almost 53 per cent of world scientific production of IoT literature.
   Generally, the IoT research are found in publications concentrating on
   computer networks and communications, electrical and electronic
   engineering and computer science applications. The results also showed
   that the presence of IoT research on the social web is still low, with
   6.8 per cent of total publications presenting some altmetric activity.
   Research limitations/implications The work reported is limited to only
   Scopus-indexed publications. While the search methodology aimed to be as
   inclusive as possible, it may not have captured all scholarly research
   output in the IoT world.
   Practical implications The findings of this study may help researchers
   understand the performance of IoT research from across the world and
   suggest directions for further research.
   Originality/value This paper reviews the literature of the IoT in past
   five years using rigorous bibliometric, altmetric and network analysis
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, scholars focused their efforts in the domains of clinical
   care, research, and education; however, the last decade has witnessed
   the rise of novel areas of development such as innovation, quality
   improvement, informatics, and recently, digital scholarship. Academic
   institutions adapted and began considering these fields for academic
   promotion and tenure. Social media has become a critical space for the
   dissemination of knowledge and outreach to community and policy makers
   and also for the creation of communities of practice. This new realm
   brings multiple challenges, such as the appraisal of the quality and
   appropriateness of the content, the evaluation of impact on the academe
   and general populations, coupled to the creation of a system to reward
   scholars engaged in this novel endeavor. In this article, we describe
   the current state of academic promotion and the definition, nature, and
   merit of digital scholarship. We outline new strategies and tools for
   the assessment of dissemination and impact of these works, such as
   altmetrics, and finally, we reference innovative concepts on how to

Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{1065-1081}},
Abstract = {{Purpose By analyzing journal articles with high citation counts but low
   Twitter mentions and vice versa, the purpose of this paper is to provide
   an overall picture of differences between citation counts and Twitter
   mentions of academic articles.
   Design/methodology/approach Citation counts from the Web of Science and
   Twitter mentions of psychological articles under the Social Science
   Citation Index collection were collected for data analysis. An approach
   combining both statistical and simple content analysis was adopted to
   examine important factors contributing to citation counts and Twitter
   mentions, as well as the patterns of tweets mentioning academic
   articles.
   Findings Compared to citation counts, Twitter mentions have stronger
   affiliations with readability and accessibility of academic papers.
   Readability here was defined as the content size of articles and the
   usage of jargon and scientific expressions. In addition, Twitter
   activities, such as the use of hashtags and user mentions, could better
   facilitate the sharing of articles. Even though discussions of articles
   or related social phenomena were spotted in the contents of tweets,
   simple counts of Twitter mentions may not be reliable enough for
   research evaluations due to issues such as Twitter bots and a deficient
   understanding of Twitter users' motivations for mentioning academic
   articles on Twitter.
   Originality/value This study has elaborated on the differences between
   Twitter mentions and citation counts by comparing the characteristics of
   Twitter-inclined and citation-inclined articles. It provides useful
   information for interested parties who would like to adopt social web
   metrics such as Twitter mentions as traces of broader engagement with
   academic literature and potential suggestions to increase the
   reliability of Twitter metrics. In addition, it gives specific tips for
   researchers to increase research visibility and get attention from the
   general public on Twitter.}},

Abstract = {{Citation count is an important indicator for measuring research outputs.
   There have been numerous studies that have investigated factors
   affecting citation counts from the perspectives of cited papers and
   citing papers. In this paper, we focused specifically on citing papers
   and explored citations sourced from prestigious affiliations in the
   computer science discipline. The QS World University Rankings was
   employed to identify prestigious citations, named QS citations. We used
   the Microsoft Academic Graph, a massive scholarly dataset, and conducted
   different kinds of analysis between papers with QS citations and those
   without QS citations. We discovered that papers with QS citations are
   generally associated with higher total citation counts than those
   without QS citations. We extended the analysis to authors and journals,
   and the results indicated that when authors or journals have higher
   proportions of papers with QS citations, they are usually associated
   with higher values of the H-index or the Journal Impact Factor
   respectively. Additionally, papers with QS citations are also associated
   with a higher Altmetric Attention Score and a higher number of specific
   types of altmetrics such as tweet counts.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decades, CSCW research has undergone significant
   structural changes and has grown steadily with manifested differences
   from other fields in terms of theory building, methodology, and
   socio-technicality. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the
   scientific literature for mapping the intellectual structure of CSCW
   research and its scientific development over a 15-year period
   (2001-2015). A total of 1713 publications were subjected to examination
   in order to draw statistics and depict dynamic changes to shed new light
   upon the growth, spread, and collaboration of CSCW devoted outlets.
   Overall, our study characterizes top (cited and downloaded) papers,
   citation patterns, prominent authors and institutions, demographics,
   collaboration patterns, most frequent topic clusters and keywords, and
   social mentions by country, discipline, and professional status. The
   results highlight some areas of improvement for the field and a lot of
   well-established topics which are changing gradually with impact on
   citations and downloads. Statistical models reveal that the field is
   predominantly influenced by fundamental and highly recognized scientists
   and papers. A small number of papers without citations, the growth of
   the number of papers by year, and an average number of more than 39
   citations per paper in all venues ensure the field a healthy and
   evolving nature. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms
   of the influence of CSCW on the larger field of HCI.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) is an increasingly popular composite

   measure. We examined this issue empirically, by testing
   unidimensionality and the component structure congruence of the five

   reference point, these tests were also done on different citation data:
   WoS, Scopus, and Google Scholar. All tests were done for groups of
   articles with: (1) high citations, but lower AAS (HCGs), and (2) high
   AAS, but lower citations (HAGs). Changes in component structures over
   time (from 2016 to 2017) were also considered. Citation data
   consistently formed congruent unidimensional structures for all groups
   and over time. Altmetric data formed congruent unidimensional structures
   only for the HCGs, with much inconsistency for the HAGs (including
   change over time). The relationship between Twitter and News counts was
   shown to be curvilinear. It was not possible to obtain a satisfactory
   congruent and reliable linear unidimensional altmetric structure between
   the groups for any variable combination, even after Mendeley and
   CiteULike altmetric counts were included. Correlations of altmetric
   aggregates and citations were fairly inconsistent between the groups. We
   advise against the usage of composite altmetric measures (including the
   AAS) for any group comparison purposes, until the measurement invariance
   issues are dealt with. The underlying pattern of associations between
   individual altmetrics is likely too complex and inconsistent across
   conditions to justify them being simply aggregated into a single score.}},

Abstract = {{Books are an important source of knowledge to disseminate information.
   Researchers and academicians write books to propagate their innovative
   research or teachings amongst academic as well as non-academic audience.
   The number of books written every year is increasing rapidly. According
   to International Publisher Association (IPA) annual report 2015-2016,
   around 150 million different books were published worldwide in
   2014-2015. Many e-commerce websites are also involved in selling books.
   A recent addition to book publishing world is e-books, which have really
   made it very simple to publish. While, availability of large number of
   books is good for readers, at the same time it is challenging to find a
   good book, particularly in scholarly settings. Researchers in the area
   of Scientometrics have attempted to view assessment of goodness of a
   scholarly book by measuring citations that a book receive. However,
   citations alone are not a true measure of a book's impact. Many a times
   people use the knowledge in a book without actually citing it. Also use
   of books in classroom settings or for general reading often is not
   reflected in terms of citations. Therefore, it is important to obtain
   users's opinion about a book from other forms of data. Fortunately, we
   have now some data of this sort available in form of reviews, downloads
   and social media mentions etc. Amazon and Goodreads, both of which
   provide the readers' views about a book, are two good examples. This
   paper presents an exploratory research work on using these
   non-traditional data about books to assess impact of a book. A set of
   Scopus-indexed computer science books with good citations as well as
   some other popular books in computer science domain are used for
   analysis. The reviews of books have been crawled in an automated fashion
   from Amazon and Goodreads. Thereafter sentiment analysis is carried out
   the text of reviews. Results of sentiment analysis are compared and
   correlated with traditional impact assessment metrics. The experimental
   analysis does not show a coherent relationship between citation and
   online reviews. Also, majority of the online reviews are found to be
   positive for large number of books in the dataset. As a related
   exercise, the Scopus citation data and Google scholar citation data for
   books are also compared. A high value of correlation is observed in
   these two. Overall the exploratory analysis provides a useful insight
   into the problem of book impact assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Scholarly articles are considered one of the primary medium for
   dissemination of inventions and discoveries. Traditionally, usefulness
   and popularity of a scholarly article has been measured in terms of
   citations it receives. However, in the changed research publishing
   landscape, where most of the publications are now available in digital
   form accessible through various digital libraries; new measures of
   measuring usefulness of scholarly articles have emerged. Nowadays,
   scholarly articles are easily available for access and download from
   various digital access portals. The use and popularity of these digital
   access portals has also made it possible to integrate various social
   media platforms with journal access and use. Most of the journals now
   maintain statistics about reads, number of downloads, social profile
   shares etc. Several newer platforms like ResearchGate, Academia and
   Mendeley have also become popular. Researchers now often share their
   articles on various such platforms and also use social media channels to
   disseminate their article to a wider audience. This transformed
   environment has allowed to track and measure usefulness and popularity
   of scholarly articles through alternative metrics (now popularly known
   as Altmetrics) as compared to traditional citation impact measures.
   Altmetrics attempts to derive impact of a scholarly article by using
   data from different kinds such as social network share, mentions, tweets
   etc. The use of Altmetrics varies widely from country to country and
   discipline to discipline. This paper attempts to present findings of an
   exploratory analysis of relevance of Altmetrics data through a case
   study of scholarly articles from India published during 2016 and indexed
   in Web of Science and also updated on ResearchGate. The results obtained
   provide an interesting insight on relatedness and correlation of
   presence of scholarly articles in Web of Science and ResearchGate. It is
   observed that about 61\% papers indexed inWeb of Science have an entry
   in ResearchGate. There are, however, disciplinary variations in presence
   of articles in ResearchGate. Only about 61\% of the total disciplines in
   Web of Science are found to be covered in ResearchGate.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. It was proposed an altmetric index to identify the most
   consulted titles of Cuban publishers that distribute their contents on
   the e-Libro.com academic platform.
   Design/Methodology/Approach. The Wally Index is defined as the quotient
   of the Ln (\# queries) of a title between the maximum Ln (\# queries) of
   the set of titles evaluated in a defined period of time. The usefulness
   of this Index was validated from the study of the distribution of titles
   of six Cuban publishers that include their titles in the academic
   platform e-Libro.com, during the period September 2016 - August 2017.
   Results/Discussion. The Wally Index vs. \# Titles of Cuban publishers
   available on e-libro.com were adjusted to the power model, with a
   Pearson correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.7299, although titles with
   smaller numbers of queries showed greater dispersion, so that evaluated
   this index with the collection of the 226 most consulted titles. With
   this sample, the Wally Index normalized vs. ranking of the titles
   reached the value of the Pearson correlation coefficients R-2 = 0.8992
   with a logarithmic adjustment
   Conclusions. The use of the Wally Index is proposed for the evaluation
   of the queries of a set of titles, selected under specific criteria,
   available on Web platforms that provide data on the queries. The index
   is relative to the collection of titles and is independent of the number
   of queries.
   Originality/Value. The Wally Index can be used by any publisher who
   wants to examine the queries that receive their titles in the web
   environment.}},

   are used for their own benefit, this review is followed by a
   cross-metric validation study of the articles that concludes that
   altmetrics do not measure the authors' scientific impact, but they are

Abstract = {{More than 5 years after their emergence, altmetrics are still seen as a
   promise to complement traditional citation-based indicators. However, no
   study has focused on their potential usefulness to capture the impact of
   scholarly books. While recent literature shows that citation indicators
   cannot fully capture the impact of books, other studies have suggested
   alternative indicators such as usage, publishers' prestige or library
   holdings. In this paper, we calculate 18 indicators which range from
   altmetrics to library holdings, views, downloads or citations to the
   production of monographs of a Spanish university using the bibliometric
   suite PlumX from EBSCO. The objective of the study is to adopt a
   multidimensional perspective on the analysis of books and understand the
   level of complementarity between these different indicators. Also, we
   compare the overview offered by this range of indicators when applied to
   monographs with the traditional bibliometric perspective focused on
   journal articles and citation impact. We observe a low presence of
   altmetric indicators for monographs, even lower than for journal
   articles and a predominance of library holdings, confirming this
   indicator as the most promising one towards the analysis of the impact
   of books.}},

Pages = {{1721-1731}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Reader counts from the social reference sharing site Mendeley are known
   to be valuable for early research evaluation. They have strong
   correlations with citation counts for journal articles but appear about
   a year before them. There are disciplinary differences in the value of
   Mendeley reader counts but systematic evidence is needed at the level of
   narrow fields to reveal its extent. In response, this article compares
   Mendeley reader counts with Scopus citation counts for journal articles
   from 2012 in 325 narrow Scopus fields. Despite strong positive
   correlations in most fields, averaging 0.671, the correlations in some
   fields are as weak as 0.255. Technical reasons explain most weaker
   correlations, suggesting that the underlying relationship is almost
   always strong. The exceptions are caused by unusually high educational
   or professional use or topics of interest within countries that avoid
   Mendeley. The findings suggest that if care is taken then Mendeley
   reader counts can be used for early citation impact evidence in almost
   all fields and for related impact in some of the remainder. As an
   additional application of the results, cross-checking with Mendeley data
   can be used to identify indexing anomalies in citation databases.}},

   Bibliometric Analysis of the Scientific Discourse}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This bibliometric analysis deals with research on the collapse of the
   Maya civilizationa research topic with a long-lasting history, which has
   been boosted significantly by recent paleoclimatic research. The study
   is based on a publication set of 433 papers published between 1923 and
   2016. The publications covered by the Web of Science (WoS) show a
   significant increase since 1990, reaching about 30 papers per year at
   present. The results show that the current discourse on the collapse of
   the Maya civilization is focused on the role of climate as a major
   factor for the demise of this ancient civilization. The bibliometric
   analyses also reveal that (1) paleoclimatic records become numerous and
   are increasingly better dated; (2) the explanatory power of the records
   has been significantly increased by analyzing samples from regions
   closer to the relevant Maya sites; and (3) interdisciplinary cooperation
   of the humanities (archeology, anthropology, history) with natural
   sciences disciplines (geoscience, ecology, paleoclimatology,
   meteorology) seems to be highly promising. The collapse of the Maya
   civilization is a good example of how natural sciences entered research
   in the humanities and social sciences (anthropology, archeology,
   history) and boosted research (and solutions) around long-discussed, but
   unsolved questions.}},

Title = {{The Use of Twitter by Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery Journals: Twitter
   Activity, Impact Factor, and Alternative Metrics}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Social media (SoMe) platforms have become leading methods of
   communication and dissemination of scientific information in the medical
   community. They allow for immediate discussion and widespread engagement
   around important topics. It has been hypothesized that the activity on
   Twitter positively correlates with highly cited articles. The purpose of
   this study was to analyze the prevalence and activity of Trauma and
   Orthopaedic Surgery journals on Twitter, with the hypothesis that impact
   factor is positively associated with Twitter usage.
   Methods
   The top 50 Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals, ranked by 2016
   Impact Factor were analyzed. The Twitter profiles of each journal or
   affiliated society were identified. Other SoMe platforms used were also
   recorded. Twitonomy software (Digonomy Pty Ltd, New South Wales,
   Australia) was used to analyze the Twitter profiles over a one-year
   period. Twitter Klout Scores were recorded for each journal to
   approximate the SoMe influence. Altmetric Scores (the total number of
   mentions via alternative metrics) were also recorded. Statistical
   analysis was carried out to identify correlations between journal Impact
   Factors, SoMe activity, Twitter Klout Scores and Altmetric Scores.
   Results
   Twenty-two journals (44\%) had dedicated Twitter profiles. Fourteen
   journals (28\%) were associated with societies that had profiles and 14
   journals (28\%) had no Twitter presence. The mean Impact Factor overall
   was 2.16 +/- 0.14 (range, 1.07-5.16). The journals with dedicated
   Twitter profiles had higher Impact Factors than those without (mean 2.41
   vs. 1.61; P=0.005). A greater number of Twitter followers were
   associated with higher Impact Factors (R2 0.317, P=0.03). Journals with
   higher Twitter Klout Scores had higher Impact Factors (R2 0.357,
   P=0.016). Altmetric Score was positively associated with Impact Factor
   (R2 0.310, P=0.015). Journals with higher numbers of retweets (virtual
   citations in the Twittersphere) had higher Altmetric Scores (R2 0.463,
   P=0.015).
   Conclusion
   Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals with dedicated Twitter profiles
   have higher Impact Factors than those without. Altmetrics is likely to
   play a significant role in the literature evaluation going forward along
   with the traditional metrics. The engagement with Twitter by Trauma and
   Orthopaedic surgeons should be encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of online tools to communicate scientific research
   raises the important question of whether online attention is associated
   with citations in the scholarly literature. The Altmetric Attention
   Score (AAS) quantifies the attention received by a scientific
   publication on various online platforms including news, blogs and social
   media. It has been advanced as a rapid way of gauging the impact of a
   piece of research, both in terms of potential future scholarly citations
   and wider online engagement. Here, we explore variation in the AAS of
   2677 research articles published in 10 ornithological journals between
   2012 and 2016. On average, AAS increased sevenfold in just five years,
   primarily due to increased activity on Twitter which contributed 75\% of
   the total score. For a subset of 878 articles published in 2014,
   including an additional 323 ornithology articles from non-specialist
   journals, an increase in AAS from 1 to 20 resulted in a predicted 112\%
   increase in citation count from 2.6 to 5.5 citations per article. This
   effect interacted with journal impact factor, with weaker effects of AAS
   in higher impact factor journals. Our results suggest that altmetrics
   (or the online activity they measure), as well as complementing
   traditional measures of scholarly impact in ornithology such as
   citations, may also anticipate or even drive them.}},

   published by the University of Zagreb School of Medicine in
   internationally visible journals and to identify differences in
   altmetric activity between the papers published in international and
   local journals and between those published in English and Croatian. We
   also investigated changes in altmetric activity over time and the
   characteristics of papers with the highest Twitter and Mendeley
   activity.
   The sample included 390 papers collected from the bibliographic database
   Scopus. Their altmetric and citation activities were measured at three
   time points: in July 2014, 2015, and 2016.
   The findings generally correspond to those observed in the large-scale
   studies of medical papers. Papers in renowned journals, and papers
   reporting clinical guidelines and multicentric studies had the most
   intense altmetric activity. In contrast, papers published in local,
   Croatian journals showed minimal altmetric activity, especially the
   papers published in Croatian. These results indicate that the local
   publishing community has not yet recognised social media as a tool for
   promoting research and that non-English language publications have
   minimal chances to receive attention, even in social media.
   The evaluative potential of altmetric indicators has to be further

Abstract = {{This paper measures social media activities of 15 broad scientific
   disciplines indexed in Scopus database using Altmetric.com data. First,
   the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database is investigated,
   overall and across disciplines. Second, a zero-truncated negative
   binomial model is used to determine the association of various factors
   with increasing or decreasing citations. Lastly, the effectiveness of
   altmetric indices to identify publications with high citation impact is
   comprehensively evaluated by deploying area under the curve (AUC)-an
   application of receiver operating characteristic. Results indicate a
   rapid increase in the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database
   from 10.19\% in 2011 to 20.46\% in 2015. It was found that Blog count
   was the most important factor in the field of Health Professions and
   Nursing as it increased the number of citations by 38.6\%, followed by
   Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8\% in the field of
   Physics and Astronomy. The results of receiver operating characteristic
   show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate
   highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC = 0.725 between
   highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo identify the most discussed dental articles on the Web and
   to assess the association between the intensity of online attention,
   publication characteristics, and citations.
   Materials and methodsAn Altmetric Explorer search was conducted for
   articles published in the 91 dental journals included in 2015 InCites
   Journal Citation Report((R)) and mentioned online at all times. The 100
   articles with the highest online attention, as measured by the Altmetric
   Attention Score (AAS), were screened for journal title, quartile of
   impact factor distribution (Q1-Q4), publication date, origin and
   affiliation of first author, article topic, type, and access. Citation
   counts were harvested from Scopus.
   ResultsThe top 100 articles presented a median AAS of 119 and were
   mostly discussed on news outlets, Twitter, and Mendeley. Forty-one
   articles were published in Q1 journals, 24 in Q2 journals, 32 in Q3
   journals, and three in Q4 journals. AAS was significantly higher in
   articles of Q2 journals (median AAS=398, range=70-513) than in articles
   of Q1. A weak reverse correlation existed between AAS and time since
   publication (r=-.25, p<.05). No correlation was detected between AAS and
   other publication characteristics or number of citations.
   ConclusionsIncreased social impact of dental articles is not
   significantly associated with high citation rates.}},

Abstract = {{Research policy makers, funding agencies, universities and government
   organizations evaluate research output or impact based on the
   traditional citation count, peer review, h-index and journal impact
   factors. These impact measures also known as bibliometric indicators are
   limited to the academic community and cannot provide the broad
   perspective of research impact in public, government or business. The
   understanding that scholarly impact outside scientific and academic
   sphere has given rise to an area of scientometrics called alternative
   metrics or ``altmetrics.'' Moreover, researchers in this area incline to
   center around gauging scientific activity via social media, namely
   Twitter. However, these count-based measurements of impact are sensitive
   to gaming as they lack concrete references to the primary source. In
   this work, we expand a conventional citation graph to a heterogeneous
   graph of publications, scientists, venues, organizations based on more
   reliable social media sources such as mainstream news and weblogs. Our
   method is composed of two components: the first one is combining the
   bibliometric data with social media data like blogs and mainstream news.
   The second component investigates how standard graph-based metrics can
   be applied to a heterogeneous graph to predict the academic impact. Our
   result showed moderate correlations and positive associations between
   the computed graph-based metrics with academic impact and also
   reasonably predict the academic impact of researchers.}},

Abstract = {{During a week-long celebration of science, run under the federally
   supported National Science Week umbrella, the Catch a Rising Star: women
   in Queensland research (CaRS) programme flew scientists who identify as
   women to nine regional and remote communities in the Australian State of
   Queensland. The aim of the project was twofold: first, to bring science
   to remote and regional communities in a large, economically diverse
   state; and second, to determine whether media and public engagement
   provides career advancement opportunities for women scientists. This
   paper focuses on the latter goal. The data show: (i) a substantial
   majority (greater than 80\%) of researchers thought the training and
   experience provided by the programme would help develop her career as a
   research scientist in the future, (ii) the majority (65\%) thought the
   programme would help relate her research to end users, industry partners
   or stakeholders in the future, and (iii) analytics can help create a
   compelling narrative around engagement metrics and help to quantify
   influence. During the week-long project, scientists reached 600 000
   impressions on one social media platform (Twitter) using a program
   hashtag. The breadth and depth of the project outcomes indicate funding
   bodies and employers could use similar data as an informative source of
   metrics to support hiring and promotion decisions. Although this project
   focused on researchers who identify as women, the lessons learned are
   applicable to researchers representing a diverse range of backgrounds.
   Future surveys will help determine whether the CaRS programme provided
   long-term career advantages to participating scientists and communities.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   To complement traditional citation-based metrics, which take years to
   accrue and indicate only academic attention, academia has begun
   considering altmetrics or alternative metrics, which provide timely
   feedback on an article's impact by tracking its dissemination via
   nontraditional outlets, such as blogs and social media, across
   audiences. This article describes altmetrics and examines altmetrics
   attention, outlets used, and top article characteristics for health
   professions education (HPE) research.
   Method
   Using Altmetric Explorer, a tool to search altmetrics activity, the
   authors searched for HPE articles that had at least one altmetrics event
   (e.g., an article was tweeted or featured in a news story) between 2011
   and 2015. Retrieved articles were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
   In addition, the 10 articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Scores
   were identified and their key characteristics extracted.
   Results
   The authors analyzed 6,265 articles with at least one altmetrics event
   from 13 journals. Articles appeared in 14 altmetrics outlets. Mendeley
   (161,470 saves), Twitter (37,537 tweets), and Facebook (1,650 posts)
   were most popular. The number of HPE articles with altmetrics attention
   increased 145\%, from 539 published in 2011 to 1,321 in 2015. In 2015,
   50\% or more of the articles in 5 journals received altmetrics
   attention. Themes for articles with the most altmetrics attention
   included social media or social networking; three such articles were
   written as tips or guides.
   Conclusions
   Increasing altmetrics attention signals interest in HPE research and the
   need for further investigation. Knowledge of popular and underused
   outlets may help investigators strategically share research for broader
   dissemination.}},

   which are both necessary for moving up the academic ladder. Such
   behavior is likely to increase, given the recent explosive rise in
   popularity of web-based citation analysis tools (Web of Science, Google
   Scholar, Scopus, and Altmetric) that rank research performance. Here, we
   argue for new metrics centered on transparency to help curb this form of
   self-promotion that, if left unchecked, can have a negative impact on
   the scientific workforce, the way that we publish new knowledge, and
   ultimately the course of scientific advance.}},

Title = {{Social Media for the Dissemination of Cochrane Child Health Evidence:
   Evaluation Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Health care providers value ready access to reliable
   synthesized information to support point-of-care decision making.
   Web-based communities, facilitated by the adoption of social media tools
   such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are increasingly being used for
   knowledge dissemination, bridging the gap between knowledge generation
   and synthesis and knowledge implementation.
   Objective: Our objective was to implement and evaluate a structured
   social media strategy, using multiple platforms, to disseminate Cochrane
   Child Health evidence to health care providers caring for children.
   Methods: Our social media strategy had three components: daily
   ``tweets{''} using the Cochrane Child Health Twitter account, weekly
   WordPress blog posts, and a monthly journal club on Twitter ({''}tweet
   chat{''}). Each tweet, blog, and journal club shared Cochrane evidence
   on a child health topic. We evaluated the strategy through (1) Twitter
   and blog site analytics, (2) traceable link (Bitly) statistics, (3)
   Altmetric. com scores for promoted evidence, and (4) participant
   feedback. We also tracked the resources required to write the blog,
   tweet content, and manage the strategy.
   Results: The 22-week social media strategy ran between November 2014 and
   April 2015. We created 25 blog posts, sent 585 tweets, and hosted 3
   tweet chats. Monthly blog visits and views and Twitter account followers
   increased over time. During the study period, the blog received 2555
   visitors and 3967 page views from a geographically diverse audience of
   health care providers, academics, and health care organizations. In
   total, 183 traceable Bitly links received 3463 clicks, and the Twitter
   account gained 469 new followers. The most visited and viewed blog posts
   included gastrointestinal topics (lactose avoidance), research on
   respiratory conditions (honey for cough and treatments for asthma), and
   maternal newborn care (skin-to-skin contact). On Twitter, popular topics
   were related to public health (vaccination) and pain management. We
   collected Altmetric. com scores for 61 studies promoted during the study
   period and recorded an average increase of 11 points. Research staff (n=
   3) contributed approximately 433 hours to promotion activities and
   planning (6.5 hours each per week) to implement the social media
   strategy, and study investigators reviewed all content (blog posts and
   tweets).
   Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence on the use of a
   coordinated social media strategy for the dissemination of evidence to
   professionals providing health services to children and youth. The
   results and lessons learned from our study provide guidance for future
   knowledge dissemination activities using social media tools.}},

Abstract = {{Ours will be the generation proud to say we shifted the sands of

   sharing, and watering grassroots research in resource-compromised
   environments. Universal ``social{''} media is defining features of
   modern professional life that provide powerful modes of knowledge
   acquisition/sharing to that end. Altmetric and other measurements
   stratify academic communications according to this alternate, online
   media presence (not academic penetrance). Are they meaningless,
   self-absorbed integers, or reliable yardsticks of scientific and
   educational prowess? Far beyond this trite, patronizing question from
   the minds of outdated, terrified technophobes, the real impact of
   ``social{''} media is not narcissistic solipsism. Instant dissemination
   of contemporary surgical controversies on a truly global level drives
   improved (or at least reflective) health care for all. While a numerical
   assignment of value according to views, ``likes,{''} impressions, or
   ``retweets{''} may seem meaningless to cynical, established academics,
   the impetus for universal improvement is self-evident. Electronic data
   and opinion sharing may not balance the inequity between low- and
   high-income countries, but it keeps it in perspective. The best way to
   shift desert sands is to blow on them constantly.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of a representative scientific workforce is a challenge being
   addressed by federal agencies, funding bodies, and research institutes.
   As organizational units emphasize the work of training, recruiting,
   retaining, and promoting an inclusive scientific body, issues around
   bias and metrics appear frequently in the literature. The goal of this
   manuscript is to introduce some of the most commonly misunderstood areas
   of bias, and ways to adjust hiring and promotion practices; and to focus
   on innovative ways to quantify scientific outputs through metrics other
   than journal impact factors and paper citation numbers. These
   alternative metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly reliable predictors
   of impact for a scientific community that is asked to engage more
   frequently and more effectively with the public. Additionally, we
   address discipline-specific concerns around metrics used for hiring and
   promotion in biosecurity and biosafety, taxonomy, and researchers in
   government and regulatory roles. We conclude that in the future,
   societal and scholarly impact will be more closely tied. This is a
   critical time to ensure scientists are adequately trained and recognized
   for their contributions as public intellectuals, and supported in this
   important work.}},

Journal = {{BJU INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{441-454}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess whether a correlation exists between newsworthiness (Altmetric
   score) and scientific impact markers, such as citation analysis, impact
   factors, and levels of evidence.
   Methods
   The top five most cited articles for the year 2014 and 2015 from the top
   10 ranking urology journals (Scientific Impact Group) were identified.
   The top 50 articles each in 2014 and 2015 were identified from Altmetric
   support based on media activity (Media Impact Group). We determined the
   number of citations that these articles received in the scientific
   literature, and calculated correlations between citations with Altmetric
   scores.
   Results
   In the Scientific Impact Group, the mean number of citations per article
   was 37.6, and the most highly cited articles were oncology guidelines.
   The mean Altmetric score in these articles was 14.8. There was a weak
   positive correlation between citations and Altmetric score (r(s) = 0.35,
   95\% confidence interval 0.16-0.52, P < 0.001). In the Media Impact
   Group, the mean Altmetric score was 121.1 and most widely shared
   articles all related to sexual medicine. In this group, the mean number
   of citations was 9.7 and there was a weak negative correlation between
   Altmetric score and citations (r(s) = -0.20, P = 0.046).
   Conclusion
   The top articles based on Altmetric scores were not highly cited,
   suggesting that publications receiving the most media attention may not
   be the most scientifically rigorous, or that this audience places
   greater value on different subjects than the scientific community.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to study the relationship between the design and
   content of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and the subsequent number
   of citations in the medical literature and attention in online news and
   social media. We studied RCTs published during 2014 in five highly cited
   medical journals. This was a retrospective review focusing on
   characteristics of the individual trials and measures of citation and
   lay media attention. Primary outcome measures included citation count
   and Altmetric((R)) scores (a composite score measuring attention in
   news, blogs, Twitter((R)), and Facebook((R))). Two hundred and forty two
   RCTs were included in the final analysis. Trial characteristics that
   were positive predictors of citation count included investigation of
   Hepatitis C treatment (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), private funding (r = 0.24,
   p < 0.001), mortality-related endpoint (r = 0.22, p < 0.001), and
   research setting within the United States (r = 0.13, p < 0.001). The
   trial characteristic that positively predicted Altmetric score was the
   population size potentially affected (r = 0.39, p < 0.001). The only
   negative predictor of citation count was the size of the population
   potentially affected (r = -0.21, p < 0.001). Negative predictors of the
   Altmetric score included investigation of Hepatitis C treatment (r =
   -0.21, p < 0.001) and private funding (r = -0.13, p < 0.001). While
   correlation magnitudes were weak, the predictors of biomedical
   literature citation and non-academic media coverage were different.
   These predictors may affect editorial decisions and, given the rising
   influence of health journalism, further study is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of China has set forth
   ambitious goals, as part of its Citation Impact Upgrading Plan (CIUP),
   to fortify the standing of Chinese academics as well as Chinese academic
   journals. At present, MOST primarily considers Clarivate Analytics
   journal impact factor (JIF), which is a proprietary scientometric
   measure, as a measure of ``quality{''}. Academic publishing is however,
   starting to move away from metrics such as the JIF that can be gamed,
   and that do not truly reflect the academic worth of individual
   scientists, or of journals. Metrics such as altmetrics, which show the
   paper's popularity among social media, or a greater balance of metrics,
   to buffer the monopolized impact of the JIF on metrics-based rewards
   systems, may be issues that China and MOST need to consider as global
   academic publishing tends towards a state of open science where open
   access journals that reach a wider audience may have greater value than
   journals with a high JIF. Not only are China's academics well-funded by
   the state, the Chinese academic market is a highly coveted market by
   publishers and other parties interested in advancing their academic or
   commercial interests. Given the current fluid and rapidly evolving state
   of academic publishing, and the fairly rigid JIF-based rewards system in
   place in China at the moment, coupled with a recent spate in academic
   misconduct from Chinese researchers, this letter offers some suggestions
   as to the need for China to rethink its policies regarding what factors
   influence academic rewards.}},

Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Enthusiasm for using Twitter as a source of data in the social sciences
   extends to measuring the impact of research with Twitter data being a
   key component in the new altmetrics approach. In this paper, we examine
   tweets containing links to research articles in the field of dentistry
   to assess the extent to which tweeting about scientific papers signifies
   engagement with, attention to, or consumption of scientific literature.
   The main goal is to better comprehend the role Twitter plays in
   scholarly communication and the potential value of tweet counts as
   traces of broader engagement with scientific literature. In particular,
   the pattern of tweeting to the top ten most tweeted scientific dental
   articles and of tweeting by accounts is examined. The ideal that
   tweeting about scholarly articles represents curating and informing
   about state-of-the-art appears not to be realized in practice. We see
   much presumably human tweeting almost entirely mechanical and devoid of
   original thought, no evidence of conversation, tweets generated by
   monomania, duplicate tweeting from many accounts under centralized
   professional management and tweets generated by bots. Some accounts
   exemplify the ideal, but they represent less than 10\% of tweets.
   Therefore, any conclusions drawn from twitter data is swamped by the
   mechanical nature of the bulk of tweeting behavior. In light of these
   results, we discuss the compatibility of Twitter with the research
   enterprise as well as some of the financial incentives behind these
   patterns.}},

Title = {{Analysing researchers' outreach efforts and the association with
   publication metrics: A case study of Kudos}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{With the growth of scholarly collaboration networks and social
   communication platforms, members of the scholarly community are
   experimenting with their approach to disseminating research outputs, in
   an effort to increase their audience and outreach. However, from a
   researcher's point of view, it is difficult to determine whether efforts
   to make work more visible are worthwhile (in terms of the association
   with publication metrics) and within that, difficult to assess which
   platform or network is most effective for sharing work and connecting to
   a wider audience. We undertook a case study of Kudos
   (https://www.growkudos.com), a web-based service that claims to help
   researchers increase the outreach of their publications, to examine the
   most effective tools for sharing publications online, and to investigate
   which actions are associated with improved metrics. We extracted a
   dataset from Kudos of 830,565 unique publications claimed by authors,
   for which 20,775 had actions taken to explain or share via Kudos, and
   for 4,867 of these full text download data from publishers was
   available. Findings show that researchers are most likely to share their
   work on Face-book, but links shared on Twitter are more likely to be
   clicked on. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that a treatment group
   (publications having actions in Kudos) had a significantly higher median
   average of 149 full text downloads (23.1\% more) per publication as
   compared to a control group (having no actions in Kudos) with a median
   average of 121 full text downloads per publication. These findings
   suggest that performing actions on publications, such as sharing,
   explaining, or enriching, could help to increase the number of full text
   downloads of a publication.}},

Abstract = {{SlideShare is a free social website that aims to help users distribute
   and find presentations. Owned by LinkedIn since 2012, it targets a
   professional audience but may give value to scholarship through creating
   a long-term record of the content of talks. This article tests this
   hypothesis by analyzing sets of general and scholarly related SlideShare
   documents using content and citation analysis and popularity statistics
   reported on the site. The results suggest that academics, students, and
   teachers are a minority of SlideShare uploaders, especially since 2010,
   with most documents not being directly related to scholarship or
   teaching. About two thirds of uploaded SlideShare documents are
   presentation slides, with the remainder often being files associated
   with presentations or video recordings of talks. SlideShare is therefore
   a presentation-centered site with a predominantly professional user
   base. Although a minority of the uploaded SlideShare documents are cited
   by, or cite, academic publications, probably too few articles are cited
   by SlideShare to consider extracting SlideShare citations for research
   evaluation. Nevertheless, scholars should consider SlideShare to be a
   potential source of academic and nonacademic information, particularly
   in library and information science, education, and business.}},

   show that in March 2017, ResearchGate found less citations than did
   Google Scholar but more than both Web of Science and Scopus. This held
   true for the dataset overall and for the six largest journals in it.
   ResearchGate correlated most strongly with Google Scholar citations,

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Emerging alternative metrics leverage social
   media and other online platforms to provide immediate measures of
   biomedical articles' reach among diverse public audiences. We aimed to
   compare traditional citation and alternative impact metrics for articles
   in popular general radiology journals.
   Materials and Methods: All 892 original investigations published in 2013
   issues of Academic Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, Journal
   of the American College of Radiology, and Radiology were included. Each
   article's content was classified as imaging vs nonimaging. Traditional
   journal citations to articles were obtained from Web of Science. Each
   article's Altmetric Attention Score (Altmetric), representing weighted
   mentions across a variety of online platforms, was obtained from
   Altmetric.com. Statistical assessment included the McNemar test, the
   Mann-Whitney test, and the Pearson correlation.
   Results: Mean and median traditional citation counts were 10.7 +/- 15.4
   and 5 vs 3.3 +/- 13.3 and 0 for Altmetric. Among all articles, 96.4\%
   had traditional citation vs 41.8\% for Altmetric (P < 0.001). Online
   platforms for which at least 5\% of the articles were represented
   included Mendeley (42.8\%), Twitter (34.2\%), Facebook (10.7\%), and
   news outlets (8.4\%). Citations and Altmetric were weakly correlated (r
   = 0.20), with only a 25.0\% overlap in terms of articles within their
   top 10th percentiles. Traditional citations were higher for articles
   with imaging vs nonimaging content (11.5 +/- 16.2 vs 6.9 +/- 9.8, P <
   0.001), but Altmetric scores were higher in articles with nonimaging
   content (5.1 +/- 11.1 vs 2.8 +/- 13.7, P = 0.006).
   Conclusions: Although overall online attention to radiology journal
   content was low, alternative metrics exhibited unique trends,
   particularly for nonclinical articles, and may provide a complementary
   measure of radiology research impact compared to traditional citation
   counts.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we examined who tweeted academic articles that had at

   analysis, we studied the data using research techniques such as keyword
   categorization, co-word analysis and content analysis of user profile
   descriptions. Our results show that contrary to a random sample of
   Twitter users, users who tweet academic articles describe themselves
   more factually and by emphasizing their occupational expertise rather
   than personal interests. The more field-specific the articles were, the
   more research-related descriptions dominated in Twitter profile
   descriptions. We also found that scientific articles were tweeted to
   promote ideological views especially in instances where the article
   represented a topic that divides general opinion.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of Mendeley readers may give useful evidence about the impact of
   published research. Although previous studies have found significant
   positive correlations between counts of Mendeley readers and citation
   counts for journal articles, it is not known if this is equally true for

   citation counts were extracted for both journal articles and conference
   papers published in 2011 in four fields for which conferences are
   important: Computer Science Applications; Computer Software; Building
   and Construction Engineering; and Industrial and Manufacturing
   Engineering. Mendeley readership counts correlated moderately with
   citation counts for both journal articles and conference papers in
   Computer Science Applications and Computer Software. The correlations
   were much lower between Mendeley readers and citation counts for
   conference papers than for journal articles in Building \& Construction
   Engineering and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Hence, there
   seem to be disciplinary differences in the usefulness of Mendeley
   readership counts as impact indicators for conference papers, even

   An altmetrics study based on Mendeley Data}},

Abstract = {{Bibliometrics is successful in measuring impact because the target is
   clearly defined: the publishing scientist who is still active and
   working. Thus, citations are a target-oriented metric which measures
   impact on science. In contrast, societal impact measurements based on
   altmetrics are as a rule intended to measure impact in a broad sense on
   all areas of society (e.g. science, culture, politics, and economics).
   This tendency is especially reflected in the efforts to design composite
   indicators (e.g. the Altmetric Attention Score). We deem appropriate
   that not only the impact measurement using citations is target-oriented
   (citations measure the impact of papers on scientists) but also the
   measurement of impact using altmetrics. Impact measurements only make
   sense, if the target group-the recipient of academic papers-is clearly
   defined. Thus, we extend in this study the field-normalized reader
   impact indicator proposed by us in an earlier study, which is based on
   Mendeley data (the mean normalized reader score, MNRS), to a
   target-oriented field-normalized impact indicator (e.g. MNRSED measures
   reader impact on the sector of educational donation, i.e. teaching).
   This indicator can show-as demonstrated in empirical examples-the
   ability of journals, countries, and academic institutions to publish
   papers which are below or above the average impact of papers on a
   specific sector in society (e.g. the educational or teaching sector).
   Thus, the method allows to measure the impact of scientific papers on
   certain groups-controlling for the field in which the papers have been
   published and their publication year.}},

Abstract = {{This study identifies the presence, productivity and influence of
   Ibero-American authors that write about information literacy (InfoLit).
   Using bibliometric and altmetric indicators, it seeks to analyze the
   impact and subsequent use of their scholarly works on social and
   scientific platforms. Fifty-five authors with the highest productivity
   were identified, based on the results of bibliometric studies on InfoLit
   carried out on both an international and Ibero-American scale in
   searches of major databases as well as publications collected in a Latin
   American wiki. Subsequently an analysis of bibliometric and altmetric
   indicators at the author and publication level was carried out, based on
   the results of searches on eight scientific platforms (Google Scholar,
   ResearchGate, Academia. edu, Mendeley, ORCID, IraLIS, E-LIS and EXIT),
   three social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and data
   provided by a commercial supplier (Altmetric. com). Overall we found a
   greater presence of authors in ResearchGate (58\%), Academia. edu (51\%)
   and Google Scholar (49\%) as opposed to Mendeley (25\%) and ORCID
   (18\%). Furthermore, as to social platforms, the greatest potential
   influence lies with Facebook, due to its high number of followers (/top
   10 authors). In addition, an analysis with the Spearman rho statistic,
   shows among some sources and platforms, a low correlation between the
   number of citations in Google Scholar and readings in Mendeley (r = 382)
   and low negative for mentions in blogs (r = 0,-237), Google+ (r = 0,
   -214) and Twitter (r = 0, -183). In conclusion, both the productivity
   and the impact-visibility center on specific authors writing about
   InfoLit, and various measurement resources show that for these authors
   there is a positive two-way impact from bibliometric to altmetric and
   vice versa.}},

   higher usage counts or citations. Furthermore, the stability of
   CSS-class distributions substantiates the applicability of CSS in
   characterising both usage and citation distributions. Distinctly

Abstract = {{The academic social network site ResearchGate (RG) has its own
   indicator, RG Score, for its members. The high profile nature of the
   site means that the RG Score may be used for recruitment, promotion and
   other tasks for which researchers are evaluated. In response, this study
   investigates whether it is reasonable to employ the RG Score as evidence
   of scholarly reputation. For this, three different author samples were
   investigated. An outlier sample includes 104 authors with high values. A
   Nobel sample comprises 73 Nobel winners from Medicine and Physiology,
   Chemistry, Physics and Economics (from 1975 to 2015). A longitudinal
   sample includes weekly data on 4 authors with different RG Scores. The
   results suggest that high RG Scores are built primarily from activity
   related to asking and answering questions in the site. In particular, it
   seems impossible to get a high RG Score solely through publications.
   Within RG it is possible to distinguish between (passive) academics that
   interact little in the site and active platform users, who can get high
   RG Scores through engaging with others inside the site (questions,
   answers, social networks with influential researchers). Thus, RG Scores
   should not be mistaken for academic reputation indicators.}},

   on Twitter}},

Abstract = {{Twitter communication has permeated every sphere of society. To
   highlight and share small pieces of information with possibly vast
   audiences or small circles of the interested has some value in almost
   any aspect of social life. But what is the value exactly for a
   scientific field? We perform a comprehensive study of computer
   scientists using Twitter and their tweeting behavior concerning the
   sharing of web links. Discerning the domains, hosts and individual web
   pages being tweeted and the differences between computer scientists and
   a Twitter sample enables us to look in depth at the Twitter-based
   information sharing practices of a scientific community. Additionally,
   we aim at providing a deeper understanding of the role and impact of
   altmetrics in computer science and give a glance at the publications
   mentioned on Twitter that are most relevant for the computer science
   community. Our results show a link sharing culture that concentrates
   more heavily on public and professional quality information than the
   Twitter sample does. The results also show a broad variety in linked
   sources and especially in linked publications with some publications
   clearly related to community-specific interests of computer scientists,
   while others with a strong relation to attention mechanisms in social
   media. This refers to the observation that Twitter is a hybrid form of
   social media between an information service and a social network
   service. Overall the computer scientists' style of usage seems to be
   more on the information- oriented side and to some degree also on
   professional usage. Therefore, altmetrics are of considerable use in
   analyzing computer science.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of citations to academic articles are widely used as indicators
   of their scholarly impact. In addition, alternative indicators derived
   from social websites have been proposed to cover some of the
   shortcomings of citation counts. The most promising such indicator is
   counts of readers of an article in the social reference sharing site
   Mendeley. Although Mendeley reader counts tend to correlate strongly and
   positively with citation counts within scientific fields, an
   understanding of causes of citation-reader anomalies is needed before
   Mendeley reader counts can be used with confidence as indicators. In
   response, this article proposes a list reasons for anomalies based upon
   an analysis of articles that are highly cited but have few Mendeley
   readers, or vice versa. The results show that there are both technical
   and legitimate reasons for differences, with the latter including
   communities that use research but do not cite it in Scopus-indexed
   publications or do not use Mendeley. The results also suggest that the
   lower of the two values (citation counts, reader counts) tends to
   underestimate of the impact of an article and so taking the maximum is a
   reasonable strategy for a combined impact indicator.}},

Abstract = {{The prestige of publication has been based on traditional citation
   metrics, most commonly journal impact factor. However, the Internet has
   radically changed the speed, flow, and sharing of medical information.
   Furthermore, the explosion of social media, along with development of
   popular professional and scientific websites and blogs, has led to the
   need for alternative metrics, known as altmetrics, to quantify the wider
   impact of research. We explore the evolution of current research impact
   metrics and examine the evolving role of altmetrics in measuring the
   wider impact of research. We suggest that altmetrics used in research
   evaluation should be part of an informed peer-review process such as
   traditional metrics. Moreover, results based on altmetrics must not lead
   to direct decision making about research, but instead, should be used to
   assist experts in making decisions. Finally, traditional and alternative
   metrics should complement, not replace, each other in the peer-review
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether specific title
   characteristics could influence the likelihood of being included in the
   ``Altmetric Top 100.{''}
   Methods: We conducted a 1:2 matched case control study with the cases
   being the health care articles included in the ``Altmetric Top 100{''}
   lists (2013-2015) matched through a random computerized procedure with
   two health care articles published in the same journal and year. For
   each title, we extracted the number of characters in the title, the
   number of uncommon words, and whether the title was declarative.
   Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR)
   with 95\% confidence intervals adjusted for a prespecified baseline
   confounder (open access).
   Results: One hundred eight ``Medical and health sciences{''} articles
   were retrieved in the 2013-2015 ``Altmetric Top 100{''} and matched to
   216 control articles. Titles of the ``Altmetric Top 100{''} articles
   were 102.6 characters (+/- 42) long, included 3.4 (+/- 2.0) uncommon
   words, and 29.6\% (32/108) were ``declarative.{''} Titles of the matched
   articles were 109.3 characters (+/- 37.1) long, included 4.7 (+/- 2.4)
   uncommon words, and 21.8\% (47/216) were ``declarative.{''} After
   multivariate adjustment, declarative titles with a lower number of
   uncommon words were significantly more represented in the Altmetric
   list, with declarative titles having 2.8 times the odds of being in the
   top list (OR: 2.8; 95\% confidence interval: 1.2, 6.4). For each
   additional uncommon word in the title, there was a 1.4 increase in the
   odds of being a non-Altmetric Top 100 article (1.4; 1.2-1.6).
   Conclusion: An easy-to-understand, informative title may help bridge the
   gap between scholar and social media dissemination. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Local altmetrics is currently an integral part of the altmetrics
   landscape. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of
   microblog altmetrics of the Chinese microblog platform, Weibo, to shed
   light on cultural differences and draw attention to local altmetrics in
   developing countries. The analysis is based on 4.4 million records
   provided by Altmetric.com. Data collected are from March 2014 to July
   2015. It is found that Weibo users discuss global science, more actively
   compared with several international altmetrics sources. Statistical
   results show strong evidence of the immediacy advantage of metrics based
   on Weibo as well as Twitter and the general altmetrics over citations.
   Distribution of Weibo altmetrics on the article level, source level and
   discipline level are highly skewed. Overall, compared with Twitter,
   Weibo altmetrics present similar distributions, with some minor
   variations. To better understand how and why Weibo users discuss global
   scientific articles, the top weiboed articles, sources and disciplines
   are identified and further explored. Our content analysis shows that the
   common motivation of scientific weibos is to disseminate or discuss the
   articles because they are interesting, surprising, academically useful
   or practically useful. Conclusion of articles is the most frequently
   mentioned element in scientific weibos. In addition, different from
   Twitter, Weibo users have a preference for traditional prestigious
   journals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-growing number of venues publishing academic work makes it
   difficult for researchers to identify venues that publish data and
   research most in line with their scholarly interests. A solution is
   needed, therefore, whereby researchers can identify information
   dissemination pathways in order to both access and contribute to an
   existing body of knowledge. In this study, we present a system to
   recommend scholarly venues rated in terms of relevance to a given
   researcher's current scholarly pursuits and interests. We collected our
   data from an academic social network and modeled researchers' scholarly
   reading behavior in order to propose a new and adaptive implicit rating
   technique for venues. We present a way to recommend relevant,
   specialized scholarly venues using these implicit ratings that can
   provide quick results, even for new researchers without a publication
   history and for emerging scholarly venues that do not yet have an impact
   factor. We performed a large-scale experiment with real data to evaluate
   the current scholarly recommendation system and showed that our proposed
   system achieves better results than the baseline. The results provide
   important up-to-the-minute signals that compared with post-publication

Abstract = {{Introduction To report and analyse Altmetric data of all dental articles
   and journals in 2015. Methods To identify all 2015 dental articles,
   PubMed was searched via Altmetric platform using the following query:
   ({''}2015/1/1{''}{[}PDAT]: ``2015/12/31{''}{[}PDAT]) AND
   jsubsetd{[}text] NOT 2016{[}PDAT] on November 12, 2016. Altmetric data
   of all 2015 dental articles and journals were extracted and analysed by
   Microsoft Office Excel 2016 using descriptive statistics, graphs and
   trend-line analysis. To find the most important and influential
   Altmetric factors, multi-layered perceptron artificial neural network
   was employed using SPSS 22. Results A total of 14,884 dental articles
   published in 2015 using PubMed database were found, from which 5,153
   (34.62\%) articles had an Altmetric score. The mean Altmetric score was
   2.94 +/- 9.2 (95\% C.I: 2.703.22). Mendeley readers (73.19\%), Twitter
   (21.48\%), Facebook walls (3.67\%), news outlets (0.69\%) and bloggers
   (0.57\%) were the most popular Altmetric data resources. At journal
   level, 147 dental journals with valid Altmetric data were included in
   the study. The British Dental Journal had the first rank, followed by
   Journal of Dental Research, Journal of Clinical Periodontology and
   Journal of the American Dental Association. Sensitivity analysis showed
   news outlets, tweeters and scientific bloggers were the most important
   and influential Altmetric data resources. Discussion In comparison with
   all science subjects and medical and health sciences, 2015 Altmetric
   scores in dentistry were very low. Uses of new and emerging scholarly
   tools such as social media, scientific blogs and post-publication
   peer-review were not common in the dental science. This negligence may
   be due to lack of knowledge and attitude. An Altmetric score is dynamic
   and may fluctuate over time.}},

Title = {{A systematic identification and analysis of scientists on Twitter}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Metrics derived from Twitter and other social media-often referred to as
   altmetrics-are increasingly used to estimate the broader social impacts
   of scholarship. Such efforts, however, may produce highly misleading
   results, as the entities that participate in conversations about science
   on these platforms are largely unknown. For instance, if altmetric
   activities are generated mainly by scientists, does it really capture
   broader social impacts of science? Here we present a systematic approach
   to identifying and analyzing scientists on Twitter. Our method can
   identify scientists across many disciplines, without relying on external
   bibliographic data, and be easily adapted to identify other stakeholder
   groups in science. We investigate the demographics, sharing behaviors,
   and interconnectivity of the identified scientists. We find that Twitter
   has been employed by scholars across the disciplinary spectrum, with an
   over-representation of social and computer and information scientists;
   under-representation of mathematical, physical, and life scientists; and
   a better representation of women compared to scholarly publishing.
   Analysis of the sharing of URLs reveals a distinct imprint of scholarly
   sites, yet only a small fraction of shared URLs are science-related. We
   find an assortative mixing with respect to disciplines in the networks
   between scientists, suggesting the maintenance of disciplinary walls in
   social media. Our work contributes to the literature both
   methodologically and conceptually-we provide new methods for
   disambiguating and identifying particular actors on social media and
   describing the behaviors of scientists, thus providing foundational
   information for the construction and use of indicators on the basis of
   social media metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their important position in the research environment, there is a
   growing theoretical uncertainty concerning what research metrics
   indicate (e.g., quality, impact, attention). Here we utilize the same
   tools used to study latent traits like Intelligence and Personality to
   get a quantitative understanding of what over 20 common research metrics
   indicate about the papers they represent. The sample is all of the
   32,962 papers PLoS published in 2014, with results suggesting that there
   are at least two important underlying factors, which could generally be
   described as Scientific Attention/Discussion (citations), General
   Attention/Discussion (views, tweets), and potentially Media
   Attention/Discussion (media mentions). The General Attention metric is
   correlated about .50 with both the Academic and Media factors, though
   the Academic and Media attention are only correlated with each other
   below .05. The overall best indicator of the dataset was the total
   lifetime views on the paper, which is also probably the easiest to game.
   The results indicate the need for funding bodies to decide what they
   value and how to measure it (e.g., types of attention, quality).}},

   statistics and t test result show significant difference between number
   of posts (NP) and number of unique users (NUU). For several altmetrics
   indicators, NP has moderate to low correlation with NUU. User category
   is found to have huge impact on altmetrics count. Analysis of twitter
   user category shows the general tweet distribution is strongly
   influenced by the public user. Tweets from research user are more
   correlated with citations than any other user categories. Moreover,
   disciplinary difference exists for different user categories.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{349-369}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{To explore whether there are other factors than count and sentiment that
   should be incorporated in evaluating research papers with social media
   mentions, this paper analyses the content of tweets linking to the top
   100 papers of 2015 taken from www.altmetric.com, focusing on the goals,
   functions and features of research. We discuss three basic issues
   inherent in using tweets for research evaluation: whose tweets can be
   used to assess a paper, what objects can be evaluated, and how to score
   the paper according to each tweet. We suggest that tweets written by
   those involved in publication of the paper in question should not be
   included in the paper's evaluation. Tweets unrelated to the content of
   the paper should also be excluded. Because controversies in research are
   inevitable and difficult to resolve, we suggest omitting somewhat
   supportive and negative tweets in research evaluation. Logically,
   neutral tweets (such as those linking to, and excerpts from, papers)
   express a degree of compliment, agreement, interest, or surprise, albeit
   less so than the tweets explicitly expressing these sentiments.
   Recommendation tweets also reflect one or more of these sentiments.
   Expansion tweets, which are inspired by the papers, reflect the function
   of research. Therefore, we suggest giving a higher weight to praise,
   agreement, interest, surprise, recommendation and expansion tweets
   linking to an academic paper than neutral tweets when scoring a paper.
   Issues related to electronic publishing and social media as learned from
   tweets are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Social laboratories, defined as experimental spaces for co-creation,
   have recently become the main centers of innovation. Medialabs are
   experimental laboratories of technologies and communication media which
   have co-evolved along with the digital society into mediation
   laboratories of citizen experimentation, observing a confluence of both
   models. in recent years, these centers have expanded within the higher
   education context, generating new forms of innovation and posing the
   question of how to measure the impact of such open spaces. This paper
   analyzes the origin and development of social laboratories in Spain. it
   first reviews their historical development from their antecedents in the
   19th Century to the most recent initiatives. it focuses specifically on
   initiatives launched within the university context, highlighting their
   role as motors of innovation. Then, it presents the case of Medialab
   UgR, a co-creation and digital culture center of social collaboration
   framed in the digital context. Finally, it offers a first approach
   towards the assessment of its social impact by using Twitter and
   analyzes its capacity to mobilize and reach non-academic audiences. The
   findings show the plurality of actors involved in this type of networks
   as well as the difficulty and complexity of the task for the development

Abstract = {{In recent years, the relationship of collaboration among scientists and
   the citation impact of papers have been frequently investigated. Most of
   the studies show that the two variables are closely related: An
   increasing collaboration activity (measured in terms of number of
   authors, number of affiliations, and number of countries) is associated
   with an increased citation impact. However, it is not clear whether the
   increased citation impact is based on the higher quality of papers that
   profit from more than one scientist giving expert input or other
   (citation-specific) factors. Thus, the current study addresses this
   question by using two comprehensive data sets with publications (in the
   biomedical area) including quality assessments by experts (F1000Prime
   member scores) and citation data for the publications. The study is
   based on more than 15,000 papers. Robust regression models are used to
   investigate the relationship between number of authors, number of
   affiliations, and number of countries, respectively, and citation
   impact-controlling for the papers' quality (measured by F1000Prime
   expert ratings). The results point out that the effect of collaboration
   activities on impact is largely independent of the papers' quality. The
   citation advantage is apparently not quality related; citation-specific
   factors (e.g., self-citations) seem to be important here.}},

   assessment procedures}},
Journal = {{PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Research assessment in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) is
   delicate. Assessment procedures meet strong criticisms from SSH scholars
   and bibliometric research shows that the methods that are usually
   applied are ill-adapted to SSH research. While until recently research
   on assessment in the SSH disciplines focused on the deficiencies of the
   current assessment methods, we present some European initiatives that
   take a bottom-up approach. They focus on research practices in SSH and
   reflect on how to assess SSH research with its own approaches instead of
   applying and adjusting the methods developed for and in the natural and
   life sciences. This is an important development because we can learn
   from previous evaluation exercises that whenever scholars felt that
   assessment procedures were imposed in a top-down manner without proper
   adjustments to SSH research, it resulted in boycotts or resistance.
   Applying adequate evaluation methods not only helps foster a better
   valorization of SSH research within the research community, among
   policymakers and colleagues from the natural sciences, but it will also
   help society to better understand SSH's contributions to solving major
   societal challenges. Therefore, taking the time to encourage bottom-up
   evaluation initiatives should result in being able to better confront
   the main challenges facing modern society. This article is published as
   part of a collection on the future of research assessment.}},

Title = {{Measuring scientific impact beyond academia: An assessment of existing
   impact metrics and proposed improvements}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{How does scientific research affect the world around us? Being able to
   answer this question is of great importance in order to appropriately
   channel efforts and resources in science. The impact by scientists in
   academia is currently measured by citation based metrics such as
   h-index, i-index and citation counts. These academic metrics aim to
   represent the dissemination of knowledge among scientists rather than
   the impact of the research on the wider world. In this work we are
   interested in measuring scientific impact beyond academia, on the
   economy, society, health and legislation (comprehensive impact). Indeed
   scientists are asked to demonstrate evidence of such comprehensive
   impact by authoring case studies in the context of the Research
   Excellence Framework (REF). We first investigate the extent to which
   existing citation based metrics can be indicative of comprehensive
   impact. We have collected all recent REF impact case studies from 2014
   and we have linked these to papers in citation networks that we
   constructed and derived from CiteSeerX, arXiv and PubMed Central using a
   number of text processing and information retrieval techniques. We have
   demonstrated that existing citation-based metrics for impact measurement
   do not correlate well with REF impact results. We also consider metrics
   of online attention surrounding scientific works, such as those provided
   by the Altmetric API. We argue that in order to be able to evaluate
   wider non-academic impact we need to mine information from a much wider
   set of resources, including social media posts, press releases, news
   articles and political debates stemming from academic work. We also
   provide our data as a free and reusable collection for further analysis,
   including the PubMed citation network and the correspondence between REF
   case studies, grant applications and the academic literature.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. The concept of attention is applied in two altmetric
   studies concerning: (1) the use of social media tools on the web pages
   of scientific journals, and indications of attention in these pages
   received, and (2) attention received by the radio news on the web page
   of an indigenous radio station. The purpose is to reveal characteristics
   of web publications connected to the attention they receive.
   Method. Altmetric data describing attention data was compiled from the
   Facebook sites of scientific journals and the Facebook pages of an
   indigenous radio station news programme, as well as the news programme's
   web site. The study was both quantitative and qualitative.
   Analysis. Attention was operationalized in the form of comments, likes
   or sharing of Facebook postings and these were analyzed quantitatively.
   The contents of the postings were analysed by qualitative content
   analysis.
   Results. The characteristics of the postings receiving most attention
   were relevance, community (in the sense of ownership), belonging and
   co-creation, and engagement in the meaning of interactivity.
   Conclusions. In altmetric research, data originating from several
   sources can reflect the societal impact a project or a publication may
   have, not only the impact it has in science. Attention economy theory
   supports the interpretation of altmetric data.}},

Abstract = {{Digital object identifiers (DOIs) were launched in 1997 to facilitate
   the longterm access and identification of objects in digital
   environments. The objective of the present investigation is to assess
   the DOI availability of articles in biomedical journals indexed in the
   PubMed database and to complete this investigation with a geographical
   analysis of journals by the country of publisher. Articles were randomly
   selected from PubMed using their PubMed identifier and were downloaded
   from and processed through developed Hypertext Preprocessor language
   scripts. The first part of the analysis focuses on the period 1966-2015
   (50 years). Of the 496,665 articles studied over this period, 201,055
   have DOIs (40.48\%). Results showed that the percentage of articles with
   DOIs began to increase for articles published in the 2000s, with
   spectacular growth in the years 2002-2003, then reached a peak in 2015.
   Data on countries showed that some countries gradually implemented DOIs
   over the period 1966 to 2015 (the United States, the United Kingdom, and
   the Netherlands), while some did not (Russia, the Czech Republic, and
   Romania). The second part of the analysis focuses on the year 2015 and
   includes 268,790 articles published in 2015, randomly selected to
   evaluate the current implementation of DOIs. In 2015, 86.42\% of
   articles had DOIs. The geographical analysis of countries of publishers
   showed that some countries (Russia, Thailand, and Ukraine) still
   assigned few DOIs to articles in 2015. Thus, if the scientific community
   aims to increase the number and the usefulness of services rendered by
   DOIs, efforts must be made to generalize their use by all persons
   involved in scientific publication, particularly publishers.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to investigate and compare the social media
   (SM) impact of 273 South Africa Post-Secondary Education accredited
   journals, which are recognised by the Department of Higher Education and
   Training of South Africa for purposes of financial support. We used
   multiple sources to extract data for the study, namely, Altmetric. com,
   Google Scholar (GS), Scopus (through SCImago) and the Thomson Reuters
   (TR) Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Data was analysed to determine
   South African journals' presence in and impact on SM as well as to
   contrast SM visibility and impact with the citation impact in GS, JCR
   and Scopus. The Spearman correlation test was performed to compare the
   impact of the journals on SM and other sources. The results reveal that
   2923 articles published in 122 of the 273 South African (SA) journals
   have received at least one mention in SM; the most commonly used SM
   platforms were Twitter and Facebook; the journals indexed in the TR's
   citation indexes and Scopus performed much better, in terms of their
   average altmetrics, than non-TR and non-Scopus indexed journals; and
   there were weak to moderate relationships among different types of
   altmetrics and citation-based measures, thereby implying different kinds
   of journal impacts on SM when compared to the scholarly impact reflected
   in citation databases. In conclusion, South African journals' impact on
   SM, just as is the case with countries with similar economies, is
   minimal but has shown signs of growth.}},

Abstract = {{In this short communication, we provide an overview of a relatively

   for societal impact measurements in scientometrics. Recently,
   Altmetric-a start-up providing publication level metrics-started to make
   data for publications available which have been mentioned in
   policy-related documents. Using data from Altmetric, we study how many
   papers indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) are mentioned in
   policy-related documents. We find that less than 0.5\% of the papers
   published in different subject categories are mentioned at least once in
   policy-related documents. Based on our results, we recommend that the
   analysis of (WoS) publications with at least one policy-related mention
   is repeated regularly (annually) in order to check the usefulness of the
   data. Mentions in policy-related documents should not be used for impact
   measurement until new policy-related sites are tracked.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a multivariate model for the evaluation of
   international emergency medicine journals using the most widely used,
   efficient and representative productivity and citation indicators. This
   is a descriptive observational evaluation study based on a sample of 24
   journals included in the emergency medicine category of the Journal
   Citation Reports 2015. The sample is evaluated based on seven evaluation
   indicators: Journal Citation Reports impact factor, three H-indices (Web
   of Science, Scimago and Google Scholar), the Scimago Journal Rank and
   two altmetric scores (3-month and any time). The bivariate correlations
   between the diverse distributions of evaluation indicators and a
   multivariate metric reliability index are calculated. The factorial
   structure of the indicators is explored and clusters of journals are
   defined. A factor score is assigned to each journal. The correlations
   between the seven evaluation indicators are high and statistically
   significant. The metric reliability of the multivariate analysis
   calculated using Cronbach's alpha is .97. A general factor explains the
   84.64\% variance of the factor space of the seven evaluation indicators,
   representing the `quality of EM journals' construct. The most
   well-represented indicator, the one with the highest communality, is
   H\_Index\_WoS (h = .922), which is also the indicator with the greatest
   weight in the general factor (a = .96). The journals can be classified
   in four clusters according to their quality. A factor score is generated
   for each journal that could be used as a multivariate meta-index to
   evaluate journal quality and to define a ranking of journals.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{128-151}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although altmetrics and other web-based alternative indicators are now
   commonplace in publishers' websites, they can be difficult for research
   evaluators to use because of the time or expense of the data, the need
   to benchmark in order to assess their values, the high proportion of
   zeros in some alternative indicators, and the time taken to calculate
   multiple complex indicators. These problems are addressed here by (a) a
   field normalisation formula, the Mean Normalised Log-transformed
   Citation Score (MNLCS) that allows simple confidence limits to be
   calculated and is similar to a proposal of Lundberg, (b) field
   normalisation formulae for the proportion of cited articles in a set,
   the Equalised Mean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (EMNPC) and the
   Mean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (MNPC), to deal with mostly
   uncited data sets, (c) a sampling strategy to minimise data collection
   costs, and (d) free unified software to gather the raw data, implement
   the sampling strategy, and calculate the indicator formulae and
   confidence limits. The approach is demonstrated (but not fully tested)
   by comparing the Scopus citations, Mendeley readers and Wikipedia
   mentions of research funded by Wellcome, NIH, and MRC in three large
   fields for 2013-2016. Within the results, statistically significant
   differences in both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts were
   found even for sets of articles that were less than six months old.
   Mendeley reader counts were more precise than Scopus citations for the
   most recent articles and all three funders could be demonstrated to have
   an impact in Wikipedia that was significantly above the world average.

Abstract = {{When the meaning of key terms is incompatible in competing taxonomies, a

   at present: Impact is no longer defined as impact on science alone

   culture, or politics). In this Short Communication, we outline that the
   current revolution in scientometrics does not only imply a broadening of
   the impact perspective, but also the devaluation of quality
   considerations in evaluative contexts. Impact might no longer be seen as
   a proxy for quality, but in its original sense: the simple resonance in

Abstract = {{With the emergence of Web 2.0, an online platform which encourages
   online creation of next generation tools, communication has become a
   nigh-indispensable tool for researchers. Allowing them to acquire,
   spread, and share research achievements, with a free flow of ideas
   online. At present, there are a growing number of studies on
   non-traditional evaluation indicators, but there is much fewer research
   focused on the software evaluation, especially for open source research
   software. What this research focuses on is; with the use of the open
   source project `Depsy', this research evaluated and analyzed data
   collected from downloads made online through these open source software.
   Altmetrics cannot be confined to traditional measurable indicators. That
   the importance of the open source software used, and its position in the
   online community is itself a strong measure for academic impact and
   success, which is all too often overlooked in research. The research can
   also conclude that the multiplexing of software online, through the
   citation of a citation, ultimately leads to an online peered review
   system within the community, effectively developing and maintaining
   through open use software itself. Moreover, the benefits of such a
   system has only just begun to come to fruition, having a strong impact
   on academic research, and predicting research impact.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the evolution in
   notions from bibliometrics to altmetrics and confront them taking into
   consideration specific criteria. The objective of this paper is to
   present the evolution of research, regarding the above fields, the study
   of metrics and indicators used, and the strength and weaknesses
   resulting from the current literature. Furthermore, the authors present
   the manipulation techniques for both fields as their main weakness, as
   well as further key points, analyzing the alternative options of
   bibliometrics and altmetrics.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the authors present the evolution
   of the literature, concerning the specific field and metrics used,
   following with a brief description of basic indicators related to the
   field of bibliometrics (journal impact factor (JIF), eigenfactor,
   article influence score and h-index) discussing their advantages and
   disadvantages. In the second part, the authors describe altmetrics and
   present the differences with bibliometrics.
   Findings - Both bibliometrics and altmetrics remain weak indicators as
   fraught with disadvantages with manipulation being the greatest of all.
   Nevertheless, the combination of the two is proposed in order to export
   safer conclusions on assessing the impact. Regarding the manipulation
   there is yet not a clean technique to eliminate manipulation. In
   specific, regarding bibliometrics, the manipulation of indicators refers
   only to the human factor intervention. The theoretical implication of
   this study constitutes of collecting the relevant literature regarding
   scientific indicators.
   Research limitations/implications -We must consider the study of new
   indicators, which combine metrics and methodologies used in both
   bibliometrics and altmetrics. The theoretical implication of this study
   constitutes of collecting the relevant literature regarding scientific
   indicators. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed
   propositions further.
   Practical implications - The practical contribution, on the other side,
   provides scholars with the knowledge of how making their work more
   accessible, increasing their impact.
   Originality/value - The authors add to the originality by providing a
   framework of the relevant literature for bibliometrics and altmetrics
   for future researchers. The authors describe altmetrics and present the
   differences with bibliometrics. The authors conclude the research with
   the implications of the conducted analysis and the potential directions
   for future research. Regarding manipulation, the authors provide with
   the techniques so researchers are aware of the methods in order to
   protect their academic profile.}},

   the Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries
   (EJISDC) in the 14-year period 2000 to 2013 were examined. Results
   showed that all 378 articles were downloaded and had Mendeley readers.
   Of the 378 articles, 359 (94.97\%) articles received Google Scholar
   citations and 19 (5.03\%) articles received no citations. For the 359
   cited articles, the average Google Scholar citations per article were
   28.82. The average EJISDC downloads were 7440.69, the average Mendeley
   readership was 19.30 and Google Scholar citations were 27.36. The most
   influential articles in the EJISDC were identified by ranking and by
   comparing the top 20 articles by downloads, Mendeley readership and
   Google Scholar citations. The leading authors were identified using the
   top 20 ranking and comparing it to the most productive authors. For this
   journal, the results seem to indicate that the highest correlations
   (Spearman correlation coefficient) were between Google Scholar citations
   and downloads, a slightly lower correlation between Google Scholar
   citations and Mendeley readership, and the lowest correlation was
   between downloads and Mendeley readership.}},

   2014-April 2017) investigating the e-visibility themes of online
   presence, researcher discoverability and accessibility of research
   output of the environmental science researchers at the University of
   South Africa. Bibliometric and altmetric data were collected via online
   searches and an online survey was completed by the School of
   Environmental Sciences during December 2014. The results for online
   research presence indicate a preference for using free search engines
   versus fee-based traditional resources. Regarding researcher
   discoverability via e-profiles, the results indicated a preference for
   using free websites, with the highest distribution on LinkedIn. A higher
   distribution of research output on free online resources was reported,
   with a low percentage of researchers participated in self-archiving on
   social networking tools, in online archives and in repositories, which
   resulted in a small percentage of accessible research output online.

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare four popular academic
   social networking sites (ASNSs), namely, ResearchGate, Academia.edu,
   Mendeley and Zotero.
   Design/methodology/approach - Evaluation method has been used with the
   help of checklist covering various features of ASNSs. A structured
   checklist has been prepared to compare four popular ASNSs, comprising
   198 dichotomous questions divided into 12 broad categories.
   Findings - The study found that performance of ASNSs using the latest
   features and services is not up to the mark, and none of the site is
   rated as ``Excellent{''}. The sites lack in incorporation of session
   filters; output features; privacy settings and text display; and search
   and browsing fields. Availability of bibilographic features and general
   features is poor in these sites. Further, altmetrics and analytics
   features are not incorporated properly. User interface of the sites need
   to improve to draw researchers to use them. The study report reveals
   that ResearchGate scored the highest, 61.1 per cent points, and was
   ranked ``above average{''}, followed by Academia. edu with 48.0 per cent
   and Mendeley with 43.9 per cent are ranked ``average{''}. However, the
   Zotero (38.9 per cent) was ranked ``below average{''}.
   Practical implications - Accreditation agencies can identify suitable
   sites in the evaluation of institutions' research output. Further,
   students and faculty members can choose the site suiting their needs.
   Library and information science professionals can use the checklist to
   impart training to the academic community which can help fostering
   research and development activities.
   Originality/value - The study identifies features that ought to be
   available in a model ASNS. These features are categorized into 12 broad
   categories. The findings can also be used by developers of the sites to
   enhance functionalities. Institutions can choose suitable sites while
   collaborating with other institutions.}},

Title = {{On the quest for currencies of science Field ``exchange rates{''} for
   citations and Mendeley readership}},
Journal = {{ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{557-575}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The introduction of ``altmetrics{''} as new tools to analyze
   scientific impact within the reward system of science has challenged the
   hegemony of citations as the predominant source for measuring scientific
   impact. Mendeley readership has been identified as one of the most
   important altmetric sources, with several features that are similar to
   citations. The purpose of this paper is to perform an in-depth analysis
   of the differences and similarities between the distributions of
   Mendeley readership and citations across fields.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyze two issues by using in
   each case a common analytical framework for both metrics: the shape of
   the distributions of readership and citations, and the field
   normalization problem generated by differences in citation and
   readership practices across fields. In the first issue the authors use
   the characteristic scores and scales method, and in the second the
   measurement framework introduced in Crespo et al. (2013).
   Findings - There are three main results. First, the citations and
   Mendeley readership distributions exhibit a strikingly similar degree of
   skewness in all fields. Second, the results on ``exchange rates
   (ERs){''} for Mendeley readership empirically supports the possibility
   of comparing readership counts across fields, as well as the field
   normalization of readership distributions using ERs as normalization
   factors. Third, field normalization using field mean readerships as
   normalization factors leads to comparably good results.
   Originality/value - These findings open up challenging new questions,
   particularly regarding the possibility of obtaining conflicting results
   from field normalized citation and Mendeley readership indicators; this
   suggests the need for better determining the role of the two metrics in
   capturing scientific recognition.}},

Journal = {{ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship
   between dissemination of research papers on Twitter and its influence on
   research impact.
   Design/methodology/approach - Four types of journal Twitter accounts
   (journal, owner, publisher and no Twitter account) were defined to
   observe differences in the number of tweets and citations. In total,
   4,176 articles from 350 journals were extracted from Plum Analytics.
   This altmetric provider tracks the number of tweets and citations for
   each paper. Student's t-test for two-paired samples was used to detect
   significant differences between each group of journals. Regression
   analysis was performed to detect which variables may influence the
   getting of tweets and citations.
   Findings - The results show that journals with their own Twitter account
   obtain more tweets (46 percent) and citations (34 percent) than journals
   without a Twitter account. Followers is the variable that attracts more
   tweets (beta = 0.47) and citations (beta = 0.28) but the effect is small
   and the fit is not good for tweets (R-2 = 0.46) and insignificant for
   citations (R-2 = 0.18).
   Originality/value - This is the first study that tests the performance
   of research journals on Twitter according to their handles, observing
   how the dissemination of content in this microblogging network
   influences the citation of their papers.}},

Title = {{Measuring global research activities using geographic data of scholarly
   article visits}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONIC LIBRARY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{822-838}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to analyse the geographical distribution of
   global research activities and to investigate the knowledge diffusion
   embodied in scientific papers.
   Design/methodology/approach -The geographical summary of Frontiers
   articles displays the number of visits and categorizes where the
   visitors hail from. This study uses the records of 23,798 articles
   published in 16 Frontiers journals from 2007 to 2015 to analyse the
   geographical distribution of article visits at both country and city
   levels. The process of knowledge diffusion is investigated on the basis
   of the different visiting patterns of new and old papers.
   Findings - Most article visits are concentrated around major
   metropolitan areas and some high-tech clusters. The top ``visiting
   countries{''} include both developed countries and developing countries,
   and the USA and China are two major players. Publishing cities dominate
   article visits for new papers; as time passes, there is diffusion from
   the publishing cities to a broader area.
   Research limitations/implications - The data on visiting for open access
   articles may be generated from various repositories besides the
   publishers' websites; these data are ignored, as they are not
   significant enough to have much influence. There is also a lack of a
   basic theory in the data processing of outliers in the data set. In
   addition, only static results are given in this paper, as the data were
   collected on one day, for one time. A longer time period is necessary to
   track the dynamic diffusion process of the observations.
   Practical implications - Introduction of usage data will propose a novel
   way to analyse research activities and track knowledge diffusion. Social
   implications - The visiting data of articles offer a new way to
   investigate research activities at the city level in a detailed and
   timely manner, for the geographical distribution of research activities
   and the research resource allocation of a specific country to be
   explored.
   Originality/value - This study measured the research activities of
   scientific papers by examining the usage data. Compared with previous
   studies that focused on the geographical distribution of scientific
   activities using publication data, citation data and even altmetrics
   data, usage data are at the forefront of this research. Therefore, usage
   data offer a fresh perspective on methodology, providing more detailed
   and real-time information.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL LIBRARY PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{294-304}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Whereas traditional book and journal publishing remain the
   gold standard for many post-secondary institutions, nontraditional
   publishing is just as prolific at the flagship university in Maine. The
   university has strong land and sea grant missions that drive a broad
   research agenda, with an emphasis on community outreach and engagement.
   However, the impact of researchers' contributions outside of academe is
   unlikely to be accurately reflected in promotion, tenure or review
   processes. Thus, the authors designed a series of altmetrics workshops
   aimed at seeding conversations around novel ways to track the impact of
   researchers' diverse scholarly and creative outputs.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a case study of the
   instructional approach taken at the University of Maine library to
   facilitate discussions of alternative impact assessments that reach
   beyond traditional publications.
   Findings - Evaluations revealed an increased awareness of, and interest
   in, impact tracking tools that capture both traditional scholarship,
   like journal articles, and nontraditional scholarly and creative
   outputs, such as videos, podcasts and newsletters. The authors learned
   that altmetrics provides an entry point into a broader conversation
   about scholarly impact, and was best received by those whose scholarly
   output is not always captured by traditional metrics.
   Practical implications - Scholars are equipped with novel methods for
   describing the value of their work and discovering a broader audience
   for their research. Future initiatives will target the needs identified
   through initial conversations around altmetrics.
   Originality/value - Altmetrics workshops provide spaces to explore the
   potential for new tools that capture a range of previously unconsidered
   measures of impact, and to discuss the implications of those measures.}},

Journal = {{DIGITAL LIBRARY PERSPECTIVES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{305-313}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The Saint Mary's College of California (SMC) library plays an
   integral role in supporting one of the goals in the College's Strategic
   Plan: ``Raise the Academic Profile and Distinction{''}. This case study
   aims to assess the effectiveness of PlumX as a tool to showcase the
   academic profile and distinction of SMC. The library recognizes the
   importance of capturing impact of non-traditional creativity and
   engagement in addition to just traditional impact metrics of research.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes the collaborative
   effort of the College and the College's library to identify faculty
   scholarship, creativity and engagement and collect data demonstrating
   the impact of the works. Traditional metrics, like citation counts, do
   not do SMC faculty justice because faculty scholarship comes beyond just
   books and articles. To more fully document the real intellectual corpus
   the College, the library is working with a new system, PlumX, to collect
   web-based information about both traditionally and non-traditionally
   published work.
   Findings - The collection of metrics across five categories (citations,
   usage, social media, mentions and captures), and the flexibility of
   displaying on screen or downloading for use in other analytic reports
   made possible through PlumX proved to be a start toward demonstrating
   the academic distinction of College's unique faculty. SMC will continue
   to partner with PlumX to assess and improve its usability and
   effectiveness.
   Originality/value - This paper outlines how altmetrics can be used to
   measure and share impact of faculty research at a liberal arts,
   teaching-focused college in ways reflective of the unique intellectual
   contributions.}},

   Cincinnati, College of Medicine (COM).
   Design/methodology/approach - A three-year analysis of peer-reviewed
   papers and invited editorials from 2009 to 2013 written by tenure-track
   faculty from 20 COM departments was done to explore what subject areas
   received the highest altmetric scores. Research output was searched in
   PubMed; articles were quantified by subject area, times cited in Scopus,
   and its altmetric score over each of three successive years.
   Findings - The topics of the highest scored altmetric papers (n = 40)
   sample focused on stroke, obesity, and diabetes for all three years.
   Analysis of high initial altmetric scores over the course of the three
   years shifted from a possible predictor of future impact in the second
   year to no indicator of long-term interest in the scientific community
   as the public interest waned over time.
   Research limitations/implications -
   TheauthorsusedScopusTimesCitedandAltmetrics.comtogatherdata.
   Originality/value - Initially assessed a total of 3,678 unique
   publications and worked with the 40 highest altmetric scores in
   subsequent years. Data showed that subjects of interest to the public
   receive the highest altmetric scores and the topic areas did not change
   over the course of the study. These initially high altmetric scores do
   not indicate long-term interest by the scientific community.}},

Pages = {{337-353}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive
   understanding of scholarly discussions of academic publications on the
   social web and to further discuss the validity of altmetrics as a
   research impact assessment tool for academic articles.
   Design/methodology/approach - Facebook posts citing psychological
   journal papers were collected for both quantitative and qualitative
   analyses. A content analysis approach was adopted to investigate topic
   preferences and motivations for scholarly discussions among academic and
   non-academic Facebook users.
   Findings - Non-academic users were more actively engaged in scholarly
   discussions on Facebook than academic users. Among 1,711 Facebook users
   in the sample, 71.4 percent of them belonged to non-academic users,
   while 28.6 percent were from an academic background. The Facebook users
   cited psychological articles with various motivations: discussion and
   evaluation toward articles (20.4 percent), application to real life
   practices (16.5 percent), self-promotion (6.4 percent), and data source
   exchange (6.0 percent). However, nearly half of the posts (50.1 percent)
   were simply sharing articles without additional user comments. These
   results implicate that Facebook metric (a count of mentions of a
   research article on Facebook), as an important source of altmetrics,
   better reflects the attitudes or perceptions of the general public
   instead of academia.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by
   enriching the understanding of Facebook metric as an academic and
   non-academic impact assessment tool for scientific publication. Through
   the content analysis of Facebook posts, it also draws insights into the
   ways in which non-academic audiences are engaging with scholarly
   outputs.}},

Pages = {{174-183}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Mendeley reader counts have been proposed as early indicators
   for the impact of academic publications. The purpose of this paper is to
   assess whether there are enough Mendeley readers for research evaluation
   purposes during the month when an article is first published.
   Design/methodology/approach - Average Mendeley reader counts were
   compared to the average Scopus citation counts for 104,520 articles from
   ten disciplines during the second half of 2016.
   Findings - Articles attracted, on average, between 0.1 and 0.8 Mendeley
   readers per article in the month in which they first appeared in Scopus.
   This is about ten times more than the average Scopus citation count.
   Research limitations/implications - Other disciplines may use Mendeley
   more or less than the ten investigated here. The results are dependent
   on Scopus's indexing practices, and Mendeley reader counts can be
   manipulated and have national and seniority biases.
   Practical implications - Mendeley reader counts during the month of
   publication are more powerful than Scopus citations for comparing the
   average impacts of groups of documents but are not high enough to
   differentiate between the impacts of typical individual articles.
   Originality/value - This is the first multi-disciplinary and systematic
   analysis of Mendeley reader counts from the publication month of an
   article.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the research
   performance of Pakistani library and information science (LIS) scholars,
   using the altmetrics provided by ResearchGate (RG).
   Design/methodology/approach - Purposive sampling was used to collect
   profiles between 15 January 2015 and 30 April 2016 of all members of RG
   who had self-identified as being an LIS scholar of Pakistani
   nationality. Additional demographic data were obtained through a small
   survey administered via Google Docs. Resultant data were analysed in
   SPSS Version 21.
   Findings - Study results were broadly consistent in terms of
   demographical data with previous studies of this cohort. There was a
   positive correlation between publications, reads, and citations for
   scholars who had recorded at least one publication. The majority of
   publications had not been published in a high impact factor journal.
   Academic networking site profiles create the potential for
   collaboration, building connections, and exchanging information.
   Research limitations/implications - Some scholars eliminated from this
   study may have published at least one output but neglected to upload
   details to RG. It is a purposive, exploratory study that provides
   insights into future research.
   Practical implications - The paper produces findings of relevance to
   researchers in other countries and/or disciplines who may wish to
   conduct a similar study of a defined cohort.

Title = {{A comparative study of the impact of Korean research articles in four
   academic fields using altmetrics}},
Journal = {{PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND METRICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{38-51}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Alternative metrics (altmetrics) are non-traditional metrics
   to measure the social impact of research results, which were unable to
   be assessed by the previous methods, by calculating how research results
   are reflected in various social media. The purpose of this paper is to
   measure and compare the impact of Korean study results in four fields
   that were published in international journals using altmetrics.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study analysed the impact of 383
   Korean research articles published by international journals in the
   field of medical science, engineering, social science and arts and
   humanities through altmetrics and compared it with bibliometrics.
   Findings - As a result, the frequency of research articles which are
   ``discussed{''}through social media such as Twitter was shown to be
   highest in the medical science than in other fields. In addition, the
   frequency of research articles which were ``saved{''}through reference
   management tool such as Mendeley was shown to be higher in the social
   science and the arts and humanities than in other fields. Furthermore,
   as a result of a correlation analysis between altmetrics and
   bibliometrics, it is found that there exists a positive correlation
   between the number of articles which were ``saved{''} in Mendeley and
   ``cited{''} in follow-up studies.
   Originality/value - This study examined the impact of the articles
   originating in non-English-speaking nations; it could be referred by
   other non-English-speaking nations that are trying to identify invisible
   impact of their research output on global society. By finding the
   academic field which are receiving special attention from global
   community using altmetrics, researchers could prospect country's overall
   research impact and utilize it to make a future R\&D plan.}},

Title = {{An altmetric analysis of ResearchGate profiles of physics researchers A
   study of University of Delhi (India)}},
Journal = {{PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND METRICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{52-66}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to carry out an altmetric
   analysis of faculty members and research scholars of Department of
   Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi (India) (Univ.Delhi P\&A)
   who are members of the academic social networking site ResearchGate.
   ReserachGate is a rich source of altmetric indictors such as
   publications, reads, profile views, citations, impact points, RGScore,
   followers and following, etc. The RGScore, unique to ResearchGate, was
   further explored in depth in the study.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected manually by
   visiting the profile pages of all the members who had an account in
   ResearchGate under Univ. Delhi P\&A during the first week of July, 2016.
   The authors found a total of 173 members in ResearchGate from the
   department. Data were collected for publications, reads, profile views,
   citations, impact points, RGScore, followers and following from the
   profile pages of the members. Correlations were calculated amongst the
   metrics provided by ResearchGate to seek the nature of the relationship
   amongst the various ResearchGate metrics.
   Findings - The analysis revealed that the publications added by
   researchers to their profiles were relatively low, as 28.32 per cent of
   the members had not added even a single publication to their profiles.
   Average reads acquired per person was found to be 909.49 and the median
   value of reads was found to be 95. Average citation per member in
   ResearchGate was found to be 414.60 and the median value was found to be
   7. Majority of the researchers (45.09 per cent) had impact points in the
   range of 0.2-50. Most of the members (35.84 per cent) had followers in
   the range of 1-10. Majority of the members (52.02 per cent) had profile
   views in the range of 1-100. Most of the members (26.01 per cent) had
   RGScore equivalent to 0.01. The highest correlation of RGScore was found
   with publications added by researchers to their profiles, followed by
   correlation between RGScore and reads, correlation between RGscore and
   profile views, correlation between RGScore and number of Full Texts and
   correlation between RGScore and number of followers of a researcher.
   Originality/value - Not much research has been conducted in the area of
   altmetrics, especially using ResearchGate as a source of altmetrics. The
   findings of the study help in understanding the validity of ResearchGate
   as a source of altmetrics for research evaluation in a developing
   country such as India. Also, the novel ResearchGate indicator RGScore
   has been evaluated in great depth and its relationship with other
   ResearchGate altmetric and bibliometric indicators has been established.}},

Title = {{Twenty years of readership of library and information science literature
   under Mendeley's microscope}},
Journal = {{PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND METRICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{67-77}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Altmetric indicators have been proposed as a complement to
   citation counts in research evaluation. Conceivably, they might also be
   used to supplement other methods for estimating journal readership. The
   purpose of this paper is to explore the use of Mendeley reference
   management software to characterize the features of the readership of
   library and information science (LIS) literature.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used the Social Sciences
   Citation Index to retrieve 54,655 articles and reviews published between
   1995 and 2014 and indexed in the category ``Information Science \&
   Library Science{''}. Each record was then searched in Mendeley to obtain
   the number of bookmarks of the paper and the academic status of the
   users.
   Findings - Mendeley covers 61 per cent of the LIS literature published
   in the last 20 years. In all, 75 per cent of the papers published in the
   last five years had been bookmarked at least once in Mendeley whereas
   just 55 per cent had been cited in Web of Science. Reviews are
   bookmarked more frequently than articles, and papers in English have
   more bookmarks than papers in any other language. Most users of LIS
   literature are PhD and postgraduate students.
   Originality/value - The study shows that altmetrics can be used as a
   source of data in information behaviour studies. Reference management
   software provides an unobtrusive means of capturing reading habits in
   the scholarly literature. Compared to citation counts, bookmarks are
   rapidly available and also reflect usage outside the academic community.}},

Title = {{Disciplinary differences in altmetrics for social sciences}},
Journal = {{ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{235-251}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the
   understanding of altmetrics in different disciplines of social science:
   first, by investigating the current richness and future potential of
   altmetrics in the selected social science disciplines and then by
   evaluating the validity of altmetrics as indicators of research impact
   in each discipline through correlation analysis.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses three approaches to
   understand the current richness and future potential of ten altmetric
   measures in nine selected disciplines: first, investigate the
   distribution and trend of altmetric data; second, verify the
   relationship between citation rate and altmetric presence of the
   discipline using Pearson correlation; and third, perform word frequency
   analysis on tweets to understand different altmetric presence in
   different disciplines. In addition, this study uses Spearman and sign
   test to find the correlation between altmetrics and citation counts for
   the articles that receive altmetric mention(s) to test the validity of
   altmetrics as indicators of research impact.
   Findings - There is a steady increase in the number of articles that
   receive altmetric mentions in all disciplines studied. In general,
   disciplines with higher citation rates have higher altmetric presence.
   At the same time, altmetrics are also an effective complement to
   citation in disciplines with low citation rates. There is a moderate
   correlation with Mendeley and significant but weak correlations with
   Tweets and CiteULike in seven disciplines. Altmetrics appear effective
   as a predictor of citation counts in seven out of nine disciplines
   studied. However, there is low presence and lack of correlation with
   citation count in business-finance and law disciplines.
   Originality/value - This paper furthers the understanding of altmetrics
   in social science disciplines. It reveals the disciplines where
   altmetrics are most effective, potentially useful, and fairly
   applicable. In addition, it presents evidence that altmetrics are an
   effective complement to citation in disciplines with low citation rates.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of social web-based metrics for scholarly publications
   (altmetrics) has surfaced as a complement to traditional citation-based
   metrics. Our aim was to study and characterize those recent papers in
   the field of Parkinson's disease which had received the highest
   Altmetric Attention Scores and to compare this attention measure to the
   traditional metrics. The top 20 papers in our analysis covered a variety
   of topics, mainly new disease mechanisms, treatment options and risk
   factors for the development of PD. The main media sources for these high
   attention papers were news items and Twitter. The papers were published
   predominantly in high impact journals, suggesting a correlation between
   altmetrics and conventional metrics. One paper published in a relatively
   modest journal received a significant amount of attention, reflecting
   that public attention does not always parallel the traditional metrics.
   None of the most influential papers in PD, as reviewed by Ponce and
   Lozano (2011) made it to our list, suggesting that recent publications
   receive higher attention scores, and that altmetrics may omit older,
   seminal work in the field.}},

Pages = {{213-234}},
Abstract = {{The Institutional Repositories have significant potential as sources of
   information for the preparation of metrics studies aimed at
   understanding the dynamics of institutional scientific activity.
   However, Institutional Repositories have deficiencies with regard to
   visual externalization of their vast scientific content in the form of
   bibliometric and altmetric indicators. In this context, the aim of this
   paper was to investigate the capability of national initiatives in Open
   Access Institutional Repositories in the use of bibliometric and
   altmetric indicators based on information visualization concepts. The
   research method used was the exploratory case study and the analysis
   unit comprises 81 Institutional Repositories, active in Brazilian
   Science and Technology Institutions, identified in the Directory of Open
   Access Repositories - OpenDOAR. The results achieved understood the
   identification and analysis of the presence in the Brazilian
   Institutional Repositories of bibliometric and altmetric indicators and
   its graphical visualization. It was observed that the bibliometric
   indicators showed a higher rate of occurrence in the analyzed sample
   than altmetric indicators and paucity of Institutional Repositories in
   providing the indicators using a visual representation. It is concluded
   that the discussion of the results can contribute to the understanding
   of the issues surrounding the use of Institutional Repositories, as
   sources of information for the preparation and visualization of
   bibliometric and altmetric indicators on the dynamics of scientific
   activities performed by Brazilian Science and Technology Institutions.}},

   qualitative and quantitative, descriptive in nature, and used altmetrics
   to show posts related to the term and the content analysis thereof in
   order to identify the relationships established between the term and
   associated issues. The results showed that the first publications about
   the Institutional Repository term in Portuguese on Twitter appeared in
   2009, and the highest number of tweets on the subject took place in
   2013. It highlighted the prevalence of the category ``social
   citations{''} and ``Institutional Repository Disclosure{''}, which most
   often mentions the implementation of Repositories. In posts related to
   social citation there is mention of ``Books{''} and ``Journal
   article{''}, a reference to the repository of UFBA, which provided the
   largest number of books published by the Publishing House of the
   Institution. The most frequent hashtag was \#opendoar, which is the
   official directory of academic open access repositories, developed by
   the University of Nottingham, in the UK. Finally, altmetric studies are
   considered a possibility of analysis of the relationship between social
   media and the scientific production and an alternative to disseminate

Title = {{Towards designing the Indicator for Scholarly Academic Research Impact
   based on h-index}},
Journal = {{QUALITATIVE \& QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN LIBRARIES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Present paper discusses Scholarly Academic Research Impact (SARI).
   According to J. E. Hirsch, the main criteria for devising an indicator
   are number of citations, scientific age of author, subject of the
   papers, self-citations, simplicity, universal applicability, least
   sensitive to small change of bibliographic record etc. The h-index has
   included some of these criteria. However some criteria still need to be
   incorporated during calculating h-index. Here I have tried to consider
   some relevant components to h-index for better reflection of SARI. I
   think h-index will be in core but some other measurements should be
   incorporated for better reflection of the impact. The total number of
   citations or average number of citations per article should be included
   to for calculating the SARI. G-index includes some articles having very
   high citations but does not include citations beyond hirsch's core. But
   hT-index has the provision to give weightages of all the citations of
   all the articles even beyond Hirsch's core but it is very complicated to
   understand and to calculate. The scientist having higher scientific age
   naturally will get more citations than the younger, so we need to
   incorporate this criterion when calculating SARI. Therefore technique
   should be developed to conform the relation ``SARI will be inversely
   proportional to Scientific Age of the researcher or scientist{''}. The
   SARI should have universal applicability (for author, journal,
   publisher, country etc.). Again variations among the disciplines and
   subjects need to be kept in mind when designing SARI, so that the issue
   should be normalized. The language biasness is very hard to avoid during
   designing SARI. There are so many indicators like JIF, h-index and its
   variants, altmetrics etc, but my proposal is to develop a single
   indicator which should include all the aspects of all the indicators as
   far as possible. In the present context of electronic web environment we
   have to measure societal impact along with the scholarly academic
   impact. In this regard, altmetrics. is basically the tool for weighing
   societal impact of the scholarly articles by counting number of
   downloaded, viewed, re-used, shared, liked etc. We cannot ignore these
   criteria in the social networking environment. But altmetrics is not so
   crystallized as it depends on web visibility and validation. Therefore
   present study intentionally has excluded altmetrics aspect of SARI. I
   have not given any concrete formula rather just have wanted to draw a
   theory for designing a SARI indicator based on h-index.}},

   Facebook. Moreover, the correlation between tweets and citations is
   analyzed by publication year, discipline and Twitter user type to
   explore factors affecting the correlation. The results show that Twitter
   users have a higher concern degree on Nature articles than Facebook
   users, and Nature articles have higher and faster-growing impact on
   Twitter than on Facebook. The results also show that tweets and
   citations are somewhat related, and they mostly measure different types
   of impact. In addition, the correlation between tweets and citations
   highly depends on publication year, discipline and Twitter user type.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to assess the mediating role of save, discussion, and
   recommendation measures in the relationship between visibility and
   citation in biomedical articles in 2009-2013. Path analysis method was
   used to assess the causal relationships between the variables in this
   descriptive correlational study. Systematic and random stratified
   methods were employed for sampling. The sample size was determined to be
   1892 articles using the Cochrane formula and data were gathered by using
   the PLOS altmetrics. The study's model fit indices showed that
   visibility influences citation both directly and indirectly through the
   mediating role of save. Discussion had a significant, negative role in
   the relationship between visibility and citation, and recommendation did
   not have any significant mediating role in this relationship. Among the
   social networks presenting altmetrics, it seems that networks such as
   Mendeley which provide a basis for saving scientific articles have an
   important and significant effect on the amount of future citations
   through visibility metrics. This is while social networks discussing
   scientific findings have a negative effect on the future citation of
   articles through visibility metrics. This asserts that social networks
   based on save have an influential role as the basis of scientific
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Scientists and managers using citation-based indicators to help evaluate
   research cannot evaluate recent articles because of the time needed for
   citations to accrue. Reading occurs before citing, however, and so it
   makes sense to count readers rather than citations for recent
   publications. To assess this, Mendeley readers and citations were
   obtained for articles from 2004 to late 2014 in five broad categories
   (agriculture, business, decision science, pharmacy, and the social
   sciences) and 50 subcategories. In these areas, citation counts tended
   to increase with every extra year since publication, and readership
   counts tended to increase faster initially but then stabilize after
   about 5 years. The correlation between citations and readers was also
   higher for longer time periods, stabilizing after about 5 years.
   Although there were substantial differences between broad fields and
   smaller differences between subfields, the results confirm the value of
   Mendeley reader counts as early scientific impact indicators.}},

Abstract = {{In the current UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) and the Excellence

   inherent parts of the national evaluation systems. In this study, we
   deal with a relatively new form of societal impact measurements.
   Recently, Altmetric-a start-up providing publication level
   metrics-started to make data for publications available which have been
   mentioned in policy documents. We regard this data source as an
   interesting possibility to specifically measure the (societal) impact of
   research. Using a comprehensive dataset with publications on climate
   change as an example, we study the usefulness of the new data source for
   impact measurement. Only 1.2 \% (n = 2341) out of 191,276 publications
   on climate change in the dataset have at least one policy mention. We
   further reveal that papers published in Nature and Science as well as
   from the areas ``Earth and related environmental sciences{''} and
   ``Social and economic geography{''} are especially relevant in the
   policy context. Given the low coverage of the climate change literature
   in policy documents, this study can be only a first attempt to study
   this new source of altmetrics data. Further empirical studies are
   necessary, because mentions in policy documents are of special interest
   in the use of altmetrics data for measuring target-oriented the broader

   Twitter activity are of great interest, but remain imprecisely
   quantified. We used generalized linear mixed modeling to estimate the
   relative effects of Twitter activity, journal impact factor, and time
   since publication on Web of Science citation rates of 1,599 primary
   research articles from 20 ecology journals published from 2012-2014. We
   found a strong positive relationship between Twitter activity (i.e., the
   number of unique tweets about an article) and number of citations.
   Twitter activity was a more important predictor of citation rates than
   5-year journal impact factor. Moreover, Twitter activity was not driven
   by journal impact factor; the `highest-impact' journals were not
   necessarily the most discussed online. The effect of Twitter activity
   was only about a fifth as strong as time since publication; accounting
   for this confounding factor was critical for estimating the true effects
   of Twitter use. Articles in impactful journals can become heavily cited,
   but articles in journals with lower impact factors can generate
   considerable Twitter activity and also become heavily cited. Authors may
   benefit from establishing a strong social media presence, but should not
   expect research to become highly cited solely through social media
   promotion. Our research demonstrates that altmetrics and traditional
   metrics can be closely related, but not identical. We suggest that both
   altmetrics and traditional citation rates can be useful metrics of
   research impact.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, I argue that scientific fame and impact exists on a
   continuum from the mundane to the transformative/revolutionary. Ideally,
   one achieves fame and impact in science by synthesizing two extreme
   career prototypes: intrinsic and extrinsic research. The former is
   guided by interest, curiosity, passion, gut, and intuition for important
   untapped topics. The latter is guided by money, grants, and/or what is
   being published in top-tier journals. Assessment of fame and impact in
   science ultimately rests on productivity (publication) and some
   variation of its impact (citations). In addition to those traditional
   measures of impact, there are some relatively new metrics (e.g., the h
   index and altmetrics). If psychology is to achieve consensual cumulative
   progress and better rates of replication, I propose that upcoming
   psychologists would do well to understand that success is not equal to
   fame and that individual career success is not necessarily the same as
   disciplinary success. Finally, if one is to have a successful and
   perhaps even famous career in psychological science, a good strategy
   would be to synthesize intrinsic and extrinsic motives for one's
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Speed and breadth have been suggested as two advantages of altmetrics
   over citation counts since they might estimate impact immediately after
   publication and beyond the academic community of authors. In order to
   investigate the validity of these claims, we performed a fifteen-month
   longitudinal study of the evolution of bookmarks in Mendeley for a set
   of 3813 articles published in Library and Information Science in 2014.
   Results show that 87.6\% of the literature was bookmarked at least once
   by May 2016 whereas only 55\% was cited. The correlation between
   bookmarks and citations was moderate and the overlap between the most
   frequently bookmarked and the most frequently cited papers increased
   over time. A significant share of the bookmarks were made by students
   and professionals, although the shares of bookmarks made by different
   categories of users changed as time went by. Bookmarks made by users
   based in less wealthy nations also increased over time. The study is
   limited by the incomplete information provided by Mendeley regarding
   users' academic status and country of residence, the upgrades of the
   software used in data collection, and the fact that one year is a rather
   long publication period for a longitudinal study of a fast changing
   feature like bookmarks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows how bibliometric assessment can be implemented at
   individual level. This has been successfully done at the University of
   Vienna carried out by the Department for Bibliometrics and Publication
   Strategies of the Vienna University Library. According to the
   department's philosophy, bibliometrics is not only a helpful evaluation
   instrument in order to complement the peer review system. It is also
   meant as a compass for researchers in the `publish or perish' dilemma in
   order to increase general visibility and to optimize publication
   strategies. The individual assessment comprises of an interview with the
   researcher under evaluation, the elaboration of a bibliometric report of
   the researcher's publication output, the discussion and validation of
   the obtained results with the researcher under evaluation as well as
   further optional analyses. The produced bibliometric reports are
   provided to the researchers themselves and inform them about the
   quantitative aspects of their research output. They also serve as a
   basis for further discussion concerning their publication strategies.
   These reports are eventually intended for informed peer review
   practices, and are therefore forwarded to the quality assurance and the
   Rector's office and finally sent to the peers. The most important
   feature of the generated bibliometric report is its multidimensional and
   individual character. It relies on a variety of basic indicators and
   further control parameters in order to foster comprehensibility.
   Researchers, administrative staff and peers alike have confirmed the
   usefulness of this bibliometric approach. An increasing demand is
   noticeable. In total, 33 bibliometric reports have been delivered so
   far. Moreover, similar reports have also been produced for the
   bibliometric assessment of two faculties with great success.}},

   partially assesses this hypothesis by testing whether prior articles

   general medical journals support the hypothesis, although there may not

   Results show that papers from Twitter users are 33 \% more tweeted than
   documents of non-Twitter users. From Twitter users, the increase of
   followers produces 30 \% more tweets. No differences were found between
   the citation impact (i.e. number of citations) of papers authored by
   Twitter users and non-Twitter users. However, the number of followers

Abstract = {{Altmetrics is an emergent research area whereby social media is applied
   as a source of metrics to assess scholarly impact. In the last few
   years, the interest in altmetrics has grown, giving rise to many
   questions regarding their potential benefits and challenges. This paper
   aims to address some of these questions. First, we provide an overview
   of the altmetrics landscape, comparing tool features, social media data
   sources, and social media events provided by altmetric aggregators.
   Second, we conduct a systematic review of the altmetrics literature. A
   total of 172 articles were analysed, revealing a steady rise in
   altmetrics research since 2011. Third, we analyse the results of over 80
   studies from the altmetrics literature on two major research topics:
   cross-metric validation and coverage of altmetrics. An aggregated
   percentage coverage across studies on 11 data sources shows that
   Mendeley has the highest coverage of about 59 \% across 15 studies. A
   meta-analysis across more than 40 cross-metric validation studies shows
   overall a weak correlation (ranging from 0.08 to 0.5) between altmetrics
   and citation counts, confirming that altmetrics do indeed measure a
   different kind of research impact, thus acting as a complement rather
   than a substitute to traditional metrics. Finally, we highlight open
   challenges and issues facing altmetrics and discuss future research
   areas.}},

   method to make analysis. We find that visits from social media are fast
   to accumulate but decay rapidly. Twitter and Facebook are the two most
   important social referrals that directing people to scholarly articles,
   the two are about the same and account for over 95 \% of the total
   social referral directed visits. There is synchronism between tweets and
   tweets resulted visits. Social media and open access are playing
   important roles in disseminating scholarly articles and promoting public
   understanding science, which are confirmed quantitatively for the first
   time with real data in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Novel bibliometric indexes (commonly known as altmetrics)
   are gaining interest within the scientific community and might represent
   an important alternative measure of research quality and output.
   Aims: We evaluate how these new metrics correlate with established
   bibliometric indexes such as the impact factor (IF), currently used as a
   measure of scientific production as well as a criterion for scientific
   research funding, and how they might be helpful in assessing the impact
   of research.
   Methods: We calculated altmetrics scores for all the articles published
   at our institution during a single year and examined the correlation
   between altmetrics scores and IFs as a measure of research quality and
   impact in all departments.
   Results: For all articles from the various departments published in a
   single year, the altmetrics score and the sum of all IFs showed a strong
   and significant correlation (Spearman's rho 0.88). The correlation was
   significant also when the major components of altmetrics, including
   Facebook, Twitter and Mendeley, were analyzed. The implementation of
   altmetrics has been found to be easy and effective at both the
   researcher and librarian levels.
   Conclusions: The novel bibliographic index altmetrics is consistent and
   reliable and can complement or be considered a valid alternative to
   standard bibliometric indexes to benchmark output and quality of
   research for academic and funding purposes.}},

Title = {{Healthcare hashtag index development: Identifying global impact in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{390-399}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Create an index of global reach for healthcare hashtags and
   tweeters therein, filterable by topic of interest.
   Materials and methods: For this proof-of-concept study we focused on the
   field of Primary Care and Family Medicine. Six hashtags were selected
   based on their importance, from the ones included in the `Healthcare
   Hashtag Project'. Hashtag Global Reach (HGR) was calculated using the
   additive aggregation of five weighted, normalized indicator variables:
   number of impressions, tweets, tweeters, user locations, and user
   languages. Data were obtained for the last quarter of 2014 and first
   quarter of 2015 using Symplur Signals. Topic-specific HGR were
   calculated for the top 10 terms and for sets of quotes mapped after a
   thematic analysis. Individual Global Reach, IGR, was calculated across
   hashtags as additive indexes of three indicators: replies, retweets and
   mentions.
   Results: Using the HGR score we were able to rank six selected hashtags
   and observe their performance throughout the study period. We found that
   \#PrimaryCare and \#FMRevolution had the highest HGR score in both
   quarters; interestingly, \#FMChangeMakers experienced a marked increase
   in its global visibility during the study period. ``Health Policy{''}
   was the commonest theme, while ``Care{''}, ``Family{''} and ``Health{''}
   were the most common terms.
   Discussion: This is the first study describing an altmetric hashtag
   index. Assuming analytical soundness, the Index might prove
   generalizable to other healthcare hashtags. If released as a real-time
   business intelligence tool with customizable settings, it could aid
   publishing and strategic decisions by netizens, organizations, and
   analysts. IGR could also serve to augment academic evaluation and
   professional development.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using an index on
   the global reach of healthcare hashtags and tweeters. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sleeping beauties (SB) is a term that is used to describe scientific
   articles that pass unnoticed in science for long periods of time until
   they are rediscovered. This phenomenon is little known in the scientific
   community and contradicts some of science's basic presuppositions. At
   the same time, the current reality of scientific research is defined
   according to the quantity of information that is produced. Although the
   SB field of study is little known, it has very specific characteristics
   that generate a number of cross-cutting interpretations about the way
   that science reflects on itself. This article explores three problems
   that the SB spotlights which are conceptualized within the same
   epistemological approach. We concludes that the SB analysis and the
   expected increase in the occurrence of SBs offers a point upon which to
   reflect bout epistemological frameworks of scientific practice.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical structure for defining multi-valued bibliometric indices
   is provided with the aim of measuring the impact of general sources of
   information others than articles and journals-for example, repositories

   the same time for giving a measure of the impact of a given source of
   information, that is, we construct vector valued indices. We use the
   properties of these vector valued indices in order to give a global
   answer to the problem of finding the optimal scalar index for measuring
   a particular aspect of the impact of an information source, depending on
   the criterion we want to fix for the evaluation of this impact. The main
   restrictions of our model are (1) it uses finite sets of scalar impact
   indices (altmetrics), and (2) these indices are assumed to be additive.
   The optimization procedure for finding the best tool for a fixed
   criterion is also presented. In particular, we show how to create an
   impact measure completely adapted to the policy of a specific research
   institution.}},

   by a taxonomy featuring ten Information Science research themes. The
   category ``Theoretical and general aspects of information science{''}
   was highlighted with more articles cited and a greater attention online.
   It was perceived that the two variables tend to behave similarly in
   relation to the time of publication, however, a low correlation between
   the number of mention and the number of citations for each article was
   noted. When the coefficients of the two variables weighted averages were
   calculated for thematic orientations, the correlation became moderate (P
   = 0,65). The results were similar to previous findings in the
   literature, reinforcing the potential of the Pearson's correlation
   coefficient for metric studies in information science.}},

   evaluation metrics that can be applied to a wide range of books' types
   and contents. We analyzed over 70,000 books and collected various
   metrics per each title including traditional and altmetrics measures.
   The analysis in this paper depicts the top books showing the highest
   rates of citations, reviews, readership, downloads, twitter and more.
   Our results show that books display different impact in each of the
   measurements and vary by types and content. There isn't one measure that
   captures the impact of books across the board. We conclude that books
   should be evaluated by types and contents while using different measures
   per each.}},

Abstract = {{In social tagging systems, like Mendeley, CiteULike, and BibSonomy,
   users can post, tag, visit, or export scholarly publications. In this
   paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities
   (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our
   analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published
   before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy
   are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by
   user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit
   higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that
   posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations
   and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning
   classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication
   receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year,
   based on the usage counts of the preceding year. In that setup, a Random
   Forest predictor outperforms the baseline on average by seven percentage
   points. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Medical research is highly funded and often expensive and so is
   particularly important to evaluate effectively. Nevertheless, citation
   counts may accrue too slowly for use in some formal and informal
   evaluations. It is therefore important to investigate whether
   alternative metrics could be used as substitutes. This article assesses
   whether one such altmetric, Mendeley readership counts, correlates
   strongly with citation counts across all medical fields, whether the
   relationship is stronger if student readers are excluded, and whether
   they are distributed similarly to citation counts. Based on a sample of
   332,975 articles from 2009 in 45 medical fields in Scopus, citation
   counts correlated strongly (about 0.7; 78\% of articles had at least one
   reader) with Mendeley readership counts (from the new version 1
   applications programming interface {[}API]) in almost all fields, with
   one minor exception, and the correlations tended to decrease slightly
   when student readers were excluded. Readership followed either a
   lognormal or a hooked power law distribution, whereas citations always
   followed a hooked power law, showing that the two may have underlying
   differences.}},

Abstract = {{De Marchi and Lorenzetti (Scientometrics 106(1):253-261, 2016) have
   recently argued that in fields where the journal impact factor (IF) is
   not calculated, such as in the humanities, it is key to find other
   indicators that would allow the relevant community to assess the quality
   of scholarly journals and the research outputs that are published in
   them. The authors' suggestion is that information concerning the
   journal's rejection rate and the number of subscriptions sold is
   important and should be used for such assessment. The question addressed
   by the authors is very important, yet their proposed solutions are
   problematic. Here I point to some of these problems and illustrate them
   by considering as a case in point the field of philosophy. Specifically,
   here I argue for four main claims. First, even assuming that IF provides
   a reliable indicator of the quality of journals for the assessment of
   research outputs, De Marchi and Lorenzetti have failed to validate their
   suggested indicators and proxies. Second, it has not been clarified why,
   in absence of IF, other journal-based metrics that are currently
   available should not be used. Third, the relationship between IF and
   rejection rate is more complex than the authors suggest. Fourth,
   accepting the number of sold subscriptions as a proxy would result in
   discrimination against open access journals. The upshot of my analysis
   is that the question of how to assess journals and research outputs in
   the humanities is still far from resolved.}},

Abstract = {{For the normalization of citation counts, two different kinds of methods
   are possible and used in bibliometrics: the cited-side and citing-side
   normalizations both of which can also be applied in the normalization of
   ``Mendeley reader counts{''}. Haunschild and Bornmann (2016a) introduced
   the paper-side normalization of reader counts (mean normalized reader
   score, MNRS) which is an adaptation of the cited-side normalization.
   Since the calculation of the MNRS needs further data besides data from
   Mendeley (a field-classification scheme, such as the Web of Science
   subject categories), we introduce here the reader-side normalization of
   reader counts which is an adaptation of the citing-side normalization
   and does not need further data from other sources, because self-assigned
   Mendeley disciplines are used. In this study, all articles and reviews
   of the Web of Science core collection with publication year 2012 (and a
   DOI) are used to normalize their Mendeley reader counts. The newly
   proposed indicator (mean discipline normalized reader score, MDNRS) is
   obtained, compared with the MNRS and bare reader counts, and studied
   theoretically and empirically. We find that: (i) normalization of
   Mendeley reader counts is necessary, (ii) the MDNRS is able to normalize
   Mendeley reader counts in several disciplines, and (iii) the MNRS is
   able to normalize Mendeley reader counts in all disciplines. This
   generally favorable result for the MNRS in all disciplines leads to the
   recommendation to prefer the MNRS over the MDNRS provided that the user
   has an external field-classification scheme at hand. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Altmetrics or other indicators for the impact of academic outputs are
   often correlated with citation counts in order to help assess their

   correlation strength affects the conclusions that should be drawn. In
   response, this article uses experimental simulations to assess the
   correlation strengths to be expected under various different conditions.
   The results show that the correlation strength reflects not only the
   underlying degree of association but also the average magnitude of the
   numbers involved. Overall, the results suggest that due to the number of
   assumptions that must be made, in practice it will rarely be possible to
   make a realistic interpretation of the strength of a correlation

Abstract = {{With increasing uptake among researchers, social media are finding their
   way into scholarly communication and, under the umbrella term
   altmetrics, are starting to be utilized in research evaluation. Fueled
   by technological possibilities and an increasing demand to demonstrate
   impact beyond the scientific community, altmetrics have received great
   attention as potential democratizers of the scientific reward system and
   indicators of societal impact. This paper focuses on the current
   challenges for altmetrics. Heterogeneity, data quality and particular
   dependencies are identified as the three major issues and discussed in
   detail with an emphasis on past developments in bibliometrics. The
   heterogeneity of altmetrics reflects the diversity of the acts and
   online events, most of which take place on social media platforms. This
   heterogeneity has made it difficult to establish a common definition or
   conceptual framework. Data quality issues become apparent in the lack of
   accuracy, consistency and replicability of various altmetrics, which is
   largely affected by the dynamic nature of social media events.
   Furthermore altmetrics are shaped by technical possibilities and are
   particularly dependent on the availability of APIs and DOIs, strongly
   dependent on data providers and aggregators, and potentially influenced
   by the technical affordances of underlying platforms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a survey on citation behaviour of Malaysian
   researchers. It is part of a wider study gauging quality and

   areas (humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social
   sciences) completed the questionnaire. The finding indicated that
   motivations for citing were complex and multi-faceted, but in all four
   disciplines, researchers cite a work because they regard it as an
   authoritative and trustworthy source, which provides a context or
   building block to their own research. Although researchers have moved
   from a print-based system to a digital one, it has not significantly
   changed the way they decide what to trust. Peer reviewed journals are
   still the most influential. Open access journals will be cited if they
   have been peer reviewed. Citing on the basis of high altmetrics and
   other social judgements, such as mentions, likes, and use, was not
   prevalent. Measures of establishing trust and authority do not seem to
   have changed profoundly in Malaysia.}},

Abstract = {{The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing
   concerns about the reproducibility in scientific research by conducting
   replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile
   papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published
   between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and
   Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report
   describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from
   Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in
   cancer cells by Garnett and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012
   (Garnett et al., 2012). The experiments to be replicated are those
   reported in Figures 4C, 4E, 4F, and Supplemental Figures 16 and 20.
   Garnett and colleagues performed a high throughput screen assessing the
   effect of 130 drugs on 639 cancer-derived cell lines in order to
   identify novel interactions for possible therapeutic approaches. They
   then tested this approach by exploring in more detail a novel
   interaction they identified in which Ewings sarcoma cell lines showed an
   increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Figure 4C). Mesenchymal
   progenitor cells (MPCs) transformed with the signature EWS-FLI1
   translocation, the hallmark of Ewings sarcoma family tumors, exhibited
   increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib as compared to MPCs
   transformed with a different translocation (Figure 4E). Knockdown
   mediated by siRNA of EWS-FLI1 abrogated this sensitivity to olaparib
   (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a
   collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange,
   and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.}},

Journal = {{QUALITATIVE \& QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN LIBRARIES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Since 2002, Project COUNTER has led the way in developing and
   maintaining systems of measurement for download counts. While these
   counts have often been used as a proxy measure in determining journal
   and article value for libraries and publishers, they miss an important
   post-download secondary usage factor - namely, that of sharing.
   Likewise, altmetrics, while accounting for the impact of social media,
   misses some aspects of sharing as distribution often occurs via email.
   This creates difficulty in quantifying an exact measure of use. One aim
   of the Beyond Downloads project was to develop a calculator for
   measuring total digital usage - including sharing. Through an
   examination of a range of sharing systems, we identified the most
   commonly used platforms for sharing scholarly articles, while an
   international survey provided data on access, download, saving, and
   sharing behavior. Survey results indicated that a range of sharing
   patterns can be estimated, but post-download usage often is too skewed
   to establish exact calculations. Therefore, in lieu of a sharing
   calculator, we derived ranges of sharing patterns at a confidence level
   of 95\%. These ranges vary dependent on many factors. Furthermore, our
   project highlighted the primary issues in developing a secondary usage
   calculator -namely, the lack of global standards in sharing data and the
   necessity to extend a survey data approach into a longitudinal study. As
   a consequence, we recommend a two-fold approach going forwards: 1)
   data-based approach in which a COUNTER-like universal standard for
   sharing data is developed and adopted across multiple platforms; 2)
   survey-based approach in which a longitudinal study is administered to a
   multi-disciplinary online community.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Altmetrics is a new and emerging scholarly tool that
   measures online attention surrounding journal articles. Altmetric data
   resources include: policy documents, news outlets, blogs, online
   reference managers (eg Mendeley and CiteULike), post-publication
   peer-review forums (eg PubPeer and Publons), social media (eg Twitter,
   Facebook, Weibo, Google(+), Pinterest, Reddit), Wikipedia, sites running
   Stack Exchange (Q\&A), and reviews on F1000 and YouTube. Methods To
   identify the top 50 dental articles in 2014, PubMed was searched using
   the following query ``({''}2014/1/1{''}{[}PDAT]:{''}
   2014/12/31{''}{[}PDAT]) and jsubsetd{[}text]{''} in December, 2015.
   Consequently, all PubMed records were extracted and sent to Altmetric
   LLP (London, UK) as a CSV file for examination. Data were analysed by
   Microsoft Office Excel 2010 using descriptive statistics and charts.
   Results Using PubMed searches, 15,132 dental articles were found in
   2014. The mean Altmetric score of 50 top dental articles in 2014 was
   69.5 +/- 73.3 (95\% CI: -74.14 to 213.14). The British Dental Journal
   (48\%) and Journal of Dental Research (16\%) had the maximum number of
   top articles. Twitter (67.13\%), Mendeley (15.89\%) and news outlets
   (10.92\%) were the most popular altmetric data resources. Discussion
   Altmetrics are intended to supplement bibliometrics, not replace them.
   Altmetrics is a fresh and emerging arena for the dental research
   community. We believe that dental clinical practitioners, research
   scientists, research directors and journal editors must pay more
   attention to altmetrics as a new and rapid tool to measure the social
   impact of scholarly articles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To study the publication productivity of Spanish emergency
   physicians in the 5-year period from 2010 through 2014 and compare it
   with the previous period (2005-2009).
   Methods. Articles authored by emergency physicians affiliated with
   institutions in Spain were selected from the Science Citation Index
   Expanded; conference presentations were excluded. We collected data for
   year of publication, author information, journal, the journal's impact
   factor (IF), type of article, cites received, and area of research. We
   searched at 2010-2014 period, and these data were compared with historic
   data from the 2005-2009 period.
   Results. A total of 1433 articles were published in 2010-2014; 52.4\%
   were original research articles (56\% more than in 2005-2009, P=.01).
   The mean journal IF associated with the publications was slightly higher
   in 2010-2014 (2.587 vs 2.483 for 2005-2009). The median was slightly
   lower (2.295 vs 3.085 in the earlier period), but the 90th percentile
   was higher (4.036 vs 3.085, P=0.01), reflecting an increase in the
   number of publications in journals with high IFs. Most articles continue
   to be published in Castilian Spanish (67.8\%), although the percentage
   of articles published in English increased significantly, from 25.2\% in
   the previous period to 32.1\% in 2010-2014; P=.001). Scientific
   publications in emergency medicine come mainly from specialists working
   in hospital emergency departments (89\%). Authors affiliated with a
   university are in the minority, although their percentage increased
   significantly from 10.9\% in the previous period to 16.2\% in the recent
   one (P=.001). Collaboration increased in the recent period in all
   categories: between hospitals in the same Spanish autonomous community
   (from 24.7\% to 36\%), in different communities (from 10.9\% to 19\%),
   or in different countries (from 2.3\% to 8.4\%) (P=.001, all
   comparisons). The most productive research areas were cardiovascular
   conditions (accounting for 13.1\% of the publications), infectious
   diseases (13.0\%), toxicology and pharmacology (9.2\%), pediatric
   emergencies (8.0\%), respiratory diseases (7.4\%), cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (6.7\%), and management (6.0\%). Catalonia produced the
   largest number of papers (427 {[}29.8\%]). Hospital Clinic de Barcelona
   ranked first among hospitals publishing research, with 145 articles
   (11.4\% of the total in this category); the emergency services of Madrid
   (SUMMA-112) ranked first among out-of-hospital research groups, with 43
   publications (36.7\% of the total in this category). Catalonia, Madrid,
   Castile-La Mancha, the Canary Islands, Murcia, the Balearic Islands, and
   La Rioja increased their contributions to Spanish productivity by 20\%
   or more over their output in the earlier 5-year period. Nine of the
   2010-2014 articles have already attracted enough cites to be considered
   citation classics.
   Conclusions. The productivity of Spanish emergency physicians continued
   to grow at a good pace in the 2010-2014 period. Publications in journals
   with IFs increased and there were significant changes in the dynamics of
   publication and the subjects covered.}},

Abstract = {{Since new publishing models and new communication channels are being

   and to compare them with traditional bibliometric data for the same
   articles. Also, altmetric scores for Open Access (OA) articles are
   compared to the scores for non-OA articles. The research confirms low
   correlation between the number of citations (in the first year after
   publication) and the altmetric score. Nevertheless, the altmetric score
   has a potential role in promoting articles and getting post-publication

Abstract = {{One possible way of measuring the broad impact of research (societal
   impact) quantitatively is the use of alternative metrics (altmetrics).
   An important source of altmetrics is Twitter, which is a popular
   microblogging service. In bibliometrics, it is standard to normalize
   citations for cross-field comparisons. This study deals with the
   normalization of Twitter counts (TC). The problem with Twitter data is
   that many papers receive zero tweets or only one tweet. In order to
   restrict the impact analysis on only those journals producing a
   considerable Twitter impact, we defined the Twitter Index (TI)
   containing journals with at least 80 \% of the papers with at least 1
   tweet each. For all papers in each TI journal, we calculated normalized
   Twitter percentiles (TP) which range from 0 (no impact) to 100 (highest
   impact). Thus, the highest impact accounts for the paper with the most
   tweets compared to the other papers in the journal. TP are proposed to
   be used for cross-field comparisons. We studied the field-independency
   of TP in comparison with TC. The results point out that the TP can
   validly be used particularly in biomedical and health sciences, life and
   earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, as well as physical
   sciences and engineering. In a first application of TP, we calculated
   percentiles for countries. The results show that Denmark, Finland, and
   Norway are the countries with the most tweeted papers (measured by TP).}},

Abstract = {{Background-A prior randomized controlled trial of social media exposure
   at Circulation determined that social media did not increase 30-day page
   views. Whether insufficient social media intensity contributed to these
   results is uncertain.
   Methods and Results-Original article manuscripts were randomized to
   social media exposure compared with no social media exposure (control)
   at Circulation beginning in January 2015. Social media exposure
   consisted of Facebook and Twitter posts on the journal's accounts. To
   increase social media intensity, a larger base of followers was built
   using advertising and organic growth, and posts were presented in
   triplicate and boosted on Facebook and retweeted on Twitter. The primary
   outcome was 30-day page views. Stopping rules were established at the
   point that 50\% of the manuscripts were randomized and had 30-day
   follow-up to compare groups on 30-day page views. The trial was stopped
   for futility on September 26, 2015. Overall, 74 manuscripts were
   randomized to receive social media exposure, and 78 manuscripts were
   randomized to the control arm. The intervention and control arms were
   similar based on article type (P=0.85), geographic location of the
   corresponding author (P=0.33), and whether the manuscript had an
   editorial (P=0.80). Median number of 30-day page views was 499.5 in the
   social media arm and 450.5 in the control arm; there was no evidence of
   a treatment effect (P=0.38). There were no statistically significant
   interactions of treatment by manuscript type (P=0.86), by corresponding
   author (P=0.35), by trimester of publication date (P=0.34), or by
   editorial status (P=0.79).
   Conclusions-A more intensive social media strategy did not result in
   increased 30-day page views of original research.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this article is to describe the purpose and content of
   a new branch of bibliometrics: ALMetrics (Author-Level Metrics).
   ALMetrics is focused on the quantitative analysis of an author's
   performance by measuring the dimensions of their intellectual activity
   as shown through varied metric indicators. This article will list,
   define, and classify the different metrics that are offered in newer
   information portals that showcase the scientific activity of authors.
   These metrics are grouped into five sets: bibliometrics (publication and
   citation), usage, participation, rating, social connectivity, and
   composite indicators. This new bibliometric specialty is necessary
   because of new trends in scientific assessment, which have moved
   analysis away from old bibliometrics (based on journal analysis and
   Impact Factor) towards new bibliometrics that analyze both documents and
   authors via a mix of indicators. Most importantly, ALMetrics responds to
   the researchers' desire for both knowledge and acknowledgement.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we explore the citedness of research data, its
   distribution over time and its relation to the availability of a digital
   object identifier (DOI) in the Thomson Reuters database Data Citation
   Index (DCI). We investigate if cited research data ``impacts'' the
   (social) web, reflected by altmetrics scores, and if there is any
   relationship between the number of citations and the sum of altmetrics
   scores from various social media platforms. Three tools are used to
   collect altmetrics scores, namely PlumX, ImpactStory, and Altmetric.com,
   and the corresponding results are compared. We found that out of the
   three altmetrics tools, PlumX has the best coverage. Our experiments
   revealed that research data remain mostly uncited (about 85 \%),
   although there has been an increase in citing data sets published since
   2008. The percentage of the number of cited research data with a DOI in
   DCI has decreased in the last years. Only nine repositories are
   responsible for research data with DOIs and two or more citations. The
   number of cited research data with altmetrics ``foot-prints'' is even
   lower (4-9 \%) but shows a higher coverage of research data from the
   last decade. In our study, we also found no correlation between the
   number of citations and the total number of altmetrics scores. Yet,
   certain data types (i.e. survey, aggregate data, and sequence data) are
   more often cited and also receive higher altmetrics scores.
   Additionally, we performed citation and altmetric analyses of all
   research data published between 2011 and 2013 in four different
   disciplines covered by the DCI. In general, these results correspond
   very well with the ones obtained for research data cited at least twice
   and also show low numbers in citations and in altmetrics. Finally, we
   observed that there are disciplinary differences in the availability and
   extent of altmetrics scores.}},

Abstract = {{Although Mendeley bookmarking counts appear to correlate moderately with
   conventional citation metrics, it is not known whether academic
   publications are bookmarked in Mendeley in order to be read or not.
   Without this information, it is not possible to give a confident
   interpretation of altmetrics derived from Mendeley. In response, a
   survey of 860 Mendeley users shows that it is reasonable to use Mendeley
   bookmarking counts as an indication of readership because most (55\%)
   users with a Mendeley library had read or intended to read at least half
   of their bookmarked publications. This was true across all broad areas
   of scholarship except for the arts and humanities (42\%). About 85\% of
   the respondents also declared that they bookmarked articles in Mendeley
   to cite them in their publications, but some also bookmark articles for
   use in professional (50\%), teaching (25\%), and educational activities
   (13\%). Of course, it is likely that most readers do not record articles
   in Mendeley and so these data do not represent all readers. In
   conclusion, Mendeley bookmark counts seem to be indicators of readership
   leading to a combination of scholarly impact and wider professional
   impact.}},

   the flow of nonscientific news information. An investigation on the

   online news generation as a preferential growth process. The model
   results allowed a discussion on scientific impact in public media and an
   analysis on how this impact can be influenced by authors and journals.

Abstract = {{This article introduces a new source of evidence of the value of
   medical-related research: citations from clinical guidelines. These give
   evidence that research findings have been used to inform the day-to-day
   practice of medical staff. To identify whether citations from guidelines
   can give different information from that of traditional citation counts,
   this article assesses the extent to which references in clinical
   guidelines tend to be highly cited in the academic literature and highly
   read in Mendeley. Using evidence from the United Kingdom, references
   associated with the UK's National Institute of Health and Clinical
   Excellence (NICE) guidelines tended to be substantially more cited than
   comparable articles, unless they had been published in the most recent 3
   years. Citation counts also seemed to be stronger indicators than
   Mendeley readership altmetrics. Hence, although presence in guidelines
   may be particularly useful to highlight the contributions of recently
   published articles, for older articles citation counts may already be
   sufficient to recognize their contributions to health in society.}},

Abstract = {{Social media are becoming increasingly popular in scientific
   communication. A range of platforms, such as academic social networking
   sites (SNS), are geared specifically towards the academic community.
   Proponents of the altmetrics approach have pointed out that new media
   allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment. Traditional
   impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been
   criticized for overlooking the relational dynamics of scientific impact.
   We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to
   researchers' interactions on an academic social networking site to
   generate potential new metrics of scientific impact. Based on a case
   study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars, we analyze
   how centrality measures derived from the participants' interactions on
   the academic SNS ResearchGate relate to traditional, offline impact
   indicators. We find that platform engagement, seniority, and publication
   impact contribute to members' indegree and eigenvector centrality on the
   platform, but less so to closeness or betweenness centrality. We
   conclude that a relational approach based on social network analyses of
   academic SNS, while subject to platform-specific dynamics, may add
   richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment.}},

   drives resistance to RAF inhibition through MAPK pathway
   reactivation{''} by Johannessen and colleagues, published in Nature in
   2010 (Johannessen et an, 2010). The key experiments to be replicated are
   those reported in Figures 3B, 3D-E, 31, and 4E-F. In Figures 3B, DE,
   RPMI-7951 and OUMS023 cells were reported to exhibit robust ERK/MEK
   activity concomitant with reduced growth sensitivity in the presence of
   the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. MAP3K8 (COT/ TPL2) directly regulated
   MEK/ERK phosphorylation, as the treatment of RPMI-7951 cells with a
   MAP3K8 kinase inhibitor resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of
   MEK/ERK activity (Figure 31). In contrast, MAP3K8-deficient A375 cells
   remained sensitive to BRAF inhibition, exhibiting reduced growth and
   MEK/ERK activity during inhibitor treatment. To determine if RAF and MEK
   inhibitors together can overcome single-agent resistance,
   MAP3K8-expressing A375 cells treated with PLX4720 along with MEK
   inhibitors significantly inhibited both cell viability and ERK
   activation compared to treatment with PLX4720 alone, as reported in
   Figures 4E-F. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is
   collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange

   Score, the ResearchGate's flagship indicator. Although ResearchGate
   provides features and bibliometric indicators of enormous potential in
   order to gather additional insights about the scientific and academic
   impact of authors' production, their communication policies and some
   recent actions taken in the design, development, and dissemination of
   indicators generate serious doubts regarding their use for evaluation

Abstract = {{ObjectivesAlternative-level metrics (Altmetrics) are a new method to
   assess the sharing and spread of scientific knowledge. The primary
   objective of this study was to describe the traditional metrics and
   Altmetric scores of the 50 most frequently cited articles published in
   emergency medicine (EM) journals. Since many articles related to EM are
   published in other journals, the secondary aim of this study was to
   describe the Altmetric scores of the most frequently cited articles
   relevant to EM in other biomedical journals.
   MethodsA structured search of the Institute for Scientific Information
   Web of Science version of the Science Citation Index Expanded was
   conducted. The 200 most frequently cited articles in the top 10 EM
   journals (2011 Journal Citation Report) were identified. The 200 most
   frequently cited articles from the rest of the medical literature,
   matching a predefined list of keywords relevant to the specialty of EM,
   were identified. Two authors reviewed the lists of citations for
   relevance to EM and a consensus approach was used to arrive at the final
   lists of the top 50 cited articles. The Altmetric scores for the top 50
   cited articles in EM and other journals were determined. Descriptive
   statistics and Spearman correlation were performed.
   ResultsThe highest Altmetric score for EM articles was 25.0; the mean
   (SD) was 1.9 (+/- 5.0). The EM journal with the highest mean article
   Altmetric score was Resuscitation. The main clinical areas shared for
   articles from EM articles were trauma (mean +/- SD = 11.0 +/- 15.6,
   median = 11.0) and cardiac arrest (mean +/- SD = 2.7 +/- 5.8, median =
   0). The highest Altmetric score for other journals was 176.0 (mean +/-
   SD = 23.3 +/- 40.8). The other journal with the highest mean article
   Altmetric score was the New England Journal of Medicine. The main
   clinical areas shared for articles were critical care (mean +/- SD score
   = 36.5 +/- 47.4, median = 36.5), sepsis (mean +/- SD = 24.6 +/- 48.8,
   median = 12.0), cardiology (mean +/- SD = 19.2 +/- 35.6, median = 7.0),
   and infectious diseases (mean +/- SD = 17.0 +/- 12.7, median = 17.0).
   Spearman correlation demonstrated weakly positive correlation between
   citation counts and Altmetric scores for EM articles and other journals.
   ConclusionsThis study is the first analysis of Altmetric scores for the
   top cited articles in EM. We demonstrated that there is a mild
   correlation between citation counts and Altmetric scores for the top
   papers in EM and other biomedical journals. We also demonstrated that
   there is a gap between the sharing of the top articles in EM journals
   and those related to EM in other biomedical journals. Future research to
   explore this relationship and its temporal trends will benefit the
   understanding of the reach and dissemination of EM research within the
   scientific community and society in general.}},

   identifying and confirming ceRNAs that target PTEN. In Figure 3A and B,
   they report that perturbing expression of putative PTEN ceRNAs affects
   expression of PTEN. This effect is dependent on functional microRNA

   common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a
   neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to
   2-hydroxyglutarate{''} by Ward and colleagues, published in Cancer Cell
   in 2010 (Ward et al., 2010). The experiments that will be replicated are
   those reported in Figures 2, 3 and 5. Ward and colleagues demonstrate
   the mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), commonly found in
   acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abrogate the enzyme's wild-type activity
   and confer to the mutant neomorphic activity that produces the
   oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (Figures 2 and 3). They then
   show that elevated levels of 2-HG are correlated with mutations in IDH1
   and IDH2 in AML patient samples (Figure 5). The Reproducibility Project:

   chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell
   subpopulations{''} by Sharma and colleagues, published in Cell in 2010
   (Sharma et al., 2010). Sharma and colleagues demonstrated that prolonged
   exposure of cancer cells to TKIs give rise to small populations of
   ``drug tolerant persisters{''} (DTPs) (Figure 1 B-C) that were reversed
   during subsequent maintenance under drug-free conditions (Figures 1E, 2B
   and 2E). DTPs exhibited reduced histone acetylation and sensitivity to
   HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) (Figure 4A-B). Drug sensitivity was restored with
   co-treatment of either HDIs or an IGF-1R inhibitor, in combination with
   TKIs (Figure 5A-B). Inhibition of IGF-1R activation also led to
   decreased KDM5A expression and restoration of H3K4 methylation,
   suggesting a direct link between the IGF-1R signaling pathway and KDM5A
   function (Figure 7A, 7C, and 71). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer

   243 to histidine (R243H) mutation in the Gprotein a subunit GNAO1 in

   demonstrated that stable expression of mutant GNAO1(R243D) conferred a
   significant growth advantage in human mammary epithelial cells,
   confirming the oncogenic potential of this mutation. Similarly,
   expression of variants with somatic mutations in MAP2K4, a JNK pathway
   kinase (shown in Figures 4C-E) resulted in a significant increase in

   reduced kinase activity compared to wild type MAP2K4, indicating these

   which provide very similar numbers and trends. While the percentage of
   citable items with a DOI has already reached 90\% in the Sciences and
   the Social Sciences in 2014, it has remained much lower in the Arts \&

   Books and Proceedings are even lower despite the importance of these
   document types, particularly for the Social Sciences and the Arts \&
   Humanities. The fact that there are still journals with a large number
   of items still lacking DOIs in 2014 should be alarming for the
   corresponding editors and should give them reason to enhance the formal
   quality and visibility of their journals. Finally, scientists are also
   encouraged to review their publication strategies and to favour
   publication channels with established DOI assignments. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{As research performance becomes increasingly important for academic
   institutions in competition for rankings, student recruitment, and
   funding, many performance indicators have been developed to measure
   various aspects of research performance. ResearchGate combines
   bibliometrics and altmetrics to create a more comprehensive performance
   measure for researchers and institutions. The ResearchGate score, the
   flagship indicator calculated by an undisclosed algorithm, is a metric
   that measure scientific reputation. In this research, ResearchGate
   metrics are firstly compared with those that Research Excellence
   Framework (REF) and Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings
   to assess the quality of UK universities and global universities
   respectively. This study then utilizes correlation analysis to examine
   whether ResearchGate metrics demonstrate effectiveness on the researcher
   level in comparison with SciVal metrics. For this research, 300
   ResearchGate members from the supply chain management field were
   selected. The results provide empirical evidence that demonstrate that
   the ResearchGate score can be an effective indicator for measuring
   individual researcher performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A different number of citations can be expected for publications
   appearing in different subject categories and publication years. For
   this reason, the citation-based normalized indicator Mean Normalized
   Citation Score (MNCS) is used in bibliometrics. Mendeley is one of the
   most important sources of altmetrics data. Mendeley reader counts
   reflect the impact of publications in terms of readership. Since a
   significant influence of publication year and discipline has also been
   observed in the case of Mendeley reader counts, reader impact should not
   be estimated without normalization. In this study, all articles and
   reviews of the Web of Science core collection with a publication year of
   2012 (and a DOI) are used to normalize their Mendeley reader counts. A
   new indicator that determines the normalized reader impact is
   obtained-the Mean Normalized Reader Score (MNRS) - and compared with the
   MNCS. The MNRS enables us to compare the impact a paper has had on
   Mendeley across subject categories and publication years. Comparisons on
   the journal and university level show that the MNRS and MNCS correlate
   larger for 9601 journals than for 76 German universities. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the publication rate
   of Canadian health sciences librarians, post-conference presentation.
   Discover barriers that prevent librarians from taking conference
   presentation to full publication. Assess the metrics available to
   librarians for scholarly output measurement by examining metrics,
   traditional and altmetrics, of articles resulting from conference
   presentation.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey using FluidSurveys was
   distributed via e-mail to authors of poster and papers presentation
   presented at Canadian Health Libraries Association/Association des
   bibliothSques de la sante du Canada conferences from 2004 to 2009. A
   literature search for articles matching presentations in National
   Library of Medicine's PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
   Health Literature and Library, Information Science \& Technology
   Abstracts was conducted to determine publication rate. Metrics of
   retrieved articles were gathered and analyzed to gage scholarly output
   of Canadian health sciences librarians.
   Findings - A publication rate of 31.5 percent was determined by
   literature search. Time restriction was the most common reported reason
   for not publishing. The altmetric analysis included 71 articles, of
   which 52 percent had at least one value in various metrics, with
   Mendeley counts being the most common value represented.
   Research limitations/implications - Not all survey respondents may be
   library science professionals, so that survey findings may not be
   generalizable to the Canadian health librarian profession. While every
   effort was made to find and confirm publications related to conference
   presentations, the reported publication rate may be either an over
   estimate or under estimate of the true rate. Current altmetric science
   is very dynamic and evolving.
   Originality/value - This study provides a baseline publication rate,
   identifies barriers librarians face to publication and provides a
   glimpse into the state of metrics available to Canadian librarians for
   evaluation of their scholarly output.}},

Title = {{Relationship between citation counts and Mendeley readership metrics A
   case of top 100 cited papers in Physics}},
Journal = {{NEW LIBRARY WORLD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{229-238}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Social media has given way for the development of various new
   altmetric indicators. Mendeley readership count is one such indicator.
   The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the paper aims to
   investigate the relationship between citation counts and Mendeley
   readership counts. The paper also evaluates the relationship between
   Mendeley readership metrics for two different time periods, thereby
   investigating its nature as an altmetric indicator.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using the Scopus
   database. Top 100 papers in Physics published during 2005 as well as in
   2010 that received the largest number of citations were selected.
   Mendeley readership data were collected using Mendeley readership
   statistics for documents indexed in Scopus. For establishing a
   relationship between citation counts and Mendeley readership,
   correlation was calculated between the citations in Scopus database and
   Mendeley readership. The difference in Mendeley readership for different
   time periods was also investigated.
   Findings - The paper showed that for both the years, Mendeley readership
   counts were in positive correlation with citation counts. For the year
   2010, it was found that Mendeley readership counts were in strong
   positive correlation with citation counts, whereas for 2005, they were
   in moderate positive correlation.
   Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of this paper
   is that with time more scientists and researchers may join Mendeley
   causing various changes in data and giving different results. Also, the
   paper has focused on the highly cited papers in Physics.
   Originality/value - Very few studies have been conducted in the area of
   altmetrics, as it is a comparatively new and emerging field of research.
   The findings of this paper offer insights to the question whether
   Mendeley readership counts can be used as an alternative to traditional
   sources of bibliometric indicators like citations, h-index, etc. The
   paper also evaluates the difference in the nature of traditional
   bibliometric indicators and Mendeley readership counts.}},

Journal = {{EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{16-33}},
Abstract = {{Objective - This paper explores how to utilize two well-known library
   databases, Thomson Reuter's Web of Science and Elsevier's Scopus, to
   quantify Long Island educational institutions' scholarly productivity.
   Methods - Institutions located in the Long Island region and within
   Nassau and Suffolk counties, including the State University of New York
   (SUNY) colleges, private institutions, and technical schools, were
   examined for the last 14 years (2000-2013). Eight Long Island
   institutions were represented in both databases and were included in the
   study.
   Results - Of the eight institutions, Stony Brook University produced the
   most publications indexed in Web of Science and Scopus during the period
   of 2000-2013. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory yielded the second most
   publications during 2000-2013 in both Web of Science and Scopus, but it
   produced the highest quality publications compared with other
   institutions excluding Stony Brook University. Although the annual
   growth rates of Farmingdale State College and New York Institute of
   Technology increased dramatically in both Web of Science and Scopus, the
   large proportional increase did not represent a large increase in total
   value. Additionally, some institutions had a higher number of
   publications indexed in Web of Science than in Scopus, and others had a
   higher number of publications indexed in Scopus than in Web of Science.
   Conclusions - Data were collected from institutions in Long Island with
   various institutional sizes, the number of faculty members employed may
   have made an impact on the number of publications. Thus, publication
   data in this study cannot be used to compare their rankings.
   Institutions with a similar type and similar size of faculty members
   should be selected for comparison. Due to the different coverage and
   scope of Web of Science and Scopus, institutions should use both
   databases to examine their scholarly output. Furthermore, institutions
   should consider using altmetrics to capture various impacts of the
   scholarly output to complement the traditional metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective - To determine faculty's information behaviour and their
   perception of academic libraries in the current transition between print
   and electronic scholarly communication.
   Design - Online survey.
   Setting - A consortium of 12 large universities in Spain.
   Subjects - More than 17,380 faculty members.
   Methods - The researchers used a questionnaire based on a subset of the
   questionnaire used for the Ithaka S+R Faculty Survey, with 20 closed and
   2 open-ended questions. The survey was implemented via Google Forms and
   sent through mailing lists. The number of recipients was not known, but
   university statistics for 11 of the 12 universities list 17,380 faculty
   (statistics were not available for one university, located in a
   different administrative area). The questions aimed to identify the
   types of documents used by scholars for teaching and research, the
   search tools used, the strategies used to keep up-to-date in their
   disciplines, preferences for print or electronic books, the sources used
   to access documents, their preferred channels to disseminate their own
   research, and their views regarding library services.
   Main Results - The response rate was 12.7\%. Based on the results,
   scholarly journals were the most used information resource for research
   across all academic disciplines, with 94\% of respondents rating them as
   important. For teaching, faculty preferred to use textbooks for
   undergraduates, and journal articles for Master's students. To search
   the literature, faculty chose bibliographic databases and Internet
   search engines over the library catalog and physical collections,
   although the catalog was the first choice for known-item searches.
   Respondents favored print to read entire books or chapters but preferred
   the electronic format for skimming. Of the respondents, 78\% rated the
   library as an important channel to access resources, while 61\% also
   considered free online materials important. If the material was not
   available at their library, 71\% frequently chose to search for a free
   online version and 42\% used the inter-library loan service. For their
   own research, faculty have published in scholarly journals more often
   than other channels and have selected the journal based on its impact
   factor (77.5\% ranked it as important) and on its area of coverage
   (73.4\%). When asked to rank library services, faculty placed paying for
   resources highest, with 86.2\% identifying it as important. Next were
   facilitating teaching and helping students develop information literacy
   skills. Finally, a majority of faculty considered themselves highly
   dependent on the library.
   Conclusion - Journal articles are the most widely used information
   resource for research and teaching purposes, regardless of discipline.
   This includes arts and humanities, which are known for heavy monograph
   usage. Articles are also scholars' preferred channel for publishing.
   With regards to books, faculty have mixed feelings about print and
   electronic formats. Spanish faculty display information behaviours
   similar to their British and American counterparts, as documented in the
   Ithaka S+R 2012 surveys. Blogs and social networks are not widely used
   in spite of growing attention to such channels for research output and
   altmetrics. Open access is also relatively unimportant for faculty when
   they choose where to publish. A majority of respondents still consider
   library services as important, for collections as well as teaching and
   learning support, which may present opportunities for librarians.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objective: The emergence of the Internet and social
   media is having a powerful influence on the ways in which researchers
   discover, access, process and communicate information. The methods used
   by systems measuring the impact of a scientific paper used during the
   last forty years, and questioned, are demonstrating more clearly
   insufficient in this new context, they do not provide information of all
   interactions that occur in the new social media. Altmetrics emerges as a
   complementary resource and does not exclude traditional metrics to
   provide a richer view of the influence of an investigation. Method:
   Narrative review. This article presents an analysis of the implications
   of altmetrics, advantages, disadvantages, and achievements made.
   Results: It is considered that altmetrics provides a broader view of the
   social implications of research beyond the purely academic. Discussion:
   While it is not easy to disentangle what is the meaning of altmetrics
   and what kind of impact accurately measures. Conclusions: altmetrics
   although it is not yet considered by the agencies of scientific
   accreditation, is already being used by some of the most important
   publishers, as it provides an immediate picture of the impact of an
   investigation, and ultimately may be a mechanism to predict the future
   academic impact of research, there are still many aspects to consider as
   all related to standardization of sources and methods of compilation of
   the results, but we can say that has altmetrics come and will have to be
   taken into account in the immediate future by lso accreditation bodies
   and research funding.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the impact of scientific publications of
   the Italian SIMPAR (Study In Multidisciplinary PAin Research) group by
   using altmetrics, defined as nontraditional metrics constituting an
   alternative to more traditional citation-impact metrics, such as impact
   factor and H-index. By correlating traditional and alternative metrics,
   we attempted to verify whether publications by the SIMPAR group
   collectively had more impact than those performed by its individual
   members, either in solo publications or in publications coauthored by
   non-SIMPAR group investigators (which for the purpose of this study we
   will refer to as ``individual publications{''}). For all the 12 members
   of the group analyzed (pain therapists, biologists, and
   pharmacologists), we created Open Researcher and Contributor ID and
   Impact Story accounts, and synchronized these data. Manually, we
   calculated the level metrics for each article by dividing the data
   obtained from the research community by those obtained from the public
   community. We analyzed 759 articles, 18 of which were published by the
   SIMPAR group. Altmetrics demonstrated that SIMPAR group publications
   were more likely to be saved (77.8\% vs 45.9\%), discussed (61.1\% vs
   1.1\%, P<0.0001), and publicly viewed (11.1\% vs 1.3\%, P=0.05) than
   individual publications. These results support the importance of
   multidisciplinary research groups in the impact of scientific
   literature; the interaction and synergy among the research participants
   allowed the obtainment of high impact-literature in the field of
   personalized pain medicine. Finally, our findings demonstrate the
   potential of altmetrics in estimating the value of the research products
   of a group.}},

Abstract = {{Objective - In order to inform a library service related to creating and
   maintaining online scholarly profiles, we sought to assess the knowledge
   base and needs of our academic communities. Participants were queried
   about use, issues, and attitudes toward scholarly profile and altmetric
   tools, as well as the role librarians could play in assisting with the
   curation of online reputation.
   Methods - Semi-structured interviews with 18 scholar-practitioners and 5
   graduate students from two mid-sized universities.
   Results - While all participants had Googled themselves, few were
   strategic about their online scholarly identity. Participants affirmed
   the perception that altmetrics can be of value in helping to craft a
   story of the value of their research and its diverse outputs. When
   participants had prior knowledge of altmetrics tools, it tended to be
   very narrow and deep, and perhaps field-specific. Participants
   identified time as the major barrier to use of scholarly profile and
   altmetrics tools.
   Conclusions - Librarians are well-placed to assist scholar-practitioners
   who wish to curate an online profile or use altmetrics tools. Areas of
   assistance include: personalized support, establishment of goals,
   orientation to specific tools, orientation to altmetrics and scholarly
   promotion landscape, preparing users for potential difficulties,
   discussing copyright implications, Open Access education, and guidance
   with packaging content for different venues and audiences.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{149-164}},
Abstract = {{In the past few decades the core of bibliometrics has predominantly been
   `scientometric' in nature, due to the first commercial citation index
   having been created for scientific journals and articles. The production
   of citation indexes for books implies that proper education related to
   their use is now becoming critical. A new breed of humanistic
   bibliometrician can emerge successfully if well-trained lecturers are
   prepared to provide students with a foundation in mathematical indicator
   construction and a stimulating environment dedicated to problem-oriented
   learning. We examine some of the key principles and practices associated
   with teaching bibliometrics to humanists, with the aim of encouraging
   students to reflect upon new indicators relevant to scholarly research
   outputs across the humanities. Emphasis is placed on the ``biblio{''} in
   bibliometrics (i. e., books), digital record-keeping across the
   humanities, the work of humanists who have sought to explain the
   development of new knowledge through objective pattern-seeking, and the
   complementary value of alternative versus traditional indicators of
   scholarly research performance.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, articles can attract readers on the social reference sharing

   investigates the influence of time on the number of Mendeley readers of

   the relationship between counts of readers of, and citations to, 4
   general library and information science (LIS) journals. For this
   discipline, it takes about 7 years for articles to attract as many
   Scopus citations as Mendeley readers, and after this the Spearman
   correlation between readers and citers is stable at about 0.6 for all
   years. This suggests that Mendeley readership counts may be useful
   impact indicators for both newer and older articles. The lack of dates
   for individual Mendeley article readers and an unknown bias toward more
   recent articles mean that readership data should be normalized
   individually by year, however, before making any comparisons between

Abstract = {{This brief communication presents preliminary findings on automated

   presence of such bots from the perspective of social media metrics

   suggested as a means of measuring impact that is both broader and

   accounts create a considerable amount of tweets to scientific articles
   and that they behave differently than common social bots, which has
   critical implications for the use of raw tweet counts in research
   evaluation and assessment. We discuss some definitions of Twitter
   cyborgs and bots in scholarly communication and propose distinguishing

   tweeting only bibliographic information to discussing or commenting on

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential of
   altmetric and webometric indicators to aid with funding agencies'
   evaluations of their funding schemes.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses a range of altmetric
   and webometric indicators in terms of suitability for funding scheme
   evaluations, compares them to traditional indicators and reports some
   statistics derived from a pilot study with Wellcome Trust-associated
   publications.
   Findings - Some alternative indicators have advantages to usefully
   complement scientometric data by reflecting a different type of impact
   or through being available before citation data.
   Research limitations/implications - The empirical part of the results is
   based on a single case study and does not give statistical evidence for
   the added value of any of the indicators.
   Practical implications - A few selected alternative indicators can be
   used by funding agencies as part of their funding scheme evaluations if
   they are processed in ways that enable comparisons between data sets.
   Their evidence value is only weak, however.
   Originality/value - This is the first analysis of altmetrics or

   research work is mentioned within a specific context. We followed a
   group of researchers and professionals with Twitter profiles who had
   published at least 3 articles in the journal EPI between 2009 and 2013.
   The research methodology was qualitative using virtual ethnography based
   on non-participant observation. Among the main conclusions, we found
   that researchers use Twitter mostly as a way to make their professional
   activity public and to disseminate their own research works or those of
   close collaborators, in order to give them more visibility and impact.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming to explore the applicability of bookmarking data in measuring the

   between conventional impact indicators (i.e. impact factors and mean
   citations) and bookmarking metrics (mean bookmarks and percentage of
   bookmarked articles) at author and journal aggregation levels in library
   and information science (LIS) field. Applying the citation analysis
   method, it studies a purposeful sample of LIS articles indexed in SSCI
   during 2004-2012 and bookmarked in CiteULike. Data are collected via
   WoS, Journal Citation Report, and CiteULike. There is a positive, though
   weak, correlation between LIS authors' mean citations and their mean
   bookmarks, as well as a moderate to large correlation between LIS
   journals' impact factors on the one hand and on the other, their mean
   bookmarks, and the percentage of their bookmarked articles. Given the
   correlation between the citation- and bookmark-based indicators at
   author and journal levels, bookmarking data can be used as a complement
   to, but not a substitute for, the traditional indicators to get to a
   more inclusive evaluation of journals and authors.}},

Abstract = {{An abstract construction for general weighted impact factors is
   introduced. We show that the classical weighted impact factors are
   particular cases of our model, but it can also be used for defining new
   impact measuring tools for other sources of information-as repositories

   altmetrics. Our aim is to show the main mathematical properties of this
   class of impact measuring tools, that hold as consequences of their
   mathematical structure and does not depend on the definition of any
   given index nowadays in use. In order to show the power of our approach
   in a well-known setting, we apply our construction to analyze the
   stability of the ordering induced in a list of journals by the 2-year
   impact factor (). We study the change of this ordering when the
   criterium to define it is given by the numerical value of a new weighted
   impact factor, in which is used for defining the weights. We prove that,
   if we assume that the weight associated to a citing journal increases
   with its , then the ordering given in the list by the new weighted
   impact factor coincides with the order defined by the . We give a
   quantitative bound for the errors committed. We also show two examples
   of weighted impact factors defined by weights associated to the prestige
   of the citing journal for the fields of MATHEMATICS and MEDICINE,

   Although journal articles dominate academic research in the health and

   not always possible to get useful citation-based impact indicators for
   these due to their absence from, or incomplete coverage in, traditional
   citation indexes. In this context, the web is particularly valuable as a
   potential source of impact indicators for non-standard academic outputs.
   The main focus in this review is on books because of the much greater
   amount of relevant research for them and because they are regarded as

Abstract = {{A number of indicators and metrics have been devised, especially in the
   past 10 to 15 years, to assist scholars in making a case for themselves
   and for their work. These metrics describe the impact of traditional
   venues (i.e. scholarly journals) as well as the impact of the scholars
   based on the number of times their work has been cited in traditional
   and nontraditional venues. Academic librarians assist faculty in
   explaining their impact and productivity in their respective fields in
   part through information published to their websites. Terms/concepts
   associated with common metrics relating to scholarly impact were
   searched in the library websites of the 62 Association of American
   University (AAU) members. A total of 61 libraries had web pages or
   LibGuides providing information on these topics, with Journal Citation
   Reports and the Impact Factor being the most commonly discussed (100\%;
   98.4\%). Slightly over 90\% (90.2\%) supplied information about the
   h-index and 80.3\% addressed altmetrics. We conclude that AAU librarians
   are assisting with the understanding and use of both traditional and new
   metrics as part of their service to their community of users. (C) 2015

Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The number of papers published in journals indexed by the Web of Science
   core collection is steadily increasing. In recent years, nearly two
   million new papers were published each year; somewhat more than one
   million papers when primary research papers are considered only
   (articles and reviews are the document types where primary research is
   usually reported or reviewed). However, who reads these papers? More
   precisely, which groups of researchers from which (self-assigned)
   scientific disciplines and countries are reading these papers? Is it
   possible to visualize readership patterns for certain countries,
   scientific disciplines, or academic status groups? One popular method to
   answer these questions is a network analysis. In this study, we analyze
   Mendeley readership data of a set of 1,133,224 articles and 64,960
   reviews with publication year 2012 to generate three different networks:
   (1) The network based on disciplinary affiliations of Mendeley readers
   contains four groups: (i) biology, (ii) social sciences and humanities
   (including relevant computer sciences), (iii) bio-medical sciences, and
   (iv) natural sciences and engineering. In all four groups, the category
   with the addition ``miscellaneous{''} prevails. (2) The network of
   co-readers in terms of professional status shows that a common interest
   in papers is mainly shared among PhD students, Master's students, and
   postdocs. (3) The country network focusses on global readership
   patterns: a group of 53 nations is identified as core to the scientific
   enterprise, including Russia and China as well as two thirds of the OECD
   (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces the Multidimensional Research Assessment Matrix
   of scientific output. Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics
   to be applied in a research assessment process depends on the unit of
   assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and
   policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful
   within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance,
   publication counts are useful tools to help discriminate between those
   staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of
   little value if active scientists are to be compared with one another
   according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic
   account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10
   important metrics, including altmetrics, applied at the level of
   individual articles, individual researchers, research groups, and
   institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions and
   indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each
   dimension. It introduces the concept of a meta-analysis of the units
   under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate
   individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the
   objectives and general setup of an assessment process.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive analysis of the presence of different altmetric indicators
   provided by Altmetric.com across scientific fields is presented,
   particularly focusing on their relationship with citations. Our results
   confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts
   are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications,
   with 15\%-24\% of the publications presenting some altmetric activity
   and concentrated on the most recent publications, although their
   presence is increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences,
   humanities, and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence
   of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these
   fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and
   citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but is
   relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect
   the same kind of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not
   always present a better filtering of highly-cited publications than
   journal citation scores. Altmetric scores (particularly mentions in
   blogs) are able to identify highly-cited publications with higher levels
   of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but they have a lower
   level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of
   citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to
   disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for
   research evaluation.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},

Abstract = {{The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing
   concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting
   replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile
   papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published
   between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and
   Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered report
   describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from `A
   coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates
   tumour biology' by Poliseno et al. (2010), published in Nature in 2010.
   The key experiments to be replicated are reported in Figures 1D, 2F-H,
   and 4A. In these experiments, Poliseno and colleagues report microRNAs
   miR-19b and miR-20a transcriptionally suppress both PTEN and PTENP1 in
   prostate cancer cells (Figure 1D; Poliseno et al., 2010). Decreased
   expression of PTEN and/or PTENP1 resulted in downregulated PTEN protein
   levels (Figure 2H), downregulation of both mRNAs (Figure 2G), and
   increased tumor cell proliferation (Figure 2F; Poliseno et al., 2010).
   Furthermore, overexpression of the PTEN 3' UTR enhanced PTENP1 mRNA
   abundance limiting tumor cell proliferation, providing additional
   evidence for the co-regulation of PTEN and PTENP1 (Figure 4A; Poliseno
   et al., 2010). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is
   collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange,
   and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.}},

   a whole, although the indicators that these generate are now probably
   too broad and too dominated by automatically generated websites, such as
   library and publisher catalogues, to be useful in practice. More
   valuable web-based indicators can be derived from specific types of web
   pages that cite academic research, such as online presentations, course
   syllabi, and science blogs. These provide evidence that is easier to
   understand and use and less likely to be affected by unwanted types of

Abstract = {{This literature review assesses indicators derived from social media
   sources, including both general and academic sites. Such indicators have
   been termed altmetrics, influmetrics, social media metrics, or a type of
   webometric, and have recently been commercialised by a number of
   companies and employed by some publishers and university administrators.
   The social media metrics analysed here derive mainly from Twitter,
   Facebook, Google+, F1000, Mendeley, ResearchGate, and Academia. edu.
   They have the apparent potential to deliver fast, free indicators of the
   wider societal impact of research, or of different types of academic
   impacts, complementing academic impact indicators from traditional
   citation indexes. Although it is unwise to employ them in formal
   evaluations with stakeholders, due to their susceptibility to gaming and
   lack of real evidence that they reflect wider research impacts, they are
   useful for formative evaluations and to investigate science itself.
   Mendeley reader counts are particularly promising.}},

   MLL-fusions compared to those with alternate oncogenic drivers. In

Abstract = {{Little detailed information is known about who reads research articles
   and the contexts in which research articles are read. Using data about
   people who register in Mendeley as readers of articles, this article
   explores different types of users of Clinical Medicine, Engineering and
   Technology, Social Science, Physics, and Chemistry articles inside and
   outside academia. The majority of readers for all disciplines were PhD
   students, postgraduates, and postdocs but other types of academics were
   also represented. In addition, many Clinical Medicine articles were read
   by medical professionals. The highest correlations between citations and
   Mendeley readership counts were found for types of users who often
   authored academic articles, except for associate professors in some
   sub-disciplines. This suggests that Mendeley readership can reflect
   usage similar to traditional citation impact if the data are restricted
   to readers who are also authors without the delay of impact measured by
   citation counts. At the same time, Mendeley statistics can also reveal
   the hidden impact of some research articles, such as educational value
   for nonauthor users inside academia or the impact of research articles
   on practice for readers outside academia.}},

Abstract = {{The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing
   concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by replicating
   selected results from a substantial number of high-profile papers in the
   field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010
   and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores
   (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered report describes the proposed
   replication plan of key experiments from `Wnt activity defines colon
   cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment' by Vermeulen
   and colleagues, published in Nature Cell Biology in 2010 (Vermeulen et
   al., 2010). The key experiments that will be replicated are those
   reported in Figures 2F, 6D, and 7E. In these experiments, Vermeulen and
   colleagues utilize a reporter for Wnt activity and show that colon
   cancer cells with high levels of Wnt activity also express cancer stem
   cell markers (Figure 2F; Vermeulen et al., 2010). Additionally,
   treatment either with conditioned medium derived from myofibroblasts or
   with hepatocyte growth factor restored clonogenic potential in low Wnt
   activity colon cancer cells in vitro (Figure 6D; Vermeulen et al., 2010)
   and in vivo (Figure 7E; Vermeulen et al., 2010). The Reproducibility
   Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1459-1464}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the traditional tools of calculation for a journal's
   efficacy and visibility with the new tools that have arrived from the
   Internet, social media and search engines. The examples concern
   publications of orthopaedic surgery and in particular International
   Orthopaedics.
   Until recently, the prestige of publications, authors or journals was
   evaluated by the number of citations using the traditional citation
   metrics, most commonly the impact factor. Over the last few years,
   scientific medical literature has developed exponentially. The Internet
   has dramatically changed the way of sharing and the speed of flow of
   medical information. New tools have allowed readers from all over the
   world to access information and record their experience. Web platforms
   such as FacebookA (R) and TwitterA (R) have allowed for inputs from the
   general public. Professional sites such as LinkedInA (R) and more
   specialised sites such as ResearchGateA (R), BioMed CentralA (R) and
   OrthoEvidenceA (R) have provided specific information on defined fields
   of science. Scientific and professional blogs provide free access
   quality information. Therefore, in this new era of advanced wireless
   technology and online medical communication, the prestige of a paper
   should also be evaluated by alternative metrics (altmetrics) that
   measure the visibility of the scientific information by collecting
   Internet citations, number of downloads, number of hits on the Internet,
   number of tweets and likes of scholarly articles by newspapers, blogs,
   social media and other sources of data.
   This article provides insights into altmetrics and informs the reader
   about current tools for optimal visibility and citation of their work.
   It also includes useful information about the performance of
   International Orthopaedics and the bias between traditional publication
   metrics and the new alternatives.}},

   analysis of federal statistics}},
Journal = {{GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{246-252}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This paper examines how federal statistics is used in scholarly
   research via a new type of citation analysis that leverages the
   strengths of information aggregators, like Altmetric LLP, in looking for
   evidence of government information use beyond traditional
   citations/references. In this citation analysis, abstracts were
   examined.
   Results: Drawing on a dataset containing articles aggregated via
   Altmetric Explorer, a querying interface provided by Altmetric LLP,
   content analysis was used to 1) determine the distribution of federal
   statistics incorporated in scholarly studies, and 2) qualitatively
   understand the particular ways in which studies incorporated federal
   statistics. It was found that the dominant source of federal statistics
   was the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), followed by the
   Census Bureau, and then the Bureau of labor Statistics. Prevalent
   qualitative themes underlying the studies in this dataset included
   mortality and population studies, linked datasets, international
   studies, and critical studies (i.e. presenting alternative measures for
   federal statistics).
   Conclusions: When querying studies referencing one or more of the
   principal US statistical agencies in Altmetric Explorer, almost all
   studies in the final dataset cited these agencies because they had cited
   federal statistics. This finding need not have been the case however. A
   separate study on the use of federal statistics in scholarly research
   will compare altmetrics to traditional citation analysis. Preliminary
   results from Google Scholar, using traditional citations, found
   non-dataset publications to be the most frequently cited titles from
   NCHS and the Census Bureau. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An important and timely plenary session at the 2015 UKSG Conference and
   Exhibition focused on the role of metrics in research assessment. The
   two excellent speakers had slightly divergent views. Todd Carpenter from
   the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) argued that
   altmetrics are not alt(ernative) any more and that downloads and other
   forms of digital interaction, including social media reference,
   reference tracking, personal library saving and secondary linking
   activity now provide mainstream approaches to the assessment of
   scholarly impact. James Wilsdon is Professor of Science \&. Democracy in
   the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex and
   is Chair of the Independent Review of the Role of Metrics in Research
   Assessment commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for
   England (HEFCE). The outcome of this review will inform the work of
   HEFCE and the other UK higher education funding bodies as they prepare
   for the future of the Research Excellence Framework (REF). He is more
   circumspect, arguing that metrics cannot and should not be used as a
   substitute for informed judgement. This article provides a summary of

Abstract = {{The increased interest in an impact measurement of research on other
   areas of the society than research has led in scientometrics to an
   investigation of altmetrics. Particular attention is paid here to a
   targeted broad impact measurement: The aim is to discover the impact
   which a particular publication set has on specific user groups (outside
   research) by using altmetrics. This study used the Mendeley application
   programming interface (API) to download the Mendeley counts (broken down
   by different user types of publications in Mendeley) for a comprehensive
   F1000Prime data set. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system
   for papers from the biomedical area. As the F1000 papers are provided
   with tags from experts in this area (Faculty members) which can
   characterise a paper more exactly (such as ``good for teaching{''} or
   ``new finding{''}), the interest of different user groups in
   specifically tagged papers could be investigated. This study's
   evaluation of the variously tagged F1000 papers provided interesting
   insights into the use of research papers by different user groups. The
   most interesting tag for altmetrics research is ``good for teaching{''}.
   This applies to papers which are well written and provide an overview of
   a topic. Papers with this tag can be expected to arouse interest among
   people who are hardly or not at all involved in research. The results of
   the regression models in this study do in fact show that lecturers,
   researchers at a non-academic institution, and others (such as
   librarians) have a special interest in this kind of papers. In the case
   of a key article in a field, or a particularly well written article that
   provides a good overview of a topic, then it will tend to be better
   received by people which are not particularly related to academic
   research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the volume of individuals
   who viewed online versions of research articles in 2 peer-reviewed
   radiology journals and a radiology blog promoted by social media.
   Methods: The authors performed a retrospective study comparing online
   analytic logs of research articles in the American Journal of
   Neuroradiology (AJNR) and the American Journal of Roentgenology (AIR)
   and a blog posting on Radiopaedia.org from April 2013 to September 2014.
   All 3 articles addressed the topic of reporting incidental thyroid
   nodules detected on CT and MRI. The total page views for the research
   articles and the blog article were compared, and trends in page views
   were observed. Factors potentially affecting trends were an AJNR podcast
   and promotion of the blog article on the social media platforms
   Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter to followers of Radiopaedia.org in
   February 2014 and August 2014.
   Results: The total numbers of page views during the study period were
   2,421 for the AJNR article and 3,064 for the AIR article. The
   Radiopaedia.org blog received 32,675 page views, which was 13.6 and 10.7
   times greater than AJNR and AIR page views, respectively, and 6.0 times
   greater than both journal articles combined. Months with activity above
   average for the blog and the AJNR article coincided with promotion by
   Radiopaedia.org on social media.
   Conclusions: Dissemination of scientific material on a radiology blog
   promoted on social media can substantially augment the reach of more
   traditional publication venues. Although peer-reviewed publication
   remains the most widely accepted measure of academic productivity,
   researchers in radiology should not ignore opportunities for increasing
   the impact of research findings via social media.}},

Abstract = {{Publication of research, innovation, challenges and successes is of
   critical importance to the evolution of more effective distance
   education programming. Publication in peer reviewed journal format is
   the most prestigious and the most widespread form of dissemination in
   education and most other disciplines, thus the importance of
   understanding what is published and its impact on both researchers and
   practitioners. In this article we identify and classify the leading
   articles in arguably the leading peer reviewed journals in this
   discipline.
   The journal The International Review of Research in Open and Distance
   Learning (IRRODL) is a peer reviewed academic journal that has been
   published since 2000. The journal has published between 3 and 6 issues
   annually with between 50 and 111 research articles per volume. In order
   to assess the general and the particular impact of highly cited articles
   this work describes the main bibliometric indicators of the IRRODL
   journal and these are compared with the total galley views in all
   formats, PDF, HTML, EPUB and MP3, that IRRODL publishes. In addition to
   identifying characteristics of the most widely cited articles this
   research determines if there is a correlation between the articles most
   highly cited by other publishing researchers and the number of views,
   indicating interest from both practitioners and research communities.
   The results show a significant and positive relationship between the
   total number of citations and the number of views received by articles
   published in the journal, indicating the impact of the journal extends
   beyond active publishers to practitioner consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative metrics are currently one of the most popular research
   topics in scientometric research. This paper provides an overview of
   research into three of the most important altmetrics: microblogging
   (Twitter), online reference managers (Mendeley and CiteULike) and
   blogging. The literature is discussed in relation to the possible use of
   altmetrics in research evaluation. Since the research was particularly
   interested in the correlation between altmetrics counts and citation
   counts, this overview focuses particularly on this correlation. For each
   altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its correlation with
   traditional citation counts. As the results of the meta-analyses show,
   the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging counts is
   negligible (pooled r = 0.003), for blog counts it is small (pooled r =
   0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, medium to
   large (CiteULike pooled r = 0.23; Mendeley pooled r = 0.51).}},

Abstract = {{Journal impact factors (JIFs) are widely used and promoted but have
   important limitations. In particular, JIFs can be unduly influenced by
   individual highly cited articles and hence are inherently unstable. A
   logical way to reduce the impact of individual high citation counts is
   to use the geometric mean rather than the standard mean in JIF
   calculations. Based upon journal rankings 2004-2014 in 50 sub-categories
   within 5 broad categories, this study shows that journal rankings based
   on JIF variants tend to be more stable over time if the geometric mean
   is used rather than the standard mean. The same is true for JIF variants
   using Mendeley reader counts instead of citation counts. Thus, although
   the difference is not large, the geometric mean is recommended instead
   of the arithmetic mean for future JIF calculations. In addition,
   Mendeley readership-based JIF variants are as stable as those using
   Scopus citations, confirming the value of Mendeley readership as an
   academic impact indicator. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A number of new metrics based on social media platforms-grouped under
   the term ``altmetrics{''} - have recently been introduced as potential
   indicators of research impact. Despite their current popularity, there
   is a lack of information regarding the determinants of these metrics.
   Using publication and citation data from 1.3 million papers published in
   2012 and covered in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science as well as social
   media counts from Altmetric. com, this paper analyses the main patterns
   of five social media metrics as a function of document characteristics
   (i.e., discipline, document type, title length, number of pages and
   references) and collaborative practices and compares them to patterns
   known for citations. Results show that the presence of papers on social
   media is low, with 21.5\% of papers receiving at least one tweet, 4.7\%
   being shared on Facebook, 1.9\% mentioned on blogs, 0.8\% found on
   Google+ and 0.7\% discussed in mainstream media. By contrast, 66.8\% of
   papers have received at least one citation. Our findings show that both
   citations and social media metrics increase with the extent of
   collaboration and the length of the references list. On the other hand,
   while editorials and news items are seldom cited, it is these types of
   document that are the most popular on Twitter. Similarly, while longer
   papers typically attract more citations, an opposite trend is seen on
   social media platforms. Finally, contrary to what is observed for
   citations, it is papers in the Social Sciences and humanities that are
   the most often found on social media platforms. On the whole, these
   findings suggest that factors driving social media and citations are
   different. Therefore, social media metrics cannot actually be seen as
   alternatives to citations; at most, they may function as complements to
   other type of indicators.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of article-level metrics of 27,856 PLOS ONE articles reveals
   that the number of tweets was weakly associated with the number of
   citations (beta = 0.10), and weakly negatively associated with citations
   when the number of article views was held constant (beta = -0.06). The
   number of tweets was predictive of other social media activity (beta =

   of article views on PubMed Central (beta = 0.01). It is concluded that

Abstract = {{In this paper, I present the evaluation of a novel knowledge domain the
   visualisation of educational technology. The interactive visualisation
   is based on readership patterns in the online reference management

   technologies, and social and technological developments. The
   visualisation was evaluated with: (1) a qualitative comparison to
   knowledge domain visualisations based on citations, and (2) expert
   interviews. The results show that the co-readership visualisation is a
   recent representation of pedagogical and psychological research in
   educational technology. Furthermore, the co-readership analysis covers
   more areas than comparable visualisations based on co-citation patterns.
   Areas related to computer science, however, are missing from the
   co-readership visualisation and more research is needed to explore the
   interpretations of size and placement of research areas on the map.}},

Journal = {{ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{682-697}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand individual
   academics' perception, attitudes and participation in Open Access
   Publishing and open scholarship and revisit some principles and designs
   of openness in academic publishing from the perspective of creative
   end-users, which helps to increase the sustainability and efficiency of
   open models.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a case study of China
   and empirical data collected through semi-structured interviews with a
   wide range of academics and stakeholders.
   Findings - A separation between the communication and certification
   functions of publishing is identified: open initiatives are valued for
   efficient and interactive communication while traditional publishing
   still dominates the legitimacy of research publications, which leads to
   the quandary of individual academics operating within the transitional
   landscape of scholarly communication.
   Practical implications - Practical recommendations for sustainable and
   efficient openness are derived from discussions on the difficulties
   associated open/social certification and the shifting maxims that govern
   academics from ``publish or perish{''} to ``be visible or vanish{''}.
   Originality/value - ``Openness{''} is defined in broad sense integrating
   Open Access and open scholarship to comprehensively reflect individual
   academics' views in the transitional landscape of academic publishing.
   The research findings suggest that new open approaches are needed to
   address the evolving tension and conflicts between communication and
   certification.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of social media, including social networking technologies,
   has had a profound impact on almost all human activities. Social media's
   application in research is the most recent occurrence, as the
   technologies have gained prominence among researchers who regard social
   media as an avenue for not only strengthening their own networks, but
   also sharing their research. This article focuses on one of the social
   networking services for researchers, namely ResearchGate (RG), to assess
   the research visibility and impact of universities in South Africa. It
   also examines the correlation between the universities'
   ResearchGate-based metrics and Web of Science (WoS) citation statistics
   on the one hand, and the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities'
   (WRWU) ranking on the other. Results reveal that researchers in the
   top-ranking South African universities have quickly moved to embrace
   social media; there is a high correlation between RG and WoS in terms of
   their coverage of papers produced by universities in South Africa; there
   is also a high correlation between RG and WoS in terms of impact; and
   ranking of universities in RG, WoS and WRWU is similarly highly
   correlated. Further discussions, conclusions and recommendations are
   provided in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the disciplinary
   orientation of scientific publications that were mentioned on different
   social media platforms, focussing on their differences and similarities
   with citation counts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Social media metrics and readership
   counts, associated with 500,216 publications and their citation data
   from the Web of Science database, were collected from Altmetric.com and
   Mendeley. Results are presented through descriptive statistical analyses
   together with science maps generated with VOSviewer.
   Findings - The results confirm Mendeley as the most prevalent social
   media source with similar characteristics to citations in their
   distribution across fields and their density in average values per
   publication. The humanities, natural sciences, and engineering
   disciplines have a much lower presence of social media metrics. Twitter
   has a stronger focus on general medicine and social sciences. Other
   sources (blog, Facebook, Google+, and news media mentions) are more
   prominent in regards to multidisciplinary journals.
   Originality/value - This paper reinforces the relevance of Mendeley as a
   social media source for analytical purposes from a disciplinary
   perspective, being particularly relevant for the social sciences
   (together with Twitter). Key implications for the use of social media
   metrics on the evaluation of research performance (e.g. the
   concentration of some social media metrics, such as blogs, news items,
   etc., around multidisciplinary journals) are identified.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the value of Goodreads
   reader ratings for measuring the wider impact of scholarly books
   published in the field of History.
   Design/methodology/approach - Book titles were extracted from the
   reference lists of articles that appeared in 604 history journals
   indexed in Scopus (2007-2011). The titles were cleaned and matched with
   WorldCat.org (for publisher information) as well as Goodreads (for
   reader ratings) using an API. A set of 8,538 books was first filtered
   based on Dewey Decimal Classification class 900 ``History and
   Geography{''}, then a subset of 997 books with the highest citations and
   reader ratings (i.e. top 25 per cent) was analysed separately based on
   additional characteristics.
   Findings - A weak correlation (0.212) was found between citation counts
   and reader rating counts for the full data set (n = 8,538). An
   additional correlation for the subset of 997 books indicated a similar
   weak correlation (0.190). Further correlations between citations, reader
   ratings, written reviews, and library holdings indicate that a reader
   rating on Goodreads was more likely to be given to a book held in an
   international library, including both public and academic libraries.
   Originality/value - Research on altmetrics has focused almost
   exclusively on scientific journal articles appearing on social media
   services (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). In this paper we show the potential
   of Goodreads reader ratings to identify the impact of books beyond
   academia. As a unique altmetric data source, Goodreads can allow
   scholarly authors from the social sciences and humanities to measure the
   wider impact of their books.}},

Pages = {{356-371}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that there were
   differences in the use of Twitter by professors at AAU schools.
   Affordance use differed between the personal and professional tweets of
   professors as categorized by turkers. Framing behaviors were described
   that could impact the interpretation of tweets by audience members.
   Design/methodology/approach - A three phase research design was used
   that included surveys of professors, categorization of tweets by workers
   in Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and categorization of tweets by active
   professors on Twitter.
   Findings - There were significant differences found between professors
   that reported having a Twitter account, significant differences found
   between types of Twitter accounts (personal, professional, or both), and
   significant differences in the affordances used in personal and
   professional tweets. Framing behaviors were described that may assist
   altmetric researchers in distinguishing between personal and
   professional tweets.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by the sample
   population, survey instrument, low survey response rate, and low Cohen's
   kappa.
   Practical implications - An overview of various affordances found in
   Twitter is provided and a novel use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk for the
   categorization of tweets is described that can be applied to future
   altmetric studies.
   Originality/value - This work utilizes a socio-technical framework
   integrating social and psychological theories to interpret results from
   the tweeting behavior of professors and the interpretation of tweets by
   workers in Amazon's Mechanical Turk.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging metrics based on article-level does not exclude traditional
   metrics based on citations to the journal, but complements them. Both
   can be employed in conjunction to offer a richer picture of an article

   result of the aggregation of different data sources and the collection
   of content from multiple social network services. Sources used for the
   aggregation can be broken down into five categories: usage, captures,
   mentions, social media and citations. Data sources depend on the tool,
   but they include classic metrics indicators based on citations, academic
   social networks (Mendeley, CiteULike, Delicious) and social media
   (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, or Youtube, among others). Altmetrics is not
   synonymous with alternative metrics. Altmetrics are normally early
   available and allow to assess the social impact of scholarly outputs,
   almost at the real time. This paper overviews briefly the meaning of
   altmetrics and describes some of the existing tools used to apply this

Abstract = {{Alternative metrics (altmetrics) as a possible substitute for or

   equally authoritative participants in the market of scientific
   publications. Altmetrics are already used actively by the largest
   publishers; in June 2014, the American National Information Standards
   Organization developed a draft altmetrics standard. This article
   presents a review of the existing indicators, describes their target

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze the adequacy and applicability of readership
   statistics recorded in social reference management systems for creating
   knowledge domain visualizations. First, we investigate the distribution
   of subject areas in user libraries of educational technology researchers
   on Mendeley. The results show that around 69\% of the publications in an
   average user library can be attributed to a single subject area. Then,
   we use co-readership patterns to map the field of educational
   technology. The resulting visualization prototype, based on the most
   read publications in this field on Mendeley, reveals 13 topic areas of
   educational technology research. The visualization is a recent
   representation of the field: 80\% of the publications included were
   published within ten years of data collection. The characteristics of
   the readers, however, introduce certain biases to the visualization.
   Knowledge domain visualizations based on readership statistics are
   therefore multifaceted and timely, but it is important that the
   characteristics of the underlying sample are made transparent. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this study is to contribute to the
   understanding of how the potential of altmetrics varies around the world
   by measuring the percentage of articles with non-zero metrics (coverage)
   for articles published from a developing region (Latin America).
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses article metadata from a
   prominent Latin American journal portal, SciELO, and combines it with
   altmetrics data from Altmetric.com and with data collected by
   author-written scripts. The study is primarily descriptive, focusing on
   coverage levels disaggregated by year, country, subject area, and
   language.
   Findings - Coverage levels for most of the social media sources studied
   was zero or negligible. Only three metrics had coverage levels above 2
   per cent - Mendeley, Twitter, and Facebook. Of these, Twitter showed the
   most significant differences with previous studies. Mendeley coverage
   levels reach those found by previous studies, but it takes up to two
   years longer for articles to be saved in the reference manager. For the
   most recent year, coverage was less than half than what was found in
   previous studies. The coverage levels of Facebook appear similar (around
   3 per cent) to that of previous studies.
   Research limitations/implications - The Altmetric.com data used for some
   of the analyses were collected for a six month period. For other
   analyses, Altmetric. com data were only available for a single country
   (Brazil).
   Originality/value - The results of this study have implications for the
   altmetrics research community and for any stakeholders interested in
   using altmetrics for evaluation. It suggests the need of careful sample
   selection when wishing to make generalizable claims about altmetrics.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this case study is to investigate the
   usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader impact of research.
   Design/methodology/approach - This case study is based on a sample of
   1,082 the Public Library of Science (PLOS) journal articles recommended
   in F1000. The data set includes altmetrics which were provided by PLOS.
   The F1000 data set contains tags on papers which were assigned by
   experts to characterise them.
   Findings - The most relevant tag for altmetric research is ``good for
   teaching{''}, as it is assigned to papers which could be of interest to
   a wider circle of readers than the peers in a specialised area. One
   could expect papers with this tag to be mentioned more often on Facebook
   and Twitter than those without this tag. The results from regression
   models were able to confirm these expectations: papers with this tag
   show significantly higher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers
   without this tag. This clear association could not be seen with Mendeley
   or Figshare counts (that is with counts from platforms which are chiefly
   of interest in a scientific context).
   Originality/value - The results of the current study indicate that
   Facebook and Twitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, might provide an
   indication of which papers are of interest to a broader circle of
   readers (and not only for the peers in a specialist area), and could
   therefore be useful for the measurement of the societal impact of

   Ciencia da Informacao obtained better results than the others, with 21
   articles and 297 altmetrics data. In regards to social media, around
   92,43\% of the data collected was taken from Mendeley's library, while
   7,57\% of the mentions were from Twitter, and no data was recovered from
   Facebook. We consider that the lack of standardization for magazines can
   be a factor in the reduced quantity of articles found, and the
   parameterization of Application Programming Interface of social media
   such as Facebook and Twitter can be the answer to overcome this low
   number for the recovered data. The altmetric data indicates the

Abstract = {{This study explores the connections between social and usage metrics
   (altmetrics) and bibliometric indicators at the author level. It studies
   to what extent these indicators, gained from academic sites, can provide
   a proxy for research impact. Close to 10,000 author profiles belonging
   to the Spanish National Research Council were extracted from the
   principal scholarly social sites: ResearchGate, Academia.edu and
   Mendeley and academic search engines: Microsoft Academic Search and
   Google Scholar Citations. Results describe little overlapping between
   sites because most of the researchers only manage one profile (72\%).
   Correlations point out that there is scant relationship between
   altmetric and bibliometric indicators at author level. This is due to
   the almetric ones are site-dependent, while the bibliometric ones are
   more stable across web sites. It is concluded that altmetrics could
   reflect an alternative dimension of the research performance, close,
   perhaps, to science popularization and networking abilities, but far
   from citation impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Relationship amongst ResearchGate altmetric indicators and Scopus
   bibliometric indicators The case of Panjab University Chandigarh (India)}},
Journal = {{NEW LIBRARY WORLD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{9-10}},
Pages = {{564-577}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the study aims to
   investigate the relationship between the altmetric indicators from
   ResearchGate (RG) and the bibliometric indicators from the Scopus
   database. Second, the study seeks to examine the relationship amongst
   the RG altmetric indicators themselves. RG is a rich source of altmetric
   indicators such as Citations, RGScore, Impact Points, Profile Views,
   Publication Views, etc.
   Design/methodology/approach - For establishing whether RG metrics showed
   the same results as the established sources of metrics, Pearson's
   correlation coefficients were calculated between the metrics provided by
   RG and the metrics obtained from Scopus. Pearson's correlation
   coefficients were also calculated for the metrics provided by RG. The
   data were collected by visiting the profile pages of all the members who
   had an account in RG under the Department of Physics, Panjab University,
   Chandigarh (India).
   Findings - The study showed that most of the RG metrics showed strong
   positive correlation with the Scopus metrics, except for RGScore (RG)
   and Citations (Scopus), which showed moderate positive correlation. It
   was also found that the RG metrics showed moderate to strong positive
   correlation amongst each other.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is that
   more and more scientists and researchers may join RG in the future,
   therefore the data may change. The study focuses on the members who had
   an account in RG under the Department of Physics, Panjab University,
   Chandigarh (India). Perhaps further studies can be conducted by
   increasing the sample size and by taking a different sample size having
   different characteristics.
   Originality/value - Being an emerging field, not much has been conducted
   in the area of altmetrics. Very few studies have been conducted on the
   reach of academic social networks like RG and their validity as sources
   of altmetric indicators like RGScore, Impact Points, etc. The findings
   offer insights to the question whether RG can be used as an alternative
   to traditional sources of bibliometric indicators, especially with
   reference to a rapidly developing country such as India.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{520-536}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to detect and describe
   disciplinary differences in the users and use of several social
   networking sites by scientists.
   Design/methodology/approach - Consejo Superior de Investigaciones
   Cientificas (CSIC) (Spanish National Research Council) researchers
   registered in the most currently relevant academic social network sites
   (Google Scholar Citations, Academia.edu, ResearchGate (RG) and Mendeley)
   were analysed. In total, 6,132 profiles were classified according the
   eight research areas of the CSIC.
   Findings - Results show that Academia.edu is massively populated by
   humanists and social scientists, while RG is popular among biologists.
   Disciplinary differences are observed across every platform. Thus,
   scientists from the humanities and social sciences and natural resources
   show a significant activity contacting other members. On the contrary,
   biologists are more passive using social tools.
   Originality/value - This is the first study that analyses the
   disciplinary performance of a same sample of researchers on a varied
   number of academic social sites, comparing their numbers across web
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{Research output and impact metrics derived from commercial citation
   databases such as Web of Science and Scopus have become the de facto
   indicators of scholarly performance across different disciplines and
   regions. However, it has been pointed out that the existing metrics are
   largely inadequate to reflect scholars' overall peer-mediated
   performance, especially in the social sciences and humanities (SSH)
   where publication channels are more diverse. In this paper alternative
   metrics exploring a variety of formal and informal communication
   channels were proposed, with the aim of better reflecting SSH
   scholarship. Data for a group of SSH scholars in Taiwan on these metrics
   were collected. Principal component analysis revealed four underlying
   dimensions represented by the 18 metrics. Multiple-regression analyses
   were then performed to examine how well each of these dimensions
   predicted the academic standing of the scholars, measured by the number
   of public grants awarded and prestigious research awards received.
   Differences in the significance of the predictors were found between the
   social sciences and humanities. The results suggest the need to consider
   disciplinary differences when evaluating scholarly performance.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Activity of modern scholarship creates online footprints galore. Along
   with traditional metrics of research quality, such as citation counts,
   online images of researchers and institutions increasingly matter in
   evaluating academic impact, decisions about grant allocation, and
   promotion. We examined 400 biographical Wikipedia articles on academics
   from four scientific fields to test if being featured in the world's
   largest online encyclopedia is correlated with higher academic
   notability (assessed through citation counts). We found no statistically
   significant correlation between Wikipedia articles metrics (length,
   number of edits, number of incoming links from other articles, etc.) and
   academic notability of the mentioned researchers. We also did not find
   any evidence that the scientists with better WP representation are
   necessarily more prominent in their fields. In addition, we inspected
   the Wikipedia coverage of notable scientists sampled from Thomson
   Reuters list of `highly cited researchers'. In each of the examined
   fields, Wikipedia failed in covering notable scholars properly. Both
   findings imply that Wikipedia might be producing an inaccurate image of
   academics on the front end of science. By shedding light on how public
   perception of academic progress is formed, this study alerts that a
   subjective element might have been introduced into the hitherto
   structured system of academic evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The prospects of altmetrics are especially encouraging for research
   fields in the humanities that currently are difficult to study using
   established bibliometric methods. Yet, little is known about the
   altmetric impact of research fields in the humanities. Consequently,
   this paper analyses the altmetric coverage and impact of
   humanities-oriented articles and books published by Swedish universities
   during 2012. Some of the most common altmetric sources are examined
   using a sample of 310 journal articles and 54 books. Mendeley has the
   highest coverage of journal articles (61\%) followed by Twitter (21\%)
   while very few of the publications are mentioned in blogs or on
   Facebook. Books, on the other hand, are quite often tweeted while both
   Mendeley's and the novel data source Library Thing's coverage is low.
   Many of the problems of applying bibliometrics to the humanities are
   also relevant for altmetric approaches; the importance of non-journal
   publications, the reliance on print as well the limited coverage of
   non-English language publications. However, the continuing development
   and diversification of methods suggests that altmetrics could evolve
   into a valuable tool for assessing research in the humanities.}},

Abstract = {{Altmetrics, indices based on social media platforms and tools, have
   recently emerged as alternative means of measuring scholarly impact.
   Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social
   environments, and interact with scholarly products in the social web. We
   tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media
   environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians examining both their
   own use of online platforms and the use of their papers on social
   reference managers. As expected, coverage varied: 82 \% of articles
   published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley
   libraries, while only 28 \% were included in CiteULike. Mendeley
   bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation counts.
   We conducted a survey among the participants of the STI2012
   participants. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools
   were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools
   varied widely. 68 \% of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while
   Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of
   respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which
   they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians
   had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72 \% valued download
   counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in
   blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether,
   these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use
   by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source
   of impact data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an analysis of the presence and possibilities of
   altmetrics for bibliometric and performance analysis is carried out.
   Using the web based tool Impact Story, we collected metrics for 20,000
   random publications from the Web of Science. We studied both the
   presence and distribution of altmetrics in the set of publications,
   across fields, document types and over publication years, as well as the
   extent to which altmetrics correlate with citation indicators. The main
   result of the study is that the altmetrics source that provides the most
   metrics is Mendeley, with metrics on readerships for 62.6\% of all the
   publications studied, other sources only provide marginal information.
   In terms of relation with citations, a moderate spearman correlation (r
   = 0.49) has been found between Mendeley readership counts and citation
   indicators. Other possibilities and limitations of these indicators are
   discussed and future research lines are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Citations are increasingly used for research evaluations. It is
   therefore important to identify factors affecting citation scores that
   are unrelated to scholarly quality or usefulness so that these can be
   taken into account. Regression is the most powerful statistical
   technique to identify these factors and hence it is important to
   identify the best regression strategy for citation data. Citation counts
   tend to follow a discrete lognormal distribution and, in the absence of
   alternatives, have been investigated with negative binomial regression.
   Using simulated discrete lognormal data (continuous lognormal data
   rounded to the nearest integer) this article shows that a better
   strategy is to add one to the citations, take their log and then use the
   general linear (ordinary least squares) model for regression (e. g.,
   multiple linear regression, ANOVA), or to use the generalised linear
   model without the log. Reasonable results can also be obtained if all
   the zero citations are discarded, the log is taken of the remaining
   citation counts and then the general linear model is used, or if the
   generalised linear model is used with the continuous lognormal
   distribution. Similar approaches are recommended for altmetric data, if
   it proves to be lognormally distributed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Academics can now use the web and the social websites to disseminate
   scholarly information in a variety of different ways. Although some
   scholars have taken advantage of these new online opportunities, it is
   not clear how widespread their uptake is or how much impact they can
   have. This study assesses the extent to which successful scientists have
   social web presences, focusing on one influential group: highly cited
   researchers working at European institutions. It also assesses the
   impact of these presences. We manually and systematically identified if
   the European highly cited researchers had profiles in Google Scholar,
   Microsoft Academic Search, Mendeley, Academia and LinkedIn or any
   content in SlideShare. We then used URL mentions and altmetric
   indicators to assess the impact of the web presences found. Although
   most of the scientists had an institutional website of some kind, few
   had created a profile in any social website investigated, and
   LinkedIn-the only non-academic site in the list-was the most popular.
   Scientists having one kind of social web profile were more likely to
   have another in many cases, especially in the life sciences and
   engineering. In most cases it was possible to estimate the relative
   impact of the profiles using a readily available statistic and there
   were disciplinary differences in the impact of the different kinds of
   profiles. Most social web profiles had some evidence of uptake, if not
   impact; nevertheless, the value of the indicators used is unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Today, it is not clear how the impact of research on other areas of
   society than science should be measured. While peer review and
   bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of
   research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which
   to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to
   distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting
   option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new
   ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is
   a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and
   other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e.
   g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential
   of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the
   definition and classification of altmetrics. Furthermore, their benefits
   and disadvantages for measuring impact are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Can altmetric data be validly used for the measurement of societal
   impact? The current study seeks to answer this question with a
   comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate
   sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of
   Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular
   tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of
   interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The
   results show that papers with the tag ``good for teaching{''} do achieve
   higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of
   the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is
   shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically
   scientifically oriented ({''}new finding{''}). The findings indicate
   that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research
   should lead to societal impact.
   If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact,
   the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations
   are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This
   study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible
   normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are
   particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide
   audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely
   reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric
   data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the
   level of topics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{490-496}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. Traditional measures of the impact of published research,
   such as citation counts, are limited to measuring academic impact. The
   use of social media and other online tools as alternative measures of
   research impact is gaining popularity and used by leading medical
   journals.
   Methods. MEDLINE was searched for articles published with subject
   headings relating to solid organ transplantation between August 1, 2011,
   and July 31, 2012. Citation data were retrieved from SCOPUS, and
   statistics regarding mentions in social media, social bookmarking sites,
   news outlets, and expert recommendation sites were retrieved from the
   data at www.altmetric.com. Data were analyzed for associations between
   alternative metric data and citation rates.
   Results. The search retrieved 6,981 publications. Sixty-six percent of
   the articles had at least one citation. Mentions in social media were
   19.3\%, 13.1\% had social bookmarks, 0.9\% had expert recommendations,
   and online news outlets picked up eight articles. Significantly higher
   citation rates were associated with mention in social media, expert
   recommendation, social bookmarking, and for articles identified as
   meta-analyses, multicenter studies, randomized controlled trials, and
   reviews (all P<0.001). The odds of an article being highly cited were
   significantly increased by a mention in social media (odds ratio, 2.58;
   P<0.001). Qualitative analysis suggests that article topics discussed on
   social media are more likely to relate to the more controversial and
   emotive areas of transplantation.
   Discussion. Social media and online attention act as early predictors of
   the impact of transplant research as measured by later citation rate.
   Blogging and expert recommendation, in particular, are associated with
   higher citation rates.}},

Abstract = {{Because Twitter and other social media are increasingly used for
   analyses based on altmetrics, this research sought to understand what
   contexts, affordance use, and social activities influence the tweeting
   behavior of astrophysicists. Thus, the presented study has been guided
   by three research questions that consider the influence of
   astrophysicists' activities (i.e., publishing and tweeting frequency)
   and of their tweet construction and affordance use (i.e. use of
   hashtags, language, and emotions) on the conversational connections they
   have on Twitter. We found that astrophysicists communicate with a
   variety of user types (e.g. colleagues, science communicators, other
   researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the
   astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different
   professional roles can be distinguished. Interestingly, the analysis of
   noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address
   the different groups of very different professional composition they use
   very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.e.
   mentioning other user names in tweets). The results also showed that in
   those areas of the ego networks that tweeted more the sentiment of the
   tweets tended to be closer to neutral, connecting frequent tweeting with
   information sharing activities rather than conversations or expressing
   opinions.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is evidence that counting the readers of an article in
   the social reference site, Mendeley, may help to capture its research
   impact, the extent to which this is true for different scientific fields
   is unknown. In this study, we compare Mendeley readership counts with
   citations for different social sciences and humanities disciplines. The
   overall correlation between Mendeley readership counts and citations for
   the social sciences was higher than for the humanities. Low and medium
   correlations between Mendeley bookmarks and citation counts in all the
   investigated disciplines suggest that these measures reflect different
   aspects of research impact. Mendeley data were also used to discover
   patterns of information flow between scientific fields. Comparing
   information flows based on Mendeley bookmarking data and
   cross-disciplinary citation analysis for the disciplines revealed
   substantial similarities and some differences. Thus, the evidence from
   this study suggests that Mendeley readership data could be used to help
   capture knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines, especially for
   people that read but do not author articles, as well as giving impact
   evidence at an earlier stage than is possible with citation counts.}},

Abstract = {{Despite nearly 350years of practice, we still do a fairly poor job of
   measuring the quality and impact of scholarly papers and the work of
   individual researchers. Much of our system for determining funding and
   career advancement revolves around one metric: the impact factor.
   Technology has progressed to a point where we can do better. We can now
   track the life of each individual paper after it has been published and
   better understand how it is read and how it is used. This creates a
   tremendous opportunity for new alternative metrics ({''}altmetrics{''})
   to give us a much better sense of a paper's true impact. At the same
   time, we are now faced with an overwhelming quantity of information and
   seemingly unlimited ways to analyze a researcher's work. How do we
   separate out the digital needles from the haystack-the signal from the
   noise-and create useful tools for research assessment?}},

   which Altmetric.com retrieves data. However five of them cover 95.5\% of

   potential limitations on its exhaustiveness as well as on the selection

   studied the presence of these authors in social networks and the impact

   Scholar Profiles and 70\% had an account on both Linkedln and Mendeley.
   This platform has served as the tool with higher statistics and obtained
   the highest correlation with the number of citations in Web of Science
   (0.516). Other networks were Twitter (55\%) and Slideshare (47\%);
   despite its lower presence in the sample, Slideshare offers users higher
   visibility, receiving the highest number of user hits. We also present

   study is to propose a method in which a webometric analysis is used to
   select the most suitable Web sites for a specific case study and to
   obtain information about users. The proposed webometric analysis
   consists of an integrated formula including visibility, popularity, and

Abstract = {{The rise of the social web and its uptake by scholars has led to the
   creation of altmetrics, which are social web metrics for academic
   publications. These new metrics can, in theory, be used in an evaluative
   role, to give early estimates of the impact of publications or to give
   estimates of non-traditional types of impact. They can also be used as
   an information seeking aid: to help draw a digital library user's
   attention to papers that have attracted social web mentions. If
   altmetrics are to be trusted then they must be evaluated to see if the
   claims made about them are reasonable. Drawing upon previous citation
   analysis debates and web citation analysis research, this article
   discusses altmetric evaluation strategies, including correlation tests,
   content analyses, interviews and pragmatic analyses. It recommends that
   a range of methods are needed for altmetric evaluations, that the
   methods should focus on identifying the relative strengths of influences
   on altmetric creation, and that such evaluations should be prioritised
   in a logical order.}},

Title = {{Astrophysicists on Twitter An in-depth analysis of tweeting and
   scientific publication behavior}},
Journal = {{ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{279-296}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the tweeting behavior
   of 37 astrophysicists on Twitter and compares their tweeting behavior
   with their publication behavior and citation impact to show whether they
   tweet research-related topics or not.
   Design/methodology/approach - Astrophysicists on Twitter are selected to
   compare their tweets with their publications from Web of Science.
   Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication
   frequency.
   Findings - A moderate negative correlation (rho- -0.339) is found
   between the number of publications and tweets per day, while retweet and
   citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and
   abstracts is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting
   behavior such as retweeting and including hashtags, usernames and URLs.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is limited in terms of the
   small set of astrophysicists. Results are not necessarily representative
   of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter and they most
   certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should
   apply the methods to a larger set of researchers and other scientific
   disciplines.
   Practical implications - To a certain extent, this study helps to
   understand how researchers use Twitter. The results hint at the fact
   that impact on Twitter can neither be equated with nor replace
   traditional research impact metrics. However, tweets and other so-called
   altmetrics might be able to reflect other impact of scientists such as
   public outreach and science communication.
   Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first
   in-depth study comparing researchers' tweeting activity and behavior
   with scientific publication output in terms of quantity, content and
   impact.}},

Title = {{Correlation and Interaction Visualization of Altmetric Indicators
   Extracted From Scholarly Social Network Activities: Dimensions and
   Structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact
   factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or
   quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using
   scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with
   colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient,
   immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric
   indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional
   nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized
   way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the
   correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different
   samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research
   done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics.
   Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that
   altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which
   altmetric indicators interact with each other.
   Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from
   scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most
   robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we
   downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of
   metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application
   programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among
   altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we
   visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated
   colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram
   to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation
   structure, we used a social network map to represent the social
   relationships and the strength of relations.
   Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is
   significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of
   downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that
   the Spearman coefficients from 91.58\% of the pairs of variables
   indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS
   map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional
   metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network
   diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to
   other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and
   traditional metric indicators.
   Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly
   with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the
   social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional
   metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer
   phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact
   transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and
   accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional
   metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the
   impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence,
   altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing
   scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social
   structure.}},

   significantly different for two article types: ``New finding{''} and
   ``Changes clinical practice{''}: FFa scores value the appropriateness of
   medical research for clinical practice and ``New finding{''} articles

Abstract = {{In this paper we review the so-called altmetrics or alternative metrics.
   This concept raises from the development of new indicators based on Web
   2.0, for the evaluation of the research and academic activity. The basic
   assumption is that variables such as mentions in blogs, number of twits
   or of researchers bookmarking a research paper for instance, may be
   legitimate indicators for measuring the use and impact of scientific
   publications. In this sense, these indicators are currently the focus of
   the bibliometric community and are being discussed and debated. We
   describe the main platforms and indicators and we analyze as a sample
   the Spanish research output in Communication Studies. Comparing
   traditional indicators such as citations with these new indicators. The
   results show that the most cited papers are also the ones with a highest
   impact according to the altmetrics. We conclude pointing out the main
   shortcomings these metrics present and the role they may play when
   measuring the research impact through 2.0 platforms.}},

Abstract = {{We used existing and customized bibliometric and scientometric methods
   to analyze publication trends in neuroimaging research of minimally

   contributors. We also provided a content analysis of clinical and
   ethical themes within the relevant literature. We found a 27\% growth in
   the number of papers over the period of study, professional diversity
   among a wide range of peripheral author contributors but only few
   authors who dominate the field, and few new technical paradigms and
   clinical themes that would fundamentally expand the landscape. The

Title = {{The value and use of social media as communication tool in the plant
   sciences}},
Journal = {{PLANT METHODS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{Social media now complements many parts of our lives. Facebook, Twitter,
   YouTube and many other social networking sites allow users to share and
   interact with online content and to connect with like-minded people. Its
   strengths - rapid dissemination and amplification of content and the
   ability to lead informal conversations - make it a powerful tool to use
   in a professional context. This commentary explains the overall concept
   of social media and offers suggestions on usage and possible types of
   scientific content. It advises researchers on the potential benefits and
   how to take a strategic approach towards building a social media
   presence. It also presents examples of effective social media use within
   the plant science community. Common reasons for scientists to not engage
   with social media include the fear of appearing unprofessional, posting
   something wrong or being misunderstood, or a lack of confidence in their
   computer skills. With the rapid changes in academic publishing,
   dissemination and science communication, as well as the rise of
   `altmetrics' to track online engagement with scientific content, digital
   literacy will become an essential skill in a scientist's tool kit.}},

Title = {{Do Altmetrics Work? Twitter and Ten Other Social Web Services}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly
   advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness.
   Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that
   altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few
   case studies have reported medium correlations between specific
   altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill
   this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science
   citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric
   mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also
   introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different
   citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were
   found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles
   with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence
   (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream
   media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was
   insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and
   Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero
   altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics
   and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric
   values for articles published at different times, even within the same
   year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and
   scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using
   altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics
   except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are
   prevalent enough to be useful in practice.}},

   trends realtimely. By monitoring the downloads of scientific articles in
   the journal of Scientometrics for 744 h, namely one month, we
   investigate the download statistics. Then we aggregate the keywords in
   these downloaded research papers, and analyze the trends of article
   downloading and keyword downloading. Furthermore, taking both the
   downloads of keywords and articles into consideration, we design a
   method to detect the emerging research trends. We find that in
   scientometrics field, social media, new indices to quantify scientific
   productivity (g-index), webometrics, semantic, text mining, and open
   access are emerging fields that scientometrics researchers are focusing
   on.}},
