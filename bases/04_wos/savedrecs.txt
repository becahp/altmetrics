AB Purpose The influencing factors of academic papers have always been the focus of attention in the field of Scientometrics. Exploring the influencing factors of altmetrics indicators and traditional literature indicators on academic papers is beneficial to better explore the potential significance and value of academic papers in the evaluation of scientific research. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Based on the latest JCR citation report, this paper selects 22 academic journals in the JIF Quartile Q1 journal of Information Science and Library Science, and then obtains the evaluation data of these journal papers from WOS database and Altmetric.com. This paper uses literature measurement, correlation analysis and regression analysis to explore the influencing factors of the paper. Findings The results show that the original influencing factors of academic papers have a significant impact on secondary influencing factors. What is more obvious is that the number of references (nr) presents a significant positive correlation with the total number of times (Z9), the number of uses (U1) and (U2). Originality/value This paper combines traditional literature indicators with Altmetrics indicators to study the influencing factors through primary influencing factors and secondary influencing factors. Through research, it denies the phenomenon that academic circles have published academic papers in the world in recent years to overemphasize certain factors to improve the influence of the paper.

DT Article; Early Access
ID TWITTER
AB Background The influence of research has long been studied using citations and impact factors (IFs). Electronic media is changing how people interact with the scientific literature. There are few investigations into these trends. Purpose To explore whether Altmetrics correlate with traditional bibliometrics in the Implantology literature. Materials and Methods Five Implantology journals with the highest IF and the 10 most highly-cited articles within those journals from 2013 to 2016 were reviewed. Altmetric score, citation count, and media "mentions" were recorded. Comparisons were conducted between Altmetric score, citations, and IF by performing Pearson correlation coefficients and descriptive statistics. Twitter accounts were studied and compared to other metrics. Results Analysis revealed no correlation between citations and Altmetrics (r = .096,P = .506) or IF and Altmetrics (r = .111,P = .443) in 2013. Altmetrics were also not significantly correlated with citations (r = 0.148,P = .305) or IF (r = .145,P = .315) in 2016. Total Altmetric scores were nine times higher in 2016 compared to 2013, with news outlets and Twitter seeing large increases in mentions. Twitter was the top medium receiving mentions across the two cohorts. Conclusions Compared to other fields, Implantology articles received lower Altmetric scores, noting an area of improvement. Altmetrics at this time are insufficient to replace traditional bibliometrics, but may provide helpful real-time information concerning article dissemination.

AB Background. Altmetrics analyze the visibility of articles in social media and estimate their impact on the general population. We performed an altmetric analysis of articles on central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating disease (CIDD) and investigated its correlation with citation analysis. Methods. Articles in the 91 journals comprising the "clinical neurology," "neuroscience," and "medicine, general, and internal" Web of Science categories were searched for their relevance to the CIDD topic. The Altmetric Explorer database was used to determine the Altmetric.com Attention Score (AAS) values of the selected articles. The papers with the top 100 AAS values were characterized. Results. Articles most frequently mentioned online were primarily published after 2014 and were published in journals with high impact factors. All articles except one were dealt with the issue of multiple sclerosis. Most were original articles, but editorials were also common. Novel treatments and risk factors are the most frequent topics. The AAS was weakly correlated with journal impact factors; however, no link was found between the AAS and the number of citations. Conclusions. We present the top 100 most frequently mentioned CIDD articles in online media using an altmetric approach. Altmetrics can rapidly offer alternative information on the impact of research based on a broader audience and can complement traditional metrics.

TI Examining the Correlation Between Altmetric Score and Citations in the

SO UROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPACT
AB OBJECTIVE To determine if article Altmetric scores correlate with journal impact factor and citation count in the urologic literature.
   METHODS We identified the top 10 most-cited articles for the 15 urology journals with the highest impact factor in 2013 and 2016. Citation count and Altmetric scores were recorded for each of the articles. The journal impact factor and date of Twitter account development were recorded for each of the journals. The variables were analyzed in Microsoft excel using Pearson's correlation testing.
   RESULTS A total of 300 articles were analyzed. In 2013, Altmetric scores and citation number showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.164, P = .045), although Altmetric scores did not correlate with journal impact factor (r = 0.005, P = .957). In 2016, there was significant positive correlation between Altmetric scores and citation number (r = 0.268, P = .0009), as well as between Altmetric scores and journal impact factor (r = 0.201, P = .014). The total citation count decreased from 15,235 in 2013 to 8622 in 2016 while the total Altmetric score increased from 1135 in 2013 to 2563 in 2016. Older Twitter accounts were not associated with increasing correlations between Altmetric score and bibliometrics in either 2013 (r = 0.221, P = .54) or 2016 (r = 0.083, P = .819).
   CONCLUSION At this point in time, Altmetric score is only weakly correlated with citation counts in the urology literature. Altmetrics and traditional bibliometrics should be viewed as complements to one another rather than surrogates when determining research dissemination and impact. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide insights on the improvement of academic impact and social attention of Chinese collaboration articles from the perspective of altmetrics. Design/methodology/approach The authors retrieved articles which are from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and indexed by Nature Index as sampled articles. With the methods of distribution analysis, comparative analysis and correlation analysis, authors compare the coverage differences of altmetric sources for CAS Chinese articles and CAS international articles, and analyze the correlation between the collaborative information and the altmetric indicators. Findings Results show that the coverage of altmetric sources for CAS international articles is greater than that for CAS Chinese articles. Mendeley and Twitter cover a higher percentage of collaborative articles than other sources studied. Collaborative information, such as number of collaborating countries, number of collaborating institutions, and number of collaborating authors, show moderate or low correlation with altmetric indicator counts. Mendeley readership has a moderate correlation with altmetric indicators like tweets, news outlets and blog posts. Practical implications - International scientific collaboration at different levels improves attention, academic impact and social impact of articles. International collaboration and altmetrics indicators supplement each other. The results of this study can help us better understand the relationship between altmetrics indicators of articles and collaborative information of articles. It is of great significance to evaluate the influence of Chinese articles, as well as help to improve the academic impact and social attention of Chinese collaboration articles. Originality/value To the best of authors' knowledge, few studies focus on the use of altmetrics to assess publications produced through Chinese academic collaboration. This study is one of a few attempts that include the number of collaborating countries, number of collaborating institutions, and number of collaborating authors of scientific collaboration into the discussion of altmetric indicators and figured out the relationship among them.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the presence of highly cited papers of Nature in social media websites and tools. It also tries to examine the correlation between altmetric and bibliometric indicators. Design/methodology/approach This descriptive study was carried out using altmetric indicators. The research sample consisted of 1,000 most-cited articles in Nature. In February 2019, the bibliographic information of these articles was extracted from the Scopus database. Then, the titles of all articles were manually searched on Google, and by referring to the article in the journal website and altmetric institution, the data related to social media presence and altmetric score of articles were collected. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS. Findings According to the results of the study, from 1,000 articles, 989 of them (98.9 per cent) were mentioned at least once in different social media websites and tools. The most used altmetric source in highly cited articles was Mendeley (98.9 per cent), followed by Citeulike (79.8 per cent) and Wikipedia (69.4 per cent). Most Tweets, blog posts, Facebook posts, news stories, readers in Mendeley, Citeulike and Connotea and Wikipedia citations belonged to the article titled "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search". The highest altmetric score was 3,135 which belonged to this paper. Most tweeters and articles' readers were from the USA. The membership type of the tweeters was public membership. In terms of fields of study, most readers were PhD students in Agricultural and Biological Sciences. Finally, the results of Spearman's Correlation revealed positive significant statistical correlation between all altmetric indicators and received citations of highly cited articles (p-value = 0.0001). Practical implications - The results of this study can help researchers, editors and editorial boards of journals better understand the importance and benefits of using social media and tools to publish articles. Originality/value Altmetrics is a relatively new field, and in particular, there are not many studies related to the presence of articles in various social media until now. Accordingly, in this study, a comprehensive altmetric analysis was carried out on 1000 most-cited articles of one of the world's most reliable journals.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the similarities and differences between the Twitter users who tweeted on journal articles in psychology and political science disciplines.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from Web of Science, Altmetric.com, and Twitter. A total of 91,826 tweets with 22,541 distinct Twitter user profiles for psychology discipline and 29,958 tweets with 10,478 distinct Twitter user profiles for political science discipline were used for analysis. The demographics analysis includes gender, geographic location, individual or organization user, academic or non-academic background, and psychology/political science domain knowledge background. A machine learning approach using support vector machine (SVM) was used for user classification based on the Twitter user profile information. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling was used to discover the topics that the users discussed from the tweets.
   Findings - Results showed that the demographics of Twitter users who tweeted on psychology and political science are significantly different. Tweets on journal articles in psychology reflected more the impact of scientific research finding on the general public and attracted more attention from the general public than the ones in political science. Disciplinary difference in term of user demographics exists, and thus it is important to take the discipline into consideration for future altmetrics studies.
   Originality/value - From this study, researchers or research organizations may have a better idea on who their audiences are, and hence more effective strategies can be taken by researchers or organizations to reach a wider audience and enhance their influence.

AB Tweet: #Altmetrics can shape how #leisure scholars think about sharing #research for greater public impact @LeisureSciences. Altmetrics, or "alternative metrics" measure scholarly and public engagement with scholarship through traditional metrics (e.g., citation counts) and contemporary metrics (e.g., mentions on social media and news outlets in real time). Since their emergence in 2010, they now play a role in the tenure process and factor into how scholars write articles and engage with social media to increase public consumption of their research (bridging the public/ivory tower/practitioner divide). In this research note, we describe altmetrics and answer some questions surrounding them. Questions we explore include: What are altmetrics? How are they calculated? What are the benefits of measuring scholarship in this way? What tensions exist in measuring scholarship in this way? How can leisure scholars engage with altmetrics? And why should leisure scholars/studies care about altmetrics?

AB AimTo analyse and visualize the knowledge structure of scientific articles in the field of Endodontology with high altmetric attention scores to discover hot topics, active researchers and the journals involved.
   MethodologyOn 5 June 2019, the altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK) was searched using the titles of 11 endodontic journals. Bibliometric data from endodontic articles and journals with an altmetric score >5 (top 5%) were retrieved from PubMed and analysed using the VOSviewer. Science mapping of articles with an altmetric score >5 at two levels was created: author keywords co-occurrence and co-authorship network analysis.
   ResultsOf the 2197 articles in the field of Endodontology identified with altmetrics, 192 had altmetric scores >5 (top 5%). Considering the total mentions amongst all altmetric resources, the Journal of Endodontics had the highest rank followed by the International Endodontic Journal and Australian Endodontic Journal. Twitter was the most popular altmetric data resource followed by patents and Facebook. Meta-analysis, systematic review and pulpitis were the hot topics. At the author level, Dummer P.M.H had the greatest influence on the network. There was no significant correlation between altmetric score and citations count (P > 0.05). Mendeley mentions correlated with citations (P < 0.05).
   ConclusionsOverall, the altmetric scores of topics within Endodontology were low, possibly due to the specific and specialized nature of the specialty, as well as the difficulty members of the public probably have in understanding endodontic research. Journals and researchers with a focus on Endodontology would have more influence if they were to set-up their own social media profiles and thus enhance their visibility and social impact by immediately sharing research findings and communicating with their network and audience.

AB The scientific literature on altmetrics published from 2005 to 2018 was analysed. The overall structure of the speciality's intellectual landscape is depicted through clusters of co-cited references, analysing journal and author co-citations. The 56,936 references cited in the 8,145 papers of all kinds retrieved from the Dimensions bibliographic database were included in the initial dataset used in the analysis. Pathfinder networks were generated with CiteSpace to determine the most prevalent journals and authors in the speciality. Conceptual structures were identified by co-citation clustering and latent semantic analysis. 'Open knowledge', 'altmetric collection', 'web indicator', 'assessing research', 'ResearchGate score', 'open data citation advantage', 'Google Scholar author citation', 'share data', 'academic tweet', 'Mendeley readership count' and 'social media metrics' were observed to be the lines of research presently favoured by specialists. Statistical indicators were calculated to determine the journals and contributors making the greatest impact.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to analyse the literature production on application of bibliometrics in nursing research.
   Methods: Historical, descriptive, and exploratory bibliometrics analyses were used. The papers were harvested from the Scopus bibliographical database (Elsevier, Maribor, Netherlands), on November 18th, 2018, using the search string bibliometric* in publication titles, abstracts, and keywords, limited to the subject of nursing, for the period 1970 to 2018.
   Findings: The search resulted in 531 publications with 18 publications removed after manual inspection of publications abstracts. The literature production trend was positive. The nursing specific historical roots appeared only recently. The United States of America and Spain were the most productive countries, and most papers were published in Nutricion Hospitalaria and the Journal of Advanced Nursing. Descriptive analysis, research evaluation, content analysis, citation analyses, and trend analysis in nursing research were the most prolific themes.
   Conclusions: Applications of bibliometric in nursing is comparable to bibliometrics use in general, however there are some gaps including the use of altmetrics and of Big Data analysis.

AB Background: The impact of a scientific article has traditionally been measured by the impact factor (IF) of the journal it is published in and the number of times it is cited. However, citations have a lag period before the true impact of an article can be determined. The Altmetric score has emerged as a measure of the digital dissemination of a scientific article across multiple platforms, including Tweets, Facebook likes, and other social and popular media mentions. We hypothesized that Altmetric score would correlate with citations and journal IF in pediatric surgery.
   Methods: Using the previously identified 14 core journals of pediatric surgery, the top ten most-cited articles from each of these journals were identified for the year 2012, allowing for 5+ y of follow-up. For each article, we determined the number of times cited and the Altmetric score. For each journal, the 2012 IF and year in which the journal's Twitter account was established were determined. Bibliometric data were collected for the year 2015 to allow comparison of Altmetric scores across years. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation coefficients were determined using the GraphPad PRISM software.
   Results: Citation information for n = 140 articles from 2012 to 2015 was obtained. In 2012, articles were cited 56,159 times (median 192, range 21-5029), and the median Altmetric score was 8 (range 0-4261). Citations correlated strongly with journal IF (r = 0.82, P < 0.0001). Altmetric scores in 2012 showed weak positive correlation with citations (r = 0.1895, P = 0.0125) but did not correlate with IF (r = 0.0841, P = 0.1617). Altmetric scores in 2015 also showed weak positive correlation with citations (r = 0.238, P = 0.0023) but additionally weakly correlated with IF (r = 0.2027, P = 0.0082). Increasing age of a journal's Twitter account resulted in increasing correlation between Altmetric score and citations in both 2012 (r = 0.299, P = 0.169) and 2015 (r = 0.512, P = 0.037). Twitter was the primary social media contributor to Altmetric score in 2012 and 2015, with decreasing contribution from Facebook.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to link traditional bibliometric measures with newer measures of digital dissemination for publications in pediatric surgery. Although the Altmetric score of the top cited articles did not correlate with journal IF, it did weakly correlate with citations. Interestingly, this correlation was strongest for journals with wellestablished Twitter accounts, indicating that, over time, the Altmetric score may emerge as a tool to predict future citations. Currently, Altmetric and traditional bibliometric measures appear to have distinct but complementary roles in measuring dissemination and impact of scientific articles in pediatric surgery.

AB Scientific journals have changed the mechanisms they use for distribution and dissemination of information. Different approaches towards determining impact have emerged and among these, metrics derived from activity on social media are an emerging trend. This article aims to assess whether a correlation exists between the traditional impact factor and activity on social media. We assessed journals categorized within the area of "immunology" on the SCImago Journal and Country Rank website. Variables reflecting traditional and alternative measures of impact were collected. Differences between journals with and without social networks were assessed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests. Correlation was assessed through Spearman tests. 156 journals were analyzed, 17% had at least one social network. 48.2% of journals with social networks were classified within SJR's quartile 1. An almost perfect correlation was found between the SJR and the number of followers on Twitter, this correlation remained statistically significant after adjusting for time since creation of the account [Spearman's correlation (r(s)) = 0.83]. We propose the use of Twitter as a mechanism for dissemination of information by immunology journals, as well as other social networks for their potential to increase their audience, as well as the dissemination and impact of their publications.

AB Aim In the present study, we aimed to identify and analyze the characteristics of highly cited articles in dentistry. Methods All articles belonging to Web of Science category of "dentistry, oral surgery and medicine" published until 2016 were analyzed. The bibliometric data of the highly cited articles were evaluated. The Y-index was applied to assess authors' publication potential. Altmetric scores were recorded from Dimensions, a free online database. Results There were 3666 highly cited dentistry articles published in dental journals. Half of them were published in seven leading journals in their specialties. The major contributing countries were the USA, Sweden, the UK, and Switzerland. The highly cited articles were written by 3.7 authors on average. Jan Lindhe had the largest number of highly cited articles, whereas David H. Pashley had the highest potential to publish highly cited articles in dentistry. Conclusions Highly cited articles were distributed among various dental specialties, and the most productive periods were the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The Y-index gave dimensional details of the prolific authors. The current analysis was based on data extracted from Web of Science. Results could be different if data were extracted from other databases, such as Google Scholar.

AB July 1, 2019, JAMA Internal Medicine released online an article authored by Kitahara et al entitled "Association of radioactive iodine treatment with cancer mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism." The Altmetric Attention Score, a global indicator of interest from lay public and colleagues, skyrocketed to 223 by July 7, placing the article in the top 5% of all scored reports. The overall perception of death from cancer risk associated with I-131 is inflated and not supported by evidence. As co-authors of this article, we offer previously unpublished data and analysis that (1) disputes clinical significance of the associated risk from I-131 and (2) shows, again, that antithyroid drugs carry a statistically significant and a much more obvious cancer death risk.

The criteria from the infometry and bibliometry as well as some attmetrics indicators are assumed as the basis, the fundamental methods being modeling, systems approach and functional analysis. In this sense, the objective of the article is to present a proposal of indexation strategy in multidisciplinary journals. A design is used in Microsoft Visio that materializes the modeling of the indexation strategy of the multidisciplinary journal in four stages, which constitutes the main result of the study. The Metropolitan Journal of Applied Sciences developed the first and second stage obtaining the Indexation in DOAJ, MIAR, Google Scholar and other bases of interest.

AB The use of online video by universities to communicate with their community is increasingly growing, however, the effect of the university characteristics on the online video impact remains overwhelmingly unstudied. Previous research has found a relation between research performance and the online video impact of the most prestigious universities (world-class universities). The objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, we aim to check whether this relation can be generalised by means of a correlation analysis. Secondly, a model is introduced to explain how research performance affects online video impact and is empirically tested using the PLS-SEM technique. Results show that the positive relation between research performance and online video impact is restricted to the most prestigious universities. Among these, research performance shows a significant effect on online video impact, with the online video orientation of the university playing a positive moderating effect. Limitations are discussed and suggestions for further research are proposed.

AB Mendeley is a social network that allows researchers worldwide to discover, search and share resources and to cooperate with peer researchers. We can recognize a large amount of exhaustive information about who reads research articles and the contexts in which research articles are read by using data about people who register in Mendeley as readers of articles. The purpose of this paper is to explore different types of users of international Egyptian academic articles indexed in Scopus across four major fields: health sciences, life sciences, physical sciences and social sciences inside and outside academia. The aim is to determine the impact and use of international Egyptian academic articles in Mendeley compared to their citation impact and to explore whether there is any correlation between Mendeley readership counts and the citation indicators for these publications. Furthermore, this study analyses readers' categories and discovers their country locations according to the data retrieved from Mendeley profiles. The data for this study are collected from the Scopus database. Webometric Analyst 2.0 is used to retrieve Mendeley readership statistics for all collected articles. This information will help in understanding how and to what extent Mendeley readership metrics are applicable in assessing the publications of Egyptian authors and in understanding the usage versus citation pattern and impact of Egyptian scientific outputs on global society. The results indicate that the majority of readers in all disciplines are Ph.D. students, master's students, and post-graduate students; however, other types of academics are also represented. The findings also indicate that the highest correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts are found for the types of users who frequently author academic papers, except for professors in some sub-disciplines. Regarding country locations, Egyptian international publications are mostly used by users from more than 100 countries worldwide. However, the majority in every field are from the USA. Overall, this study concludes that Egyptian researchers have great international influence on global society. The study suggests that Mendeley readership may reflect usage similarly to conventional citation impacts if the data are limited to readers who are also authors, without the delay of influence measured by citation indicators. Meanwhile, Mendeley data can disclose the invisible impact of research publications, such as educational value for non-author users inside academia or the impact of research papers on practice for users outside academia. Finally, Mendeley readership statistics can reflect the distribution of users in various countries and potential readers worldwide, identify the invisible impact of the research output per country on global society, and be used as a complementary and informative tool for citation databases in explicating the influence of scientific outputs.

AB Cross-national distance among countries has been of central interest in International Business and Management research. Therefore, different efforts have been made to develop models/measurements to address this issue. In this article we identify the models/measurements of cross-national distance developed since the beginning of the 2000 decade. After briefly presenting each model's distinctive features, we assess their impact on the research field based on a wide range of bibliometric techniques (direct, indirect, and adjusted citation impacts, altmetrics, academic reviews, journals and publishers' prestige). Our analysis shows that the narrower cultural distance construct has lost ground to the wider psychic distance one. Furthermore, researchers highly value those models and measurement that go beyond the cultural and psychic distance constructs providing a multidimensional framework to analyze and measure cross-national distance among countries. Our analysis of these models' impact shows that this a salient issue in the research field as a whole and a central topic in the highest ranked journals in International Business and Management.

AB This paper reports on book impact assessment using bibliometrics, usage metrics and altmetrics. The objective of the study is to investigate the citation, usage, reach and readership of scholarly books published by Springer Nature during a three-year time-span after their publication using citations, downloads, social media mentions and online reference manager bookmarks data. The study population was limited to those Springer books published in 2014, covering four broad disciplines (pure sciences, social sciences, engineering and medicine) to study disciplinary differences. The 3 years' span was chosen to make sure all books had enough time to attract citations, downloads, attentions and bookmarks. Data on 1116 randomly-selected books were obtained in July 2018 and they contained the total number of times each book was cited in CrossRef.com, downloaded in Link.Springer.com, mentioned in altmetric.com, and bookmarked in Mendeley.com over a three-year time window from January 1, 2015 to December 30, 2017. Although books are the preferred publication format especially in arts, humanities and social sciences, the results of book assessment based on the citation, usage, social media metrics from social science discipline was not apparent. This is evident as books in pure sciences were more frequently cited, books in medicine received more social media attentions and engineering books had the highest download counts and Mendeley bookmarks. The results also demonstrated that Crossref citations and SpringerLink downloads correlated significantly in all four disciplines indicating books with more download statistics also accumulated higher citation counts. The study is significant to provide evidence that alternative sources such as usage-based and social media-based metrics could act as complement to traditional citation-based measures for assessing the impact of books and/or book chapters in a multidimensional way.

AB Background Traditional metrics have been extensively used to evaluate the scientific performance. Despite being widespread accepted, citation-based metrics are not able to describe the social impact of research. A diverse metric, Altmetric, was proposed to overcome those limitations. Aim This study aims to analyse the social impact of research in the field of paediatric dentistry and to assess if a correlation exists between the JCR citations, the AAS score, and the recently released Dimensions citation count. Design A bibliometric study was conducted on the four journals related to Paediatric Dentistry listed in the JCR from 2014 to 2017. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the articles and the journals. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship among JCR citations, AAS, and Dimensions. Results The percentage of articles with an AAS presents a huge variability and was significantly higher in the International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry. In our sample, the correlation between the JCR citation count and the AAS was poor in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 and low in 2017. The correlation between JCR citation and Dimensions citation count was strong. Conclusions The social impact of research in paediatric dentistry can be increased. Dimensions could be an alternative to the JCR. Both the editors and the researcher should change their vision and facilitate the access to research information to scholar and non-scholar audiences.

AB Scholarly articles are now increasingly being mentioned and discussed in social media platforms, sometimes even as pre- or post-print version uploads. Measures of social media mentions and coverage are now emerging as an alternative indicator of impact of scholarly articles. This article aims to explore how much scholarly research output from India is covered in different social media platforms, and how similar or different it is from the world average. It also analyses the discipline-wise variations in coverage and altmetric attention for Indian research output, including a comparison with the world average. Results obtained show interesting patterns. Only 28.5% of the total research output from India is covered in social media platforms, which is about 18% less than the world average. ResearchGate and Mendeley are the most popular social media platforms in India for scholarly article coverage. In terms of discipline-wise variation, medical sciences and biological sciences have relatively higher coverage across different platforms compared to disciplines like information science and engineering.

AB Altmetrics are a relatively new phenomenon in research. These metrics measure the attention that research articles receive from nontraditional venues such as social media and the Internet. This study examined how these metrics affect both the readership and citation of articles in communication research. The study examined citation data alongside altmetrics data from academic social networking sites ResearchGate and Mendeley, as well as mentions on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Results indicated that all altmetrics positively correlated with citation. Posting articles on sites such as ResearchGate and Mendeley not only impacted readership, it increased the likelihood of citation. Other variables that improved readership and citation were social media mentions, downloadable articles, coauthorship, and an active online presence among scholars.

AB In the modern age of connected world and social media, research outcomes that are of direct interest & relevance to society are increasingly being shared and disseminated in news sources and social media platforms. Some studies have found that social media mentions of research papers can be an early indicator of their impact. India, which is now among the top 10 knowledge producers in the world, has more than 900 Universities that contribute to its research output. This paper tries to analyze as to what proportion of research output from the 100 most productive Indian institutions gets social media coverage. It is found that, while average social media coverage for India is around 28.5%, the coverage varies between 5% to 60% for different institutions. It is also observed that research output from institutions in some specific disciplines (such as Medical Science and Biological Science) attract more social media coverage as compared to others. The possible impact of geographical location (in a metro city) of an institution on social media coverage of its research output is analyzed as well. The findings present useful insight about social media coverage of research output of Indian institutions, which may be a proxy for societal relevance of the research work, and also indicate that suitable mechanisms need to be designed to promote dissemination of research results from Indian institutions in popular social media platforms.

AB YouTube has become the standard social network for the dissemination of university multimedia content, but the impact of academic online videos has been scarcely researched. This study covers this gap and provides a new dimension to evaluate university performance. Data and statistics of 416 YouTube accounts and ca. 190,000 online videos of world class universities are gathered. The H-index is adapted to quantify the online video impact, universities are ranked accordingly and the correlates of impact are analyzed. The H-based ranking of online video impact is closely related to standard rankings of world class universities, with a stronger relation than that with other online video related metrics. Research productivity and online video orientation of a university are robustly related to online video impact, whereas teaching, university size and geographical location are not.

AB Objectives Altmetrics, or alternative metrics, have recently emerged as a web-based metrics measuring the impact of research with an emphasis on the public engagement with the research output. In this study, we aimed to identify and analyze research articles about oral cancer that provoked the most online attention. Methods Altmetric Explorer was used to identify articles about oral cancer that generated the highest online attention. Descriptive and correlational statistics were performed, and the top 100 articles were identified and analyzed. Results A total of 7,940 articles were identified. Topics were mostly discussed on Facebook, Twitter, Mendeley, and news outlets. The top 100 articles that generated the highest online attention discussed mainly topics related to treatment outcomes and quality of life. Human papilloma virus (HPV) was the most commonly discussed individual topic in the list of top 100 outputs (n = 20). Most articles originated from the USA (n = 46) and Europe (n = 33; mainly from UK [24 articles]). Articles were published in 47 journals that belong to different specialities; journals with a social media account had significantly higher Altmetric scores for their articles compared to those without an account. Conclusion Topics of general interest to the public such as HPV transmission and vaccination, risk factors, and treatment generated the highest online attention.

AB In recent years, alternative forms of impact measurement, known as "altmetrics", have been proposed as a potential supplement to the more traditional citation-based metric system in determining the influence of orthopaedic literature on the community. As social media grows increasingly more pervasive into mainstream society, so too does its presence in the health care field, especially in the realm of orthopaedics; therefore, it is necessary to determine the influence social media has both on orthopaedic care and the dissemination of orthopaedic literature to the academic community.

AB This paper aims to analyses the altmetric performance of Brazilian publications authored by researchers who are holders of productivity scholarship (PQ) of the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). The scope of this research assesses the PQs in activity on October, 2017 (n = 14.609). The collection of scientific production registered on Lattes was conducted via GetLattesData and filtered by articles from academic journals published between 2016 and October 2017 that hold the Digital Object Identifier (n = 99064). The online attention data are analyzed according to their distribution by density and variation; language of the publication and field of knowledge; and by average performance of the type of source that has provided its altmetric values. The result show long tail behavior of the altmetric score, with most part of the articles with no online attention, while few articles have a high index. The average of the online attention indicates a better performance of articles written in English and belonging to the Health and Biological Sciences field of knowledge. As for the sources, there was a good performance from Mendeley followed by Twitter.

AB OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to analyze the publication output of postgraduate pediatric neurosurgery fellows for a 10-year period as well as identify 25 individual highly productive pediatric neurosurgeons. The correlation between academic productivity and the site of fellowship training was studied.
   METHODS Programs certified by the Accreditation Council for Pediatric Neurosurgery Fellowships that had 5 or more graduating fellows from 2006 to 2015 were included for analysis. Fellows were queried using Scopus for publications during those 10 years with citation data through 2017. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated, comparing program rankings of faculty against fellows using the revised Hirsch index (r-index; primary) and Hirsch index (h-index; secondary). A list of 25 highly accomplished individual academicians and their fellowship training locations was compiled.
   RESULTS Sixteen programs qualified with 152 fellows from 2006 to 2015; 136 of these surgeons published a total of 2009 articles with 23,735 citations. Most publications were pediatric-specific (66.7%) clinical articles (93.1%), with middle authorship (55%). Co-investigators were more likely from residency than fellowship. There was a clustering of the top 7 programs each having total publications of around 120 or greater, publications per fellow greater than 12, more than 1200 citations, and adjusted ir10 (revised 10-year institutional h-index) and ih10 (10-year institutional h-index) values of approximately 2 or higher. Correlating faculty and fellowship program rankings yielded correlation coefficients ranging from 0.53 to 0.80. Fifteen individuals (60%) in the top 25 (by r5 index) list completed their fellowship at 1 of these 7 institutions.
   CONCLUSIONS Approximately 90% of fellowship-trained pediatric neurosurgeons have 1 or more publications, but the spectrum of output is broad. There is a strong correlation between where surgeons complete their fellowships and postgraduate publications.

AB This paper makes an evaluation and comparison of influence on international Open Access (OA) between China and USA. First, Chinese and American OA journals are taken as an example. Second, combining traditional citation indicators with altmetrics indicators, a process of influence evaluation and comparison model on Chinese and American OA journals is constructed. Third, an evaluation indicator system of OA journals from two dimensions of academic influence and societal influence is constructed too. Lastly, through normalization, correlation analysis, reliability analysis, validity analysis, factor analysis and two-dimensional analysis, the academic and societal influence of OA journals are evaluated and compared between China and USA. It is found that in terms of academic influence and societal influence, the evaluation scores of international OA journals are quite different between China and USA. The influence of the USA is far greater than that of China. The results show a strong positive correlation among the 7 traditional citation indicators based on JCR, and a high positive correlation among the 8 altmetrics indicators based on Altmetrics Explorer, and the indicators have a significant consistency both overall and internal. There is a highly positive correlation between academic influence and societal influence scores for the Chinese and American OA journals. Overall, the results confirm that the evaluation of societal influence of OA journals is used as supplement to the evaluation of academic influence. Altmetrics is also a powerful tool to measure the societal influence of OA journals, but it cannot replace the traditional citation indicators at present.

There are in total eight indicators out of three categories including Captures, Citations, and Usage analysed in the study. The results of this study shows that Captures and Usage indicators measure very different aspects of research impact, although both of them show some similarity from the perspective of citations. The Characteristic Scores and Scales method was applied to different types of altmetric indicators for the first time and its robustness of the method was proved again.

AB Universities are increasingly offering support services for bibliometrics, often based in the library. This paper describes work done to produce a competency model for those supporting bibliometrics. The results of a questionnaire in which current practitioners rated bibliometric tasks as entry level, core or specialist are reported. Entry level competencies identified were explaining bibliometric concepts, doing basic calculations and some professional skills. Activities identified by participants as core are outlined. Reflecting on items that were considered in scope but specialist there was less stress on evaluating scholars, work at a strategic level, working with data outside proprietary bibliometric tools and consultancy-type services as opposed to training for disintermediated use. A competency model is presented as an appendix.

AB Mendeley reader counts are a good source of early impact evidence for the life and natural sciences articles because they are abundant, appear before citations, and correlate moderately or strongly with citations in the long term. Early studies have found less promising results for the humanities and this article assesses whether the situation has now changed. Using Mendeley reader counts for articles in 12 arts and humanities Scopus subcategories, the results show that Mendeley reader counts reflect Scopus citation counts in most arts and humanities as strongly as in other areas of scholarship. Thus, Mendeley can be used as an early citation impact indicator in the arts and humanities, although it is unclear whether reader or citation counts reflect the underlying value of arts and humanities research.

Results show that ResearchGate is the venue of choice, although respondents do not believe maintaining a profile on academic social media platforms influences academic careers. Respondents do see the value of academic social media sites to enhance visibility and reputation. These data are complemented with an analysis of the visibility on academic/professional social media platforms of this group. The altmetric indicators derived from the data were compared to traditional bibliometric indicators.

AB Purpose Since the development of web 2.0, there has been a paradigm shift in methods of knowledge sharing. This has equally impacted on techniques of research evaluation. Many scholars have argued that the social utilization of research is hardly reflected in the traditional methods of research evaluation. The purpose of this paper is to determine the research impact of Library and Information Science (LIS) journals using Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and Google Scholar (GS) and then examine whether there is a correlation between their citations and altmetric attentions. Design/methodology/approach This paper is an attempt to contribute to this discussion with focus on the field of LIS. This paper adopted descriptive informatics to analyze LIS journals. The paper extracted citation data from WoS, Scopus and GS, and altmetric attentions from 85 LIS journals indexed by WoS. Further, 18 journals with high altmetric attention were identified, while 9 of these maintained consistent presence in the three databases used. Findings Findings show that of these databases, citation data from GS was found to have a high correlation with altmetric attention, while the other two databases maintained moderate correlations with altmetric attention. The paper also found a positive but non-significant correlation between citation scores and altmetric attention in the nine journals that maintained consistent presence in the three databases. Practical implications - The findings of this paper will be useful to librarians in selection of relevant journals for their libraries and also will assist authors in the choice of publication outlets for their papers particularly when considering journals that have visibility and research impact. Originality/value The originality of the paper lies on empirical evidences from the citation and altmetric data extracted from the databases used for the paper.

DE Bibliography; Javascript
AB Background. Given the vast number of standards and formats for bibliographical data, any program working with bibliographies and citations has to be able to interpret such data. This paper describes the development of Citation.js (https://citation.js.org/), a tool to parse and format according to those standards. The program follows modern guidelines for software in general and JavaScript in specific, such as version control, source code analysis, integration testing and semantic versioning.
   Results. The result is an extensible tool that has already seen adaption in a variety of sources and use cases: as part of a server-side page generator of a publishing platform, as part of a local extensible document generator, and as part of an in-browser converter of extracted references. Use cases range from transforming a list of DOIs or Wikidata identifiers into a BibTeX file on the command line, to displaying RIS references on a webpage with added Altmetric badges to generating ''How to cite this'' sections on a blog. The accuracy of conversions is currently 27% for properties and 60% for types on average and a typical initialization takes 120 ms in browsers and 1 s with Node. js on the command line.
   Conclusions. Citation. js is a library supporting various formats of bibliographic information in a broad selection of use cases and environments. Given the support for plugins, more formats can be added with relative ease.

AB How research impact is defined and evaluated is much-debated at research policy level. Offering one avenue for capturing societal research impact, altmetrics are proposed as quantitative indicators providing a measure of the reach and attention that a research output, such as a peer-eviewed paper, is receiving online. Eighty publicly-funded food researchers participated in an online mixed-methods engagement study. The analytical framework of sensemaking was used to explore participants' views of altmetrics as a threat or opportunity for their perceived professional identities. The identities important to our participants included ensuring rigour and quality in knowledge production; communicating and engaging with non-academic audiences; and bringing about tangible and meaningful changes in society. While an appetite for changes to research evaluation was apparent in our study, altmetrics was perceived to introduce a number of different threats as well as opportunities to the academic identity, which will influence its potential uptake and use.

AB Introduction Citation counts of articles have been used to measure scientific outcomes and assess suitability for grant applications. However, citation counts are not without limitations. With the rise of social media, altmetric scores may provide an alternative assessment tool.
   Objectives The aims of the study were to assess the characteristics of highly cited articles in medical professionalism and their altmetric scores.
   Methods The Web of Science was searched for top-cited articles in medical professionalism, and the characteristics of each article were identified. The altmetric database was searched to identify report for each identified article. A model to assess the relationship between the number of citations and each of the key characteristics as well as altmetric scores was developed.
   Results No correlations were found between the number of citations and number of years since publication (p=0.192), number of institutes (p=0.081), number of authors (p=0.270), females in authorship (p=0.150) or number of grants (p=0.384). The altmetric scores varied from 0 to 155, total=806, median=5.0, (IQR=20). Twitter (54%) and Mendeley (62%) were the most popular altmetric resources. No correlation was found between the number of citations and the altmetric scores (p=0.661). However, a correlation was found for articles published in 2007 and after (n=17, p=0.023). To further assess these variables, a model was developed using multivariate analysis; did not show significant differences across subgroups. The topics covered were learning and teaching professionalism, curriculum issues, professional and unprofessional behaviour.
   Conclusions Altmetric scores of articles were significantly correlated with citations counts for articles published in 2007 and after. Highly cited articles were produced mainly by the USA, Canada and the UK. The study reflects the emerging role of social media in research dissemination. Future studies should investigate the specific features of highly cited articles and factors reinforcing distribution of research data among scholars and non-scholars.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA; IMPACT FACTOR; ACCEPTANCE; TECHNOLOGY; JOURNALS
AB As the online dissemination of scholarly outputs gets faster and easier, altmetrics, social media based indices, have emerged alongside traditional metrics for research evaluation. In a two-phase survey, we investigate scholars' familiarity and usage of traditional metrics and altmetrics. In this paper, we present the second phase with 448 participants. We found few traditional metrics, like the Journal Impact Factor and number of citations, are familiar to and often used by scholars for research evaluation. Among altmetrics, only views/downloads, readers, and followers are known to more than half the respondents. Unseen benefits and lack of time are hindrances to using metrics for the evaluation of research outputs. Although social media are well-known, scholars prefer promoting their research by publishing in journals and attending conferences. We found social media usage, perceived ease of use and usefulness of altmetrics affect the usage of altmetrics. Findings suggest altmetrics have attracted attention in academia and could be considered complementary to traditional metrics. We acknowledge that due to the limited sample size, statistics and demographics in this study, findings cannot be said to be representative of the entire academic population worldwide. Future studies are needed that cover a wider range of academic disciplines around the world.

This method, originally applied to scientific literature, will be transferred to the digital environment of collective knowledge generation. To this end, a dataset containing Wikipedia references collected from Altmetric and Scopus' Journal Metrics journals has been used. The articles have been categorized according to the disciplines and specialties established in the All Science Journal Classification (ASJC). They have also been grouped by journal of publication. A set of articles in the Humanities, comprising 25555 Wikipedia articles with 41655 references to 32245 resources, has been selected. Finally, a descriptive statistical study has been conducted and co-citations have been mapped using networks and indicators of degree and betweenness centrality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Twitter altmetrics has been proposed to measure the popularity and the potential societal impact of scientific products, but scientific tweeters who produce the Twitter altmetrics data have not been well explored. The study, by analyzing 2.63 million scientific tweeters' data that are extracted from the Altmetric.com company dataset, is aimed to reveal their productivity and geographic distribution in a comprehensive way. To gain a more in-depth understanding of their account types and identities, 1468 scientific tweeters of different levels of activeness are sampled for further analysis. Our results show that: (1) The extent to which a small proportion of tweeters have posted most of scientific tweets increases over time. In 2016, 10% of scientific tweeters have posted 80% of scientific tweets; (2) Scientific tweeters are widely distributed around the world but in a different pattern with the distribution of general Twitter users. In addition, scientific tweeters are found to be more active in tweeting scientific products than retweeting them in certain areas. (3) Manual coding of the sampled tweeters shows that the percentage of bot accounts among scientific tweeters is 1.8%, which is much lower than that among general Twitter users. Moreover, 73% of scientific tweeters use Twitter for professional purpose, 76% use real names for their accounts, and 16% are institutional accounts. (4) Identities of scientific tweeters are diversified. 49% of them are researchers among which university faculty is the major type, and 38% of them are the general public. With these results we suggest number of scientific tweets is not a good indicator of measuring either popularity or impact, tweeter's productivity, location and identities must be taken into consideration in interpreting the meaning of Twitter altmetrics.

AB Objective: It is well known that social media influences politics and the economy. A new Web-based metric (Altmetrics) has recently been developed for use in scientific fields. The aim of this study was to determine which recent papers in the field of stroke have received the greatest amount of attention from the general public. The Altmetric Attention Score is an automatically calculated metric for monitoring social media.
   Patients and methods: An Altmetric Explorer search was performed on May 25, 2018 to extract the following information: (i) journal name, (ii) journal impact factor (IF), (iii) year of publication, (iv) article topic, (v) article type, and (vi) stroke subtype.
   Results: The journal that published articles that received the most attention on social media was Stroke (n = 16). Articles with higher IFs are not expected to receive greater attention on social media. Twenty-one of the identified articles related to the subtypes of ischemic stroke. Regarding contents, approximately half of the top-10 ranked articles were about modifiable risk factors, especially diet and physical activities. Two recent articles on the extension of mechanical thrombectomy after 6 h were included on this list.
   Conclusions: There are some discrepancies in perspectives between scientific articles and general social media, and the Altmetric Attention Score is considered to more dynamically reflect the interests of the general public. We therefore suggest that physicians can use Altmetric analysis to identify what the general public actually wants to know about in the real world, while they should also have a critical view of the social media that attracts the public with a stimulating theme rather than a worthy subject.

AB Academic social networking sites are important communication tools commonly used by scholars. In order to obtain an understanding of how scholars at US higher education institutions utilize these sites, this study took ResearchGate (RG) as an example and collected data from 168,059 users from 61 US higher education institutions at three research activity levels as defined by the Carnegie Classification. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted, and four clusters of institutions with different behavior patterns were observed. The results indicate that US higher education institutions play different roles based on their academic influence in the network and demonstrate distinct behaviors in overall participation, information seeking, and information sharing. Users from universities of higher academic influence exhibited a preponderance for presentation behavior and were popular in the network, while scholars at moderate research-level institutions were active in seeking behavior as well as self-improvement. However, those at lower levels were comparatively inactive. The hierarchical clustering result also suggests that user behavior on this academic social networking site reflects the academic research activity level and level of academic influence accurately and effectively. These findings show a positive correlation between levels of scholarly output and utilization of academic social networking sites. This study also contributes to the ongoing efforts in understanding the scholarly use of academic social networking sites, and to the debate on whether associated alternative metrics (altmetrics) serve as supplementary evaluation measures of scholarship in higher education. The practical implications of the study are also discussed.

AB Objective The number of articles that researchers must be familiar with is increasing, along with the importance of selective searching and summarization. This study aimed to assess and characterize the most influential articles in Helicobacter pylori research. Methods We performed a search of the top-100 cited articles using the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) and Google Scholar from their inception to 2018. The top-100 Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) articles based on online media mentions were also searched using the term H pylori. Each article was evaluated for the following characteristics: citation number, title, journal, publication year, and authorship. Results The citation number for the top-100 WoSCC articles ranged from 44 to 367. Gut published the largest number of articles (11%). In the top-100 Google Scholar articles, Lancet had the largest number of articles (13%); however, among the top-1000 cited articles published after 2012, Helicobacter published the largest number (46%). The largest number of top-100 AAS articles was published by PLOS Pathogens (6%). PubMed Central articles' citations in WoSCC or Google Scholar showed significant correlation with those from each metric; however, AAS showed no correlation. The proportion of basic research was 36%-37% in top-cited articles; but, 52% in the top-100 AAS articles. No time trend in the number of publications or citations of basic/clinical research in the top-100 bibliometrics was found. "Meta-analysis/systematic review," "gastric cancer," "eradication," and "association" were the most influential title words. Conclusion This study presents a detailed list of top-100 articles, journals, authors, and topic title words.

AB The Open Access Initiative is gaining momentum due to the worldwide availability of advanced digital tools, online publishing platforms, and systems for tracking academic contributions. Several declarations and initiatives, including Plan S, have already laid a foundation for moving away from subscription to full and immediate open-access publishing. The global initiatives imply targeting journals satisfying the upgraded quality and visibility criteria. To meet these criteria, a comprehensive approach to Open Access is recommended. This article overviews the essential components of the comprehensive approach, increasing transparency, adherence to ethical standards, and diversification of evaluation metrics. With the increasing volume of quality open-access journals, their indexing with free databases and search engines is becoming increasingly important. The Directory of Open Access Journals and PubMed Central currently free searches of open-access sources. These services, however, cannot fully satisfy the increasing demands of the users, and attempts are underway to upgrade the indexing and archiving of open-access sources in China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and elsewhere. The wide use of identifiers is essential for transparency of scholarly communications. Peer reviewers are now offered credits from Publons. These credits are transferrable to their Open Researcher and Contributor ills. Various social media channels are increasingly used by scholars to comment on articles. All these comments are tracked by related metric systems, such as Altmetrics. Combined with traditional citation evaluations, the alternative metrics can help timely identify and promote publications influencing education, research, and practice.

The similarities and differences between professional and scientific communities were considered. The concept of a professional scientific community was introduced. Local and network subtypes of scientific communities were identified. A method has been developed for obtaining the values of scientometric indicators normalized by both local and network scientific communities, the distinguishing feature of which is the use of linguistic variables and production rules of fuzzy logic. The testing of the proposed methodology was carried out based on the example of a scientometric database.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze the use of Google Scholar Citations' profiling platform by library and information science (LIS) scholars in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach Purposive sampling was used to collect Google Scholar Citations profiles between 15 November 2017 and 31 January 2018. Resultant data were analyzed in SPSS Version 21. Findings In terms of demographical data, the study results were consistent with previous studies of Pakistani LIS scholars. There were strong correlations between Google Scholar Citations metrics (publications, citations, h-index and i10-index). The results indicate that, compared with a 2011 survey of LIS academics in Pakistan, the overall uptake for this cohort remains relatively low. This cohort is not maximizing the opportunity provided by this specific online profiling system to increase research visibility. Research limitations/implications - As the study was limited to those Pakistani LIS scholars who already had a profile on ResearchGate, it would be useful to broaden the research to encompass all Pakistani LIS scholars. Practical implications - The role of the librarian as an adviser in scholarly communication and impact can be extended to support scholars in the adoption of new online platforms for scholarly communication and visibility. Originality/value There have been no published research studies on Google Scholar Citations metrics in the context of Pakistani LIS scholars as a whole.

AB The present study aims to assess highly cited articles using altmetrics and citations and identify the relationship between them. The statistical population consists of all the highly cited articles on surgery indexed on the Web of Science. The number of article citations was measured using the Web of Science and the altmetric score of the articles using the Altmetric Bookmarklet. The analysis of the data was carried out using descriptive statistics and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Of the 1077 highly cited surgery articles, 62.74 per cent had an altmetric score. The highest number of received citations was 1787, and the highest altmetric score was 2019. A positive and significant correlation was observed between the number of citations and the policy-making documents, Wikipedia citations and CiteULike (P<0.001). A positive but non-significant correlation was also observed between the number of citations and the number of Mendeley readers (r=0.02, P>0.05). A poor, negative and significant correlations were observed between the number of citations and the overall altmetric score of the highly cited surgery articles (r=-0.235, P<0.001). The findings may be due to the different pattern of using social media by the surgery researchers compared to the researchers of other fields. Altmetrics can only be used to complement citations and not replace them.

AB Recently, there has been a surge of interest in new data emerged due to the rapid development of the information technologies in scholarly communication. Since the 2010s, altmetrics has become a common trend in scientometric research. However, researchers have not treated in much detail the question of the probability distributions underlying these new data. The principal objective of this study was to investigate one of the classic problems of scientometrics-the problem of citation and readership distributions. The study is based on the data obtained from two information systems: Web of Science and Mendeley. Here we based on the concept of the cumulative empirical distribution function to explore the differences and similarities between citations and readership counts of biological journals indexed in Web of Science and Mendeley. The basic idea was to determine, for any journal, a "size" (it is said to be the topological rank) of citation and readership empirical cumulative distributions, and then to compare distributions of the topological ranks of Web of Science and Mendeley. In order to verify our model, we employ it to the bibliometric and altmetric research of 305-biological journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports 2015. The findings show that both distributions of the topological rank of biological journals are statistically close to the Wakeby distribution. The findings presented in this study add to our understanding of information processes of the scholarly communication in the new digital environment.

   domain and in social media

DT Article
DE bibliometrics; altmetrics; research outputs; scholarly communication;
   grey literature
ID ALTMETRICS; ATTENTION; TRENDS
AB Patterns and methods of scholarly communication have changed with the growth in information technology, particularly the Internet and the social web. The changes have necessitated a broader definition of scholarly communication and the role of social media in the research process. We sought to record the body of work that the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS), a research institute at the University of the Western Cape, produced over a 20-year period (1995-2015) - the first two decades of its existence - and to measure its visibility and impact using bibliometrics and altmetrics. A survey was also carried out to investigate to what extent PLAAS researchers knew and used social media in their research practice. Scopus and Google Scholar were used as citation indices and Altmetric.com provided Altmetric scores - a measure of impact through social and mainstream media. The full list of PLAAS outputs showed a composition of 54% grey literature and 46% journal articles and monographs. Given that over half of PLAAS research outputs were in the form of grey literature, and therefore not indexed in traditional bibliometric databases, we suggest that alternative metrics be used in conjunction with bibliometrics, to measure the impact of a body of work on the scholarly domain. Although the bibliometrics in this study were a useful quantitative indicator of the impact of PLAAS research, this study was inconclusive with regard to determining the impact of the research output via altmetrics, partly because not any of the grey literature, nor any author from PLAAS, had a unique identifier, thus making it difficult to track and find quantitative indicators. Nonetheless, the potential benefit for PLAAS of using altmetrics was demonstrated in selected case studies of the output of three PLAAS researchers active on social media platforms.
   Significance:
   This study demonstrates that the use of bibliometric and altmetric analyses can yield a rich picture of research output and significance, providing insight into the patterns of scholarly communication of research and policy institutions.
   The application of the research design in other research units and departments could generate results that are useful to research management within those institutions.

AB Objective: To better support dentistry researchers in the ever-changing landscape of scholarly research, academic librarians need to redefine their roles and discover new ways to be involved at each stage of the research cycle. A needs assessment survey was conducted to evaluate faculty members' research support needs and allow a more targeted approach to the development of research services in an academic health sciences library.
   Methods: The anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to full-time researchers at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto. The survey included twenty questions inquiring about researchers' needs and behaviors across three stages of the research cycle: funding and grant applications, publication and dissemination, and research impact assessment. Data were also collected on researchers' use of grey literature to identify whether current library efforts to support researchers should be improved in this area.
   Results: Among library services, researchers considered support for funding and grant applications most valuable and grey literature support least valuable. Researcher engagement with open access publishing models was low, and few participants had self-archived their publications in the university's institutional repository. Participants reported low interest in altmetrics, and few used online tools to promote or share their research results.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased efforts should be made to promote and develop services for funding and grant applications. New services are needed to assist researchers in maximizing their research impact and to increase researcher awareness of the benefits of open access publishing models, self-archiving, and altmetrics.

TI Longitudinal relationship between social media activity and article
   citations in the journal Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
SO GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPACT
AB Background and Aims: Social media activity in the area of scientific journal publications has increased significantly over the last decade. Several studies have suggested that journal article citations can be positively impacted by an increase in social media activity. Preliminary data have also suggested that published articles in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology that were discussed on Twitter were independently associated with higher citation rates compared with those that were not. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (GIE) is the most widely cited endoscopy-focused journal in the world. We aimed to assess the association of social media exposure of published articles in GIE and its impact on article citations.
   Methods: Data regarding journal article publication status, number of citations per article, and social media exposure per article using Altmetric data were collected from the publisher. All original articles published in GIE from 2000 to 2016 were reviewed. Editorials, case reports, and other nonresearch correspondence were excluded. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess for independent Altmetric predictors of higher citation rates over time. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of an article mention on various social media platforms and whether it was cited during the study period.
   Results: A total of 2361 original research articles were evaluated; 2050 articles (86.8%) were cited at least once during the follow-up period. Mean number of citations per article was 16.8 +/- 23. The average Altmetric Attention score was 2.0 +/- 13. The most profound independent predictor of article citation was whether an article was tweeted (odds ratio [OR], 14.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.93-22.45). Other predictors were Facebook posts (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.51) and number of Mendeley readers (OR, 1.359; 95% CI, 1.28-1.45). On multivariable linear regression, number of tweeters (beta = 2.3, P = .022), F1000 reviews (beta = 5.87, P < .001), policy documents (beta = 7.6, P < .001), and number of Mendeley readers (beta = 14.21, P < .001) were significantly associated with higher citation rates of published articles.
   Conclusions: For original articles published in GIE, there was a strong association between social media exposure on Twitter and rates of journal article citations. To a lesser degree, Facebook posts and Mendeley readers also were associated with a higher rate of article citations. This could represent both cause and effect and may be representative of higher quality articles being more commonly mentioned on social media by third-party users. A randomized controlled study evaluating different degrees of social media exposure on individual articles could be considered to further assess for causality.

ID SOCIAL NETWORK SITES; COMMODIFICATION; WORK
AB Using the idea of a digitally based, constructed, and virtual researcher self, we explore ways in which social media, social network sites, and social networking present researcher self(ves) and research product(s) to a range of interested others. We argue that in a climate where visibility of, and attention for, both research and researchers is paramount, we are seeing the resilience and morphing of metrics and all they represent into new and different forms driven by possibilities afforded by social media and social networking. This poses new forms of old problems for qualitative inquiry and qualitative inquirers. However, at the same time, used with care, social media and social networking may open up possibilities for qualitative research to be seen and heard, and better reach those for whom our research is of interest and use. Central questions underpinning the discussion are: How can we use, rather than be used by, the possibilities afforded to our research and researcher selves by social media and social networking? If we cannot always control how our researcher self is presented in social media and social networking sites, how might we resist the researcher self being assembled for us by others such as by their use of altmetrics? Crucially, how can we make sure that qualitative inquiry and expertise is the focus, rather than the gaining of attention, thus avoiding the proliferation of a type of Kardashian qualitative inquiry-related trendsetter and opinion maker based more on ability to gain attention than expertise in qualitative inquiry.

AB Social networking sites play a significant role in altmetrics. While 90% of all altmetric mentions come from Twitter, the known microscopic and macroscopic properties of Twitter altmetrics data are limited. In this study, we present a large-scale analysis of Twitter altmetrics data using social network analysis techniques on the mention' network of Twitter users. Exploiting the network-level properties of over 1.4 million tweets, corresponding to 77,757 scholarly articles, this study focuses on the following aspects of Twitter altmetrics data: (a) the influence of organizational accounts; (b) the formation of disciplinary communities; (c) the cross-disciplinary interaction among Twitter users; (d) the network motifs of influential Twitter users; and (e) testing the small-world property. The results show that Twitter-based social media communities have unique characteristics, which may affect social media usage counts either directly or indirectly. Therefore, instead of treating altmetrics data as a black box, the underlying social media networks, which may either inflate or deflate social media usage counts, need further scrutiny.

AB The transformative consumer research (TCR) movement comprises a group of academic researchers exploring new ways to do research with greater social impact. Many of these researchers include key stakeholders within the research process towards creating studies with greater awareness, use, and societal benefit. This study empirically explores whether these initial research efforts have elicited more awareness among other scholars and beyond the academy to society. We find encouraging evidence that TCR and relational engagement have high scholarly impact and are more societally influential as measured by citation and altmetric analyses.

AB Objective To characterise how online media coverage of journal articles on cancer funded by the US government varies by cancer type and stage of the cancer control continuum and to compare the disease prevalence rates with the amount of funded research published for each cancer type and with the amount of media attention each receives.
   Design A cross-sectional study.
   Setting The United States.
   Participants The subject of analysis was 11 436 journal articles on cancer funded by the US government published in 2016. These articles were identified via PubMed and characterised as receiving online media attention based on data provided by Altmetric.
   Results 16.8% (n=1925) of articles published on US government-funded research were covered in the media. Published journal articles addressed all common cancers. Frequency of journal articles differed substantially across the common cancers, with breast cancer (n=1284), lung cancer (n=630) and prostate cancer (n=586) being the subject of the most journal articles. Roughly one-fifth to one-fourth of journal articles within each cancer category received online media attention. Media mentions were disproportionate to actual burden of each cancer type (ie, incidence and mortality), with breast cancer articles receiving the most media mentions. Scientific articles also covered the stages of the cancer continuum to varying degrees. Across the 13 most common cancer types, 4.4% (n=206) of articles focused on prevention and control, 11.7% (n=550) on diagnosis and 10.7% (n=502) on therapy.
   Conclusions Findings revealed a mismatch between prevalent cancers and cancers highlighted in online media. Further, journal articles on cancer control and prevention received less media attention than other cancer continuum stages. Media mentions were not proportional to actual public cancer burden nor volume of scientific publications in each cancer category. Results highlight a need for continued research on the role of media, especially online media, in research dissemination.

AB Background: To increase awareness, search for solutions, and drive change, disparity-related research needs to be strategically disseminated. This study aimed to quantify whether a social media strategy could: (1) amplify dissemination of gender equity-related articles and (2) collect proposed solutions to gender equity issues.
   Methods: In April 2018, eight published journal articles covering separate gender equity issues were presented in a 1-hour Twitter chat hosted by Physician's Weekly. Metrics data were collected before, during, and after the chat. During the chat, one question related to each article was tweeted at a time. Qualitative data were extracted from responses and evaluated for thematic content.
   Results: In the 16-hour period during and following the chat, we tallied 1500 tweets from 294 participants and 8.6 million impressions (potential views). The Altmetric Attention Score of each article increased (average, 126.5 points; range, 91-208 points). Within the respective journal, the Altmetric Rank of seven articles improved (range, 3 to >= 19), while the eighth maintained its # 1 rank. The one article for which share and download data were available experienced a 729% increase in shares following prechat posts and another 113% bump after the chat, a 1667% increase overall (n = 45-795). Similarly, downloads, and presumably reads, increased 712% following prechat posts and another 47% bump after the chat, a 1093% increase overall (n = 394-4700). We tallied 181 potential solutions to the eight gender equity-related questions.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that social media can be used strategically to increase the dissemination of research articles and collect solution-focused feedback.

TI Cochrane overviews: how can we optimize their impact on evidence-based
   rehabilitation?

   GUIDANCE
AB INTRODUCTION: Overviews (i.e. reviews of multiple systematic reviews) comprise a relatively novel methodology to systematically synthesize research findings. Overviews aim for a beneficial impact on clinical practice, but their methods and pathways to impact have so far not been mapped. The aim of this paper was to inform recommendations for optimizing impact on rehabilitation practice and research by mapping methods and pathways to impact in Cochrane overviews relevant to rehabilitation.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically searched and identified published Cochrane overviews (to June 2018) relevant to rehabilitation. We extracted data and compared overviews on key characteristics, methods of evidence synthesis, statements about impact, and access metrics. We explored one overview in detail regarding beneficiaries, activities and outputs, mapped potential pathways to impact, and, using an iterative process, refined this into a generic map. Through exploration of all synthesized data, we propose further recommendations for planning, conducting and reporting of future overviews in order to optimize impact on rehabilitation.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified seven Cochrane overviews relevant to rehabilitation. Their focus and methods varied, but they were broadly related to rehabilitation interventions for populations of people with diverse long-term conditions. Overviews also varied regarding their intended impact; only 4 overviews identified specific beneficiaries. All overviews included multiple tables and figures, but only one synthesized key findings into a single figure. For five overviews, the Altmetric Attention Score (a weighted count of attention that an output receives based on a range of online sources) was in the top 5% of all research outputs scored by Altmetric. The overview within our worked example had four key impact goals, each with different beneficiaries and required actions; this example led to a generic map of potential pathways to impact for other overviews.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cochrane overviews have the potential to play a key role in knowledge translation and therefore to be useful in supporting evidence-based rehabilitation practice. However, current overviews relating to rehabilitation differ in methods, approaches and intended impact, and sometimes fall short of promoting easy access to key information for beneficiaries. Future Cochrane overviews should address topics of importance to key beneficiaries and clearly outline potential pathways to impact in order to have a potential beneficial impact on evidence-based rehabilitation and to improve rehabilitation outcomes.

AB The multidimensional nature of digital libraries evaluation domain poses several challenges to the research communities that intend to assess criteria, methods, products and tools, and also practice them. The amount of scientific production that is published in the domain hinders and disorientates the interested researchers. These researchers need guidance to exploit effectively the considerable amount of data and the diversity of methods, as well as to identify new research goals and develop their plans for future studies. This paper proposes a methodological pathway to investigate the core topics that structure the digital library evaluation domain and their impact. Further to the exploration of these topical entities, this study investigates also the researchers that contribute substantially to key topics, their communities and their relationships. The proposed methodology exploits topic modeling and network analysis in combination with citation and altmetrics analysis on a corpus consisting of the digital library evaluation papers presented in JCDL, ECDL/TDPL and ICADL conferences in the period 2001-2013.

AB Altmetrics indices are increasingly applied to measure scholarly influence in recent years because they can reflect the influence of research outputs more timely comparing with traditional measurements. Simultaneously, artificial intelligence (AI), as an emerging interdiscipline, has a rapid development in these years. Traditional indices can't reflect the influence of the AI research outputs quickly, thus more timely altmetrics indices are needed. In this paper, we conduct four studies about altmetrics indices and AI research outputs based on the datasets collected from Altmetric.com and Scopus database. First, we provide a review of the research status in the AI field. Second, we show the AI researches that attracted the most attention. Third, we demonstrate the general effectiveness of altmetrics indices in the AI field. Last, we examine the effectiveness of altmetrics indices for different levels of AI journal papers and AI conference papers. Our results indicate that there is a rapid increase of AI publications and the public has paid more attention to AI research outputs since 2011. It is found that altmetrics indices are effective to discriminate highly cited publications and publications whose citation counts increase quickly. Among all Altmetric sub-indicators, Number of Mendeley readers is the most effective. Moreover, the results indicate that altmetrics indices are more effective in high levels of AI journal papers and AI conference papers. The main contribution of this paper is investigating the effectiveness of altmetrics indices from the perspective of different levels of publications. This study lays the foundation for further investigations about effectiveness of altmetrics indices from new perspectives, and it has important implication for the studies about the impact of social media on the scientific community.

AB In this paper, we made a survey on the prediction capability of bibliometric indices and alternative metrics on the future success of articles by establishing a machine learning framework. Twenty-three bibliometric and alternative indices were collected to establish the feature space for the predication task. In order to eliminate the possible redundancy in feature space, three feature selection techniques of Relief-F, principal component analysis and entropy weighted method were used to rank the features according to their contribution to the original data set. Combining the fractal dimension of the data set, the intrinsic features which can better represent the original feature space were extracted. Three classifiers of Naive Bayes, KNN and random forest were performed to detect the classification performance of these features. Experimental results show that both bibliometric indices and alternative metrics are beneficial to articles' growth. Early citation features, early Web usage statistics, as well as the reputation of the first author are the most valuable indicators in making an article more influential in the future.

AB In this paper, we addressed the question of whether a video abstract of an article affects its citation counts. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the research articles published in New Journal of Physics during 2010 and 2016. Articles with video abstract (N=315) as the experimental group, were matched 1:2, with articles without video abstract (N=630) as the control group, by the same publishing issue, same article type. Specifically, the articles lacking video abstract that appeared immediately before and after each experimental group article were included in the control group. A negative binomial regression model was employed to analyze the data. After controlling for the characteristics of articles (including the number of authors, international co-authorship, character counts of title, character counts of text-based abstract, keyword counts, reference counts, page counts and funding), our results showed that articles with video abstract (experimental group) compared to the articles without video abstract (control group) were expected to have a rate 1.206 times greater for citation counts. This study suggests that a video abstract can potentially serve as a useful genre of a research article for receiving more citation counts.

ID SOCIETAL IMPACT; ACKNOWLEDGMENTS; ALTMETRICS
AB 'Social media metrics' are bursting into science studies as emerging new measures of impact related to scholarly activities. However, their meaning and scope as scholarly metrics is still far from being grasped. This research seeks to shift focus from the consideration of social media metrics around science as mere indicators confined to the analysis of the use and visibility of publications on social media to their consideration as metrics of interaction and circulation of scientific knowledge across different communities of attention, and particularly as metrics that can also be used to characterize these communities. Although recent research efforts have proposed tentative typologies of social media users, no study has empirically examined the full range of Twitter user's behavior within Twitter and disclosed the latent dimensions in which activity on Twitter around science can be classified. To do so, we draw on the overall activity of social media users on Twitter interacting with research objects collected from the Altmetic.com database. Data from over 1.3 million unique users, accounting for over 14 million tweets to scientific publications, is analyzed. Based on an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, four latent dimensions are identified: 'Science Engagement', 'Social Media Capital', 'Social Media Activity' and Science Focus'. Evidence on the predominant type of users by each of the four dimensions is provided by means of VOSviewer term maps of Twitter profile descriptions. This research breaks new ground for the systematic analysis and characterization of social media users' activity around science.

AB Aim We aimed to rank dental journals according to the number of Twitter mentions related to their articles. We set out to analyse and visualise the bibliometric characteristics of highly tweeted articles.
   Methods Twitter mentions were extracted from the Altmetric database. Bibliometric data were obtained from the Web of Science and analysed by VOSviewer software. Hotspots among highly tweeted articles visualised by keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Bibliographic coupling network analysis was used to find the most influential journals, institutions and countries.
   Results A total of 20,520 Twitter accounts which shared 93,776 tweets related to 23,686 articles from 91 journals were analysed. The British Dental Journal had the highest number of Twitter mentions related to dental articles. Children, dental caries, and periodontal disease were the hottest topics among the 134 highly tweeted dental articles. @The_BDJ had the highest number of tweets related to dental articles, followed by @Dddent2 and @gary_takacs. @The BDA had the highest number of followers, followed by @Dddent2 and @The_BDJ.
   Discussion Ground breaking issues such as genomic medicine, stem cells, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence were not seen among the highly tweeted dental articles. In the 'Twittersphere', some independent scientists are more active than well-known dental organisations and journals. The journals are strongly recommended to be proactive in Twittersphere, to set up their own Twitter profile, and to promote their visibility and social impact by immediately tweeting the articles. Researchers should be alert to the overuse of Twitter in scholarly communications. The Kardashian index will be a useful tool to measure the over/under activity of a researcher on Twitter.

AB The growth of a country is heavily depending on its investment over science and technology. In fact, the progress in computer science research serves as a vital factor in the development of a country. Interestingly, despite that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is located near each other, they do not share a similar level of ICT development, which leads to a digital divide among them. Thus, it is crucial to bibliometrically evaluate and compare the computer science research output over the latest decade (i.e., 2009 to 2018) among these countries. With the data gathered from the Web of Science, this study seeks to uncover the research focus of all ASEAN countries over the latest decade by analyzing the author keywords. Majority of the ASEAN was having a different research focus, explaining the varied levels of ICT development. Practical and theoretical implications are then offered accordingly.

AB Background Alternative metrics (Altmetrics) based on mentions in online media is a new tool that can help identify articles that have the most influence on diverse public audiences. Purpose To determine the 100 most mentioned articles in the field of neuroimaging and to analyze their characteristics. Material and Methods We selected the 668 journals that were considered to potentially publish neuroimaging articles. Using the Altmetric.com search tool, we identified the 100 most mentioned neuroimaging articles based on the highest Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) within selected journals. Each article was evaluated for several characteristics including AAS, number of citations, journal title, impact factor of journal, year of publication, authorship, country, type of document, disease entity, and imaging technique. Results The AAS for the top 100 articles were in the range of 145-1467. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience published the largest number of articles (n = 9), followed by Radiology (n = 8) and Neurology (n = 8). All articles were published during 2006-2018, with 56% of articles being published in 2016-2018. The majority of articles originated from the United States (n = 56), were original articles (n = 81), covered normal population (n = 67), and used functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 56). Sasaki was the most prolific, authoring three of the most mentioned neuroimaging articles. Conclusion This study presents a detailed list of the 100 most mentioned neuroimaging articles in online media, thus providing useful information on the dissemination of neuroimaging research to the general public.

AB Background and purpose A lternative metrics (altmetrics), based on mentions in online media, is a new tool that can help to identify the most influential articles to diverse public audiences. This article aimed to determine the 100 most mentioned articles in the field of neurointervention and to analyze their characteristics.
   Materials and methods We selected the 808 journals that were considered journals potentially publishing articles on neurointervention. We also selected articles using keywords. Using the A ltmetric.com search tool, we identified the 101 most mentioned neurointervention articles based on the highest altmetric attention scores (AASs) within selected journals and articles. Each article was evaluated for several characteristics including AAS, number of citations, journal title, journal category, impact factor of the journal, year of publication, authorship, country, type of document, and topic.
   Results The AASs for the top 101 articles ranged from 1586 to 39. Stroke published the largest number of articles (19.8%) followed by the New England Journal of Medicine (17.8%). The majority of articles were published in multidisciplinary journals (38.6%), were published in 2017-2018 (43.6%), originated from the USA (54.5%), were original articles (66.3%), and dealt with intra-arterial thrombolysis or thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke (58.4%). Tudor G Jovin was the most prolific author, authoring 18 of the most mentioned neurointervention articles
   Conclusions This study presents a detailed list of the 101 most mentioned neurointervention articles in online media, thus providing useful information on the dissemination of neurointervention research to the general public.

AB In the battle for better science, the research community must obliterate, at times, works from the publication record, a process known as retraction. Additionally, publications and papers accumulate an altmetric attention score, which is a complementary metric to citation-based metrics. We used the citations, Journal Impact Factor, time between publication and retraction and the reasons behind retraction in order to find determinants of the retracted papers altmetric attention score. To find these determinants we compared two samples, one of retractions with top altmetric attention scores and one of retractions with altmetric attention scores chosen at random. We used a binary choice model to estimate the probability of being retracted due to misconduct or error. The model shows positive effects of altmetric scores and the time between publication and retraction on the probability to be retracted due to misconduct in the top sample. We conclude that there is an association between retraction due to misconduct and higher altmetric attention scores within the top sample.

AB Twitter accounts have already been used in many scientometric studies, but the meaningfulness of the data for societal impact measurements in research evaluation has been questioned. Earlier research focused on social media counts and neglected the interactive nature of the data. We explore a new network approach based on Twitter data in which we compare author keywords to hashtags as indicators of topics. We analyze the topics of tweeted publications and compare them with the topics of all publications (tweeted and not tweeted). Our exploratory study is based on a comprehensive publication set of climate change research. We are interested in whether Twitter data are able to reveal topics of public discussions which can be separated from research-focused topics. We find that the most tweeted topics regarding climate change research focus on the consequences of climate change for humans. Twitter users are interested in climate change publications which forecast effects of a changing climate on the environment and to adaptation, mitigation and management issues rather than in the methodology of climate-change research and causes of climate change. Our results indicate that publications using scientific jargon are less likely to be tweeted than publications using more general keywords. Twitter networks seem to be able to visualize public discussions about specific topics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Altmetrics promise useful support for assessing the impact of scientific works, including beyond the scholarly community and with very limited citation windows. Unfortunately, altmetrics scores are currently available only for recent articles and cannot be used as covariates in predicting long term impact of publications. However, the study of their statistical properties is a subject of evident interest to scientometricians. Applying the same approaches used in the literature to assess the universality of citation distributions, the intention here is to test whether the universal distribution also holds for Mendeley readerships. Results of the analysis carried out on a sample of publications randomly extracted from the Web of Science confirm that readerships seem to share similar shapes across fields and can be rescaled to a common and universal form. Such rescaling results as not particularly effective on the right tails. In other regions, rescaling causes a good collapse of field specific distributions, even for very recent publications.

ID EXPOSURE; PREVENTION; BEHAVIOR
AB BACKGROUND: Environmental exposures contribute to multiple diseases in children; yet, few pediatricians have training in pediatric environmental health (PEH), and few academic health centers have PEH expertise. To build national capacity in PEH, the Academic Pediatric Association (APA) launched a professional development program that since 2002 has encouraged the establishment of post-residency/post-doctoral training programs, supported a special interest group, and convened an annual mentored retreat for PEH trainees.
   OBJECTIVE: Describe the APA's professional development program in PEH and assess its impact by tracking careers of former trainees.
   METHODS: Careers were tracked through interviews with trainees and program directors supplemented by searches of institutional websites. Publication listings were obtained through PubMed. Publication impact was assessed using bibliometric and altmetric measures. Grant histories were accessed through the National Institutes of Health RePORTER project. Information on advocacy work was obtained through interviews with program directors.
   RESULTS: Fifty-five trainees (36 physicians and 19 health scientists) completed PEH training and attended the APA retreat between 2002 and 2017. Forty-one (75%) are pursuing academic careers, 11 are associate or full professors, 11 are practicing general pediatrics or a pediatric subspecialty, 2 are Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologists, and 1 is a data scientist. Forty-two former trainees (76%) listed "environment" or "environmental" in their job titles or on their websites. Former trainees have published 632 scientific papers. These papers have been cited 3094 times, have a relative citation ratio of 2.97, and have been read or viewed 1,274,388 times. Twenty-one former trainees have been awarded 43 National Institutes of Health grants. Trainees have developed education and advocacy skills by teaching medical students and residents, presenting grand rounds, preparing policy papers, presenting legislative testimony, and making presentations to public audiences.
   CONCLUSIONS: The APA's professional development program has contributed to the expansion of national capacity in PEH. Former trainees are populating the field, generating new knowledge, and moving into leadership positions.

AB The social web appears a promising environment to study the societal impact of research, and, although platforms such as Twitter appear to be popular to share scientific content, little is known about the outreach of scientific communication on social media. By surveying a sample of Twitter users who are also followers of communication and Library and Information Science (LIS) researchers, this article aims to understand who is interacting with researchers on Twitter and if the activity of following allows to get closer to science and research. A survey was sent to all followers of 9 active researchers, and 53 responses were collected and analyzed. According to the results, followers are mostly professionals (49%) although the higher education sector (36%) accounts for an important part of the audience. Twitter allows respondents to keep updated, feel as a part of the scientific community and gain more visibility, whereas interactions appear as an important though secondary facet of these users' activity on Twitter. Finally, participants consider that they do not have influence on the scientific process, maybe because the flow of information on Twitter occurs mostly as retweeting in an unidirectional fashion. More research is needed in order to understand better interactions and engagement on social media before they can be quantified and measured as indicators of societal impact of research.

AB This conceptual exploration revisits a key question from earlier work (Greenhow & Gleason, 2014): What is scholarship reconsidered in the age of social media? Social scholarship is a framework that expanded Boyers' (1990) conceptualization of scholarship to consider how social media affect discovery and research, teaching and learning, integration, and application. This paper critically reflects on how social scholarship continues to evolve in light of changing understandings in the field of educational technology and the role social media play in the academy. We provide recent examples of social scholarship such as altmetrics, interdisciplinary projects, crowdsourced educational technology syllabi and reconsideration of the needs of research participants. Moreover, we share concrete examples of how scholars might enact social scholarship, with what benefits and challenges, and surface new concerns regarding openness, equity, access, literacy, privacy and ethical considerations. Our paper concludes with recommendations for preparing scholars to enact social scholarship while mitigating the challenges it poses.

AB The aim of this study is to analyse the occurrence of communication journals in the so-called Altmetrics (Facebook, Mendeley, Twitter, etc.) and how these indicators relate to each other and to the citations received. To this end, we study how the articles published by the Journal Citation Reports of the Web of Science for the 5-year period 2013-2017 on the Altmetric.com platform are registered. The results show how only a few platforms have significant coverage for studying the whole and in the case of Mendeley and Twitter, the coverage is superior to the citations offered by Web of Science. There is a proven relationship between citations and their occurrence on social media and platforms and their intensity varies by product. In general, the journals with the highest number of citations (Journal of Computer Mediated, Journal of Communication or New Media & Society) with few exceptions (Continuum) stand out.

AB The growing informational volume boosted by the development of Information and Communication Technologies has increased the focus on the seek for visibility of publications in the scientific field, raising the degree of relevance of the academic recognition by researchers, resulting in questions about the perception of the traditional measures of evaluation of the academic impact. The goal of this study is to identify the visibility of the Brazilian scientific production of Information Science area, from the periodicals indexed in BRAPCI (Referral Database of Journals Papers in Information Science), with the use of data of altmetric indicators from Online Social Networking services and databases related with reference management websites. The results show that the altmetric data still have a low level of adherence in the Brazilian journals context related to Information Science. Among the factors involved, stand out the lack of identifiers in approximately eighty percent of the journals indexed by BRAPCI and the low level of mentions on publications into the Online Social Networks services. It is concluded that these alternative metrics to complement the traditional metrics still need to be more explored theoretically and, as a requirement, technically through an implement process by publishers.

AB The advent of social media has enabled us to explore the impact of academic entities beyond the conventional bibliometric community. The traditional bibliometric indicators such as citation count, h-index and SNIP metrics aim to represent the propagation of knowledge in the academic world rather than the impact of the research on the wider world. In this study, we are interested in measuring the impact of the academic world on social media. We first create the 2-layered graph where the first layer is the bipartite graph between academic and social media entities and a second layer is the graph between social media entities. Then, we employed the heat diffusion-based metrics to measure the influence of academic entities in social media. Thus, we evaluate the academic entities by (1) predicting links between academic entities and social media and (2) suggesting memes for the academic entities. Our analysis on predicting links between scientist and social media entities showed the AUC-ROC score of 0.73 and the AUC-PR score of 0.30. Similarly, predicting links between scientific publications and social media entities showed the AUC-ROC score of 0.80 and the AUC-PR score of 0.19. Our approach can also suggest textual memes for scientific publications.

AB Purpose Based on the data from Figshare repositories, the purpose of this paper is to analyze which research data are actively produced and shared in the interdisciplinary field of library and information science (LIS). Design/methodology/approach Co-occurrence analysis was performed on keywords assigned to research data in the field of LIS, which were archived in the Figshare repository. By analyzing the keyword network using the pathfinder algorithm, the study identifies key areas where data production is actively conducted in LIS, and examines how these results differ from the conventional intellectual structure of LIS based on co-citation or bibliographic coupling analysis. Findings Four major domains - Open Access, Scholarly Communication, Data Science and Informatics - and 15 sub-domains were created. The keywords with the highest global influence appeared as follows, in descending order: "open access," "scholarly communication" and "altmetrics." Originality/value This is the first study to understand the key areas that actively produce and utilize data in the LIS field.

AB This paper aims to map and identify topics of interest within the field of Microbiology and identify the main sources driving such attention. We combine data from Web of Science and Altmetric.com, a platform which retrieves mentions to scientific literature from social media and other non-academic communication outlets. We focus on the dissemination of microbial publications in Twitter, news media and policy briefs. A two-mode network of social accounts shows distinctive areas of activity. We identify a cluster of papers mentioned solely by regional news media. A central area of the network is formed by papers discussed by the three outlets. A large portion of the network is driven by Twitter activity. When analyzing top actors contributing to such network, we observe that more than half of the Twitter accounts are bots, mentioning 32% of the documents in our dataset. Within news media outlets, there is a predominance of popular science outlets. With regard to policy briefs, both international and national bodies are represented. Finally, our topic analysis shows that the thematic focus of papers mentioned varies by outlet. While news media cover the wider range of topics, policy briefs are focused on translational medicine and bacterial outbreaks.

DE Altmetrics; Influential users; Twitter; Highly cited articles
AB The relationship between influential tweeters and highly cited articles in the field of information sciences was analysed using Twitter data gathered by Altmetric.com from July 2011 through February 2017. The dataset consists of more than 10,000 tweets, and these mentions, retweets and followers were used to generate a connected, undirected graph. This graph reveals the most influential tweeters by identifying the largest drop in the eigenvalue of adjacency or affinity matrix of a graph when certain nodes are removed; those which, when deleted, cause the greatest drop in the eigenvalue of the graph are considered to be the most influential. The machine-learning model applied in this work utilizes a feature vector containing the accumulated sum of the rank scores of those influential users who tweet a given article, along with known altmetric features such as the user type and post counts for various social media. Finally, the supervised-learning model was trained using Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers with 11 features, including the sum of the ranks of influential users who tweet a given article in our dataset. The results were analysed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Precision Recall (PR) curves, which give the commendable outcomescompared to thebaseline model. We found that, for the classification of highly cited articles, Twitter users' score for influence is the most important feature. Finally, we show that our modelwhich was trained bytaking the score for influence into considerationoutperforms the baseline, at 79% for ROC and 90% for PR with the Random Forest Model, effectively identifying the highly cited articles.

AB Bibliometrics use statistical methods to measure the scholarly impact of publications. Bibliometrics are categorized as conventional metrics or alternative metrics. Conventional metrics have often been considered the standard to measure the impact of publication-related scholarship. With the growing popularity of social media and ease of instantaneous distribution of information globally, alternative metrics have become an important complementary measure of scholarly activity. Bibliometrics may provide a standard performance measurement that may be used for tenure and/or promotion among academic institutions. The alternative metric industry has shown considerable growth with increasingly improved algorithms working towards standardization. Together, conventional metrics and alternative metrics may synergistically complement each other to provide an accelerated translation from research to clinical care that may lead to tremendous benefits in patients. All physicians and other healthcare professionals should receive training in bibliometrics and understand the potential impact of professional social media use.

ID H-INDEX; GENERAL-SURGERY
AB BackgroundThe Hirsch index, often used to assess research impact, suffers from questionable validity within the context of General Surgery, and consequently adapted bibliometrics and altmetrics have emerged, including the r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index. This study aimed to assess the relative value of these novel bibliometrics in a single UK Deanery General Surgical Consultant cohort.MethodFive indices (h, r, m, g and i10) and altmetric scores (AS) were calculated for 151 general surgical consultants in a UK Deanery. Indices and AS were calculated from publication data via the Scopus search engine with assessment of construct validity and reliability.ResultsThe median number of publications, h-index, r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index were 13 (range 0-389), 5 (range 0-63), 5.2 (range 0-64.8), 0.33 (range 0-1.5), 10 (range 0-125) and 4 (range 0-245), respectively. Correlation coefficients of r-index, m-index, g-index and i10-index with h-index were 0.913 (p<0.001), 0.716 (p<0.001), 0.961 (p<0.001) and 0.939 (p<0.001), respectively. Significant variance was observed when the cohort was ranked by individual bibliometric measures; the median ranking shifts were: r-index -2 (-46 to +23); m-index -6.5 (-53 to +22); g-index -0.5 (-24 to +13); and i10-index 0 (-8 to +11), respectively (p<0.001). The median altmetric score and AS index were 0 (range 0-225.5) and 1 (range 0-10), respectively; AS index correlated strongly with h-index (correlation coefficient 0.390, p<0.001).ConclusionsAdapted bibliometric indices appear to be equally valid measures of evaluating academic productivity, impact and reach.

AB Recently, social media has become a potentially new way for scholarly journals to disseminate and evaluate research outputs. Scholarly journals have started promoting their research articles to a wide range of audiences via social media platforms. This article aims to investigate the social media presence of scholarly journals across disciplines. We extracted journals from Web of Science and searched for the social media presence of these journals on Facebook and Twitter. Relevant metrics and content relating to the journals' social media accounts were also crawled for data analysis. From our results, the social media presence of scholarly journals lies between 7.1% and 14.2% across disciplines; and it has shown a steady increase in the last decade. The popularity of scholarly journals on social media is distinct across disciplines. Further, we investigated whether social media metrics of journals can predict the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). We found that the number of followers and disciplines have significant effects on the JIF. In addition, a word co-occurrence network analysis was also conducted to identify popular topics discussed by scholarly journals on social media platforms. Finally, we highlight challenges and issues faced in this study and discuss future research directions.

TI Altmetric scores: An early indicator of research impact
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article we test whether metrics of online attention describing research can provide information on research quality and societal impact that is not found in citation data alone. Our approach is to set up a traditional model in which the true quality or impact of a university department is determined by a panel of experts, but a citation metric is regarded as a reasonable proxy. However, the model assumes that the information contained in the scores provided by an expert panel exceeds that contained in a citation metric (HEFCE, 2015). Finally, we extend this model by including altmetric data to see if it adds information about a department's performance that cannot be gleaned from citations alone. We find the presence of altmetric data for the cited underpinning research to be highly correlated with peer review scores for societal impact. Conversely, no such connection was seen with the assessment of research quality. Our findings therefore suggest altmetric data could be useful as an aid to assessing impact.

AB Citizen science (CS) aims primarily to create a new scientific culture able to improve upon the triple interaction between science, society, and policy in the dual pursuit of more democratic research and decision-making informed by sound evidence. It is both an aim and an enabler of open science (OS), to which it contributes by involving citizens in research and encouraging participation in the generation of new knowledge. This study analyses scientific output on CS using bibliometric techniques and Web of Science (WoS) data. Co-occurrence maps are formulated to define subject clusters as background for an analysis of the impact of each on social media. Four clusters are identified: HEALTH, BIO, GEO and PUBLIC. The profiles for the four clusters are observed to be fairly similar, although BIO and HEALTH are mentioned more frequently in blogposts and tweets and BIO and PUBLIC in Facebook and newsfeeds. The findings also show that output in the area has grown since 2010, with a larger proportion of papers (66%) mentioned in social media than reported in other studies. The percentage of open access documents (30.7%) is likewise higher than the overall mean for all areas.

AB Altmetrics have been proposed as a way to assess the societal impact of research. Although altmetrics are already in use as impact or attention metrics in different contexts, it is still not clear whether they really capture or reflect societal impact. This study is based on altmetrics, citation counts, research output and case study data from the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF), and peers' REF assessments of research output and societal impact. We investigated the convergent validity of altmetrics by using two REF datasets: publications submitted as research output (PRO) to the REF and publications referenced in case studies (PCS). Case studies, which are intended to demonstrate societal impact, should cite the most relevant research papers. We used the MHq' indicator for assessing impact - an indicator which has been introduced for count data with many zeros. The results of the first part of the analysis show that news media as well as mentions on Facebook, in blogs, in Wikipedia, and in policy-related documents have higher MHq' values for PCS than for PRO. Thus, the altmetric indicators seem to have convergent validity for these data. In the second part of the analysis, altmetrics have been correlated with REF reviewers' average scores on PCS. The negative or close to zero correlations question the convergent validity of altmetrics in that context. We suggest that they may capture a different aspect of societal impact (which can be called unknown attention) to that seen by reviewers (who are interested in the causal link between research and action in society).

AB Alternative metrics (aka altmetrics) are gaining increasing interest in the scientometrics community as they can capture both the volume and quality of attention that a research work receives online. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge about their effectiveness as a mean for measuring the impact of research if compared to traditional citation-based indicators. This work aims at rigorously investigating if any correlation exists among indicators, either traditional (i.e. citation count and h-index) or alternative (i.e. altmetrics) and which of them may be effective for evaluating scholars. The study is based on the analysis of real data coming from the National Scientific Qualification procedure held in Italy by committees of peers on behalf of the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the metrics provided by Publons about the scoring of publications and their relationship with impact measurements (bibliometric and altmetric indicators). Design/methodology/approach In January 2018, 45,819 research articles were extracted from Publons, including all their metrics (scores, number of pre and post reviews, reviewers, etc.). Using the DOI identifier, other metrics from altmetric providers were gathered to compare the scores of those publications in Publons with their bibliometric and altmetric impact in PlumX, Altmetric.com and Crossref Event Data. Findings The results show that: there are important biases in the coverage of Publons according to disciplines and publishers; metrics from Publons present several problems as research evaluation indicators; and correlations between bibliometric and altmetric counts and the Publons metrics are very weak (r<0.2) and not significant. Originality/value This is the first study about the Publons metrics at article level and their relationship with other quantitative measures such as bibliometric and altmetric indicators.

Open access scientific journals are potentially more likely to be shared and read by the public on social media. In this scenario, the scientific output of Brazil and Latin America, like those indexed in the SciELO database, which brings together relevant and open access scientific journals from the region, could benefit from altmetrics. However, analyzes of the representativeness of countries, languages and fields of knowledge in altmetrics reveal that the indicators need to be improved to value science in developing, non-English speaking, open access countries and national or regional relevance. This paper points out the limitations of altmetrics for science in Latin America, by analyzing the social media behavior of scholars and society, the presence of different languages to share articles, as well as the data that generate altmetrics, such as the ones produced by the British data provider Altmetric.com. Altmetrics have not been able to portray the attention that Brazilian scientific papers have received in social media, despite the efforts made by journals to disseminate science and engage with the public. It is necessary to expand data collection on Facebook, of contents and channels in Portuguese and Spanish, as well as to expand data collection of blogs and news outlets in the region.

AB The aim of this paper is to identify relations between the most reviews and ratings books in Goodreads and LibraryThing, two of the most impacting social networks of reading, and the list of top-selling titles in Amazon, the giant of the distribution. After a description of both networks and study of their web impact, we have conducted an analysis of correlations in order to see the level of dependency between statistical data they offer and the list of top-selling in Amazon. Only some slight evidences have been found. However there appears to be a strong or moderate correlation between the rest of the data, according to that we propose a battery of indicators to measure the book impact on reading.

AB This study is the first comprehensive analysis to evaluate the impact of books in a particular field, namely, Chinese studies, authored by scholars at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Bibliometric and altmetric indicators were applied to evaluate the impact of books, and correlations between different indicators were analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficients. The results showed significant differences between impact ranks using both indicators. Bibliometric indicators, including citations, library holdings, and book reviews, mainly reflect the academic impact of books, while altmetric indicators, including Amazon sales and Goodreads ratings, mainly reflect the social impact of those books. The most influential books and scholars were obtained based on each of the two indicator types. This effort can benefit academic efforts to evaluate the impact of books using multiple indicators.

DT Article
AB Objective - This study analyzes scholarly publications supported by library open access funds, including author demographics, journal trends, and article impact. It also identifies and summarizes open access fund criteria and viability. The goal is to better understand the sustainability of open access funds, as well as identify potential best practices for institutions with open access funds.
   Methods - Publication data was solicited from universities with open access (OA) funds, and supplemented with publication and author metrics, including Journal Impact Factor, Altmetric Attention Score, and author h-index. Additionally, data was collected from OA fund websites,
   Results - Library OA funds tend to support faculty in science and medical fields. Impact varied widely, especially between disciplines, but a limited measurement indicated an overall smaller relative impact of publications funded by library OA funds. Many open access funds operate using similar criteria related to author and publication eligibility, which seem to be largely successful at avoiding the funding of articles published in predatory journals.
   Conclusions - Libraries have successfully funded many publications using criteria that could constitute best practices in this area. However, institutions with OA funds may need to identify opportunities to increase support for high-impact publications, as well as consider the financial stability of these funds. Alternative models for OA support are discussed in the context of an ever-changing open access landscape.

AB Challenges of the digital information environment web 2.0 transform the ways of bibliographic activities. Among the features of digital information environment are unstructured and heterogeneous data that consist digital information sources; erasing differences between publish and unpublish information that complicates the universal bibliographic control and selection of the information sources for libraries' collections; also the role of the user in the semantic web is changing from passive use of information to active involving in information creation, development and management, or human information interaction. The main trends of bibliographic activities in the digital information environment are the development of bibliographic metadata formats in the context of the universal bibliographic control of the digital sources web 2.0; design of the information architecture web 2.0 and information systems using the bibliographic principles of document identification, description, classification and labeling for digital documents and data and taking into account the usability and human factors requirements; management of folksonomies and web-services for user's personal bibliographic activities; usage of cloud computing to develop digital libraries and bibliographic services; integration libraries online catalogs with the interfaces of internet search engines in discovery systems; using new infometrics like altmetrics for bibliographic researches.

AB This work is the result of one of the components of a macro investigation, which seeks to develop a Model to identify the degree of linkage of a university with its environment; in this case, it is applied to the University of Antioquia (Medellin-Colombia). This component refers to the visibility and impact of investigators from the perspective and data offered by altmetrics. To that effect, the altmetrics data of 1,032 investigators from six areas of knowledge are reviewed, taking into account different academic, professional and social platforms, as well as an integrating platform of altmetrics indicators. Although this measurement refers to University of Antioquia investigators, the general methodology for data capture and interpretation may be extended to other universities that share the same investigation and scientific communication, and that from the altmetrics wish to identify the visibility and impact of their investigators and the linking of the institution with its environment, and complement in this way, the traditional bibliometric measurements or other measurements of the university environment, such as the Manual of Valencia.

AB Field of the information metrics studies with nine years of existence, altmetrics has in Brazil a history three years more recent. If, on the other hand, we consider the field more broadly, such as scientometric studies based on cybermetric or web-based data, we could identify older works. However, delimitation of the field occurred in 2010, when Jason Priem coined the term "altmetrics" via Twitter having arrived in Brazil as "altmetria" in 2013. In the exploratory bibliometric study here presented, we used the Lattes curriculum to identify articles and communications in congresses of researchers, with or without a doctorate degree, who work in the field of altmetrics in Brazil, their large areas and areas of expertise, geographical distribution and the evolution of data and thematic sources over the years. To this end, the identification of curricula was made through the advanced search in the Lattes Platform by the terms "altmetria", "altmetrico", "altmetrica", "altmetric" or "altmetrics". The 94 curricula found, 37 of which were doctors and 57 of non-doctors, had their contents filtered by the search terms used. Twenty-six articles were identified in periodicals and 36 communications in events. From the 94 researchers it is verified that 53 of them produced only in altmetrics and 41 with intercession with Facebook, Twitter or Mendeley. The field is dominated by researchers from the large area of Applied Social Sciences with emphasis on Information Science and to a lesser extent for Communication. Research focus have been evolving from more theoretical approaches towards practical, evaluative, critical and institutional and regional contexts.

AB Digital and social media have grown exponentially to become highly influential spheres of public communication - increasingly crowded, contested, and corrupted, and increasingly in need of scholarly engagement. As public debate is conducted more through social and digital media, alternative metrics ('altmetrics') that am generated from social and digital media platforms become important as indicators of impact and engagement. We review the growth of amplifier platforms and the academic and contextual reasons for their growth. Amplifier platforms are defined to distinguish them from traditional media outlets (where the scholarly voice is mediated through and 'gatekept' by journalists, whose editors retain final control), personal blogs (very few of which can be maintained over time) and from social media platforms (where the scholarly voice is accorded no presumptive standing). A significant range of amplifier platforms is canvassed while acknowledging that in Australia, the amplifier platform the Conversation plays a central role.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report on the development and analysis of an internal bibliometric services workshop for subject librarians. Primary goals of the workshop were to create an opportunity for collegial knowledge and skill sharing, and to identify discipline specific gaps and future support requirements.
   Design/methodology/approach Two campus librarians who typically offer bibliometric support services used pre- and post-surveys to plan and assess the workshop for subject liaison librarians.
   Findings Subject librarians from across the university expressed interest in developing bibliometric support services. The 12 workshop participants (30 percent of subject librarians) support diverse areas including the humanities, social sciences, life sciences, education and outreach, and the school of business. Post-workshop survey respondents highlighted the contextualization of available measures and the appropriate application of metrics in different disciplines to be the most helpful topics covered. Finally, while the institution subscribes to several citation analysis databases, more familiarity with Google Scholar citations was requested to address user needs and preferences across the various disciplines. Most participants expressed interest in attending additional workshops.
   Originality/value This study showcases the experience of campus librarians working together across academic schools and disciplines to respond to the increasing demand for bibliometric and scholarly impact support services. While services such as citation analysis have typically been siloed in specific job descriptions or subject areas within the library, these are service areas that can benefit from internal library-collaboration opportunities and knowledge sharing.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the usage, captures, mentions, social media and citations of highly cited papers of Library and information science (LIS).
   Design/methodology/approach This study is quantitative research that was conducted using scientometrics and altmetrics indicators. The research sample consists of LIS classic papers. The papers contain highly cited papers of LIS that are introduced by Google Scholar. The research data have been gathered from Google Scholar, Scopus and Plum Analytics Categories. The data analysis has been done by Excel and SPSS applications.
   Findings The data indicate that among the highly cited articles of LIS, the highest score regarding the usage, captures, mentions and social media and the most abundance of citations belong to Citation advantage of open access articles and Usage patterns of collaborative tagging systems. Based on the results of Spearman statistical tests, there is a positive significant correlation between Google Scholar Citations and all studied indicators. However, only the correlation between Google Scholar Citations with capture metrics (p-value = 0.047) and citation metrics (p-value = 0.0001) was statistically significant.
   Originality/value Altmetrics indicators can be used as complement traditional indicators of Scientometrics to study the impact of papers. Therefore, the Altmetrics knowledge of LIS researchers and experts and practicing new studies in this field will be very important.

AB Students, academics and university administrators are increasingly using and producing digital platforms, including social media. This paper focuses on LinkedIn to start tackling the question of the effects on higher education as a sector, its actors and the established social practices. It argues that LinkedIn moves beyond the passivity of advertising to its users towards actively structuring digital labour markets, in which it strategically includes universities and its constituents. By introducing the term qualification altmetrics', the paper suggests that LinkedIn is building a global marketplace for skills to run in parallel to, or instead of university degrees. Qualification altmetrics might challenge the established practices of knowledge production and valuation.

ID CREDIT
AB The general approach of research impact evaluation is entirely based upon citations. But in the current Web2.0 era, this citation based evaluation process often do not include the generic discussions people make in social media, blogs, online scholarly discussion forums or even the online readership of the article. Aitmetrics, often referred as the article level metrics is a tool that have emerged, which crowd source all the non-citation based discussions from various web2.0 platforms and tries to reflect the overhaul attention that an article gets. Since its introduction, aitmetrics have been able to gather a good attention from the scientific community, and researchers are trying to evaluate if it does have scholarly value to complement the citation based impact measure process. The current study tries to evaluate altmetrics penetration in Indian research articles and the influence of altmetrics in the citation growth process. The problem was addressed taking the example of Indian research articles published in PLoS journals. Two hypothesis were set for the study and PLoS altmetrics data were taken to run the t-test for paired sample mean to test the hypothesis. Findings from the t-test estimated a low significant p value, hence rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternate hypothesis proving the positive influence of aitmetrics in the citation growth process for the Indian research articles in PLoS journals. Also the presence of aitmetrics data in the Indian research articles of PLoS journals is evaluated in the study.

AB The growing presence of research shared on social media, coupled with the increase in freely available research, invites us to ask whether scientific articles shared on platforms like Twitter diffuse beyond the academic community. We explore a new method for answering this question by identifying 11 articles from two open access biology journals that were shared on Twitter at least 50 times and by analyzing the follower network of users who tweeted each article. We find that diffusion patterns of scientific articles can take very different forms, even when the number of times they are tweeted is similar. Our small case study suggests that most articles are shared within single-connected communities with limited diffusion to the public. The proposed approach and indicators can serve those interested in the public understanding of science, science communication, or research evaluation to identify when research diffuses beyond insular communities.

TI Twitter Mentions and Academic Citations in the Urologic Literature
SO UROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL MEDIA; PROMOTION; INDEXES
AB OBJECTIVE To quantify the relationship between the number of Twitter mentions and the number of academic citations a urologic publication receives.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred and thirteen papers from 7 prominent urologic journals were examined 37 months after publication. Articles were evaluated with 2 citation based "bibliometrics" (Scopus, Google Scholar) and Twitter mentions were tracked using the Altmetric Bookmarklet. The number of article citations and Twitter mentions were compared using one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and bivariate fit analysis.
   RESULTS Seventy-three percent of articles had at least 1 Twitter mention. Forty-two percent of Twitter mentions occurred within the first week of the online publication date. Articles mentioned on Twitter had 2.0-fold more Scopus citations (P < .01), and 2.3-fold more Google Scholar citations (P < .01) compared to articles with no Twitter mentions. Female urologic articles had the greatest number of Twitter mentions (5.7 mentions/article) while pediatric urology had the fewest mean number of Twitter mentions (0.8 mentions/article). A total of 8.9% of papers were tweeted by their authors. Author tweeted articles were associated with a 12.3 (2.0-fold) and 15.5 (1.8-fold) mean citation increase for Scopus and Google Scholar (P < .01 and P = .01) compared to articles not shared by their authors on Twitter.
   CONCLUSION The majority of urologic publications are being shared on Twitter. The number of citations a urologic publication receives up to 3 years after release is positively associated with the number of mentions it has on Twitter. Twitter activity may be an early indicator of ultimate academic impact of an academic urologic paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Modern research is increasingly data-driven and reliant on bioinformatics software. Publication is a common way of introducing new software, but not all bioinformatics tools get published. Giving there are competing tools, it is important not merely to find the appropriate software, but have a metric for judging its usefulness. Journal's impact factor has been shown to be a poor predictor of software popularity; consequently, focusing on publications in high-impact journals limits user's choices in finding useful bioinformatics tools. Free and open source software repositories on popular code sharing platforms such as GitHub provide another venue to follow the latest bioinformatics trends. The open source component of GitHub allows users to bookmark and copy repositories that are most useful to them. This Perspective aims to demonstrate the utility of GitHub "stars," "watchers," and "forks" (GitHub statistics) as a measure of software impact. We compiled lists of impactful bioinformatics software and analyzed commonly used impact metrics and GitHub statistics of 50 genomics-oriented bioinformatics tools. We present examples of community-selected best bioinformatics resources and show that GitHub statistics are distinct from the journal's impact factor (JIF), citation counts, and alternative metrics (Altmetrics, CiteScore) in capturing the level of community attention. We suggest the use of GitHub statistics as an unbiased measure of the usability of bioinformatics software complementing the traditional impact metrics.

AB Progression-free survival is an increasingly popular surrogate end point for overall survival. The strength of correlation between the two end points varies, raising questions about the correlation between results of interim analyses that report mature progression-free survival data with the subsequent final publication that report overall survival.
   We searched PubMed from 2005 to 2015 for randomized controlled trials that measured both progression-free survival and overall survival. We matched interim publications that reported mature progression-free survival data with their final analyses that reported overall survival. We included 25 matched pairs and 8 unmatched interim analyses whose final analyses are not published. Our primary objectives are to compare interim publications with matched final publications in terms of journal prominence and Altmetric score and to compare progression-free survival and overall survival effect sizes.
   All interim analyses (n = 33) were prespecified and there was a statistically significant progression-free survival benefit in 31 (93.9%). Only eight matched final analyses had statistically significant overall survival data. Interim analyses were more often published in top-5 general medicine journals (P < 0.01) but not in top-5 oncology journals (P = 0.26). Altmetric scores were higher in interim analyses (P < 0.01). Progression-free survival effect sizes from interim analyses were a median of 31% larger than overall survival effect sizes from final analyses.
   Interim analyses with progression-free survival data may generate hype in oncology, as evidenced by journal impact factors and Altmetric scores. The cause of this hype may be due, in part, to large progression-free survival effect sizes. Regardless, in trials that investigate progression-free and overall survival, publishing interim analyses with mature progression-free survival data apart from the final analyses with mature overall survival should be cautioned.

AB In this article, we develop a method that uses altmetric data to analyse researchers' interactions, as a way of mapping the contexts of potential societal impact. In the face of an increasing policy demand for quantitative methodologies to assess societal impact, social media data (altmetrics) have been presented as a potential method to capture broader forms of impact. However, current altmetric indicators were extrapolated from traditional citation approaches and are seen as problematic for assessing societal impact. In contrast, established qualitative methodologies for societal impact assessment are based on interaction approaches. These argue that assessment should focus on mapping the contexts in which engagement among researchers and stakeholders takes place, as a means to understand the pathways to societal impact. Following these approaches, we propose to shift the use of altmetric data towards network analysis of researchers and stakeholders. We carry out two case studies, analysing researchers' networks with Twitter data. The comparison illustrates the potential of Twitter networks to capture disparate degrees of policy engagement. We propose that this mapping method can be used as an input within broader methodologies in case studies of societal impact assessment.

AB Purpose: We sought to delineate highly visible publications related to sepsis. Within these subsets, elements of altmetrics performance, including mentions on Twitter, and the correlation between altmetrics and conventional citation counts were ascertained.
   Materials and Methods: Three subsets of sepsis publications from 2012 to 2017 were synthesized by the overall Altmetric.com attention score, number of mentions by unique Twitter users, and conventional citation counts. For these subsets, geolocated Twitter activity was plotted on a choropleth, the lag between publication date and altmetrics mentions was characterized, and correlations were examined between altmetrics performance and normalized conventional citation counts.
   Results: Of 57,152 PubMed query results, Altmetric.com data was available for 28,344 (49.6%). The top 50 publications by Altmetric.com attention score and Twitter attention represented a mix of original research and other types of work, garnering attention from Twitter users in 143 countries that was highly contemporaneous with publication. Altmetrics performance and conventional citation counts were poorly correlated.
   Conclusions: While unreliable to gauge impact or future citation potential, altmetrics may be valuable for parties who wish to detect and drive public awareness of research findings and may enable researchers to dynamically explore the reach of their work in novel dimensions.

TI A bibliometric method for assessing technological maturity: the case of

AB While novel technologies have tremendous competitive potential, they also involve certain risks. Maturity assessment analyzes how well a technological development can fulfill an expected task. The technology readiness level (TRL) has been considered to be one of the most promising approaches for addressing technological maturity. Nonetheless, its assessment requires opinions of the experts, which is costly and implies the risk of personal bias. To fill this gap, this paper presents a Bibliometric Method for Assessing Technological Maturity (BIMATEM). It is a repeatable framework that assesses maturity quantitatively. Our method is based on the assumption that each technology life cycle stage can be matched to technology records contained in scientific literature, patents, and news databases. The scientific papers and patent records of mature technologies display a logistic growth behavior, while news records follow a hype-type behavior. BIMATEM determines the maturity level by curve fitting technology records to these behaviors. To test our approach, BIMATEM was applied to additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. Our results revealed that material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion and vat photopolymerization are the most mature AM technologies with TRL between 6 and 7, followed by directed energy deposition with TRL between 4 and 5, and binder jetting and sheet lamination, the least mature, with TRL between 1 and 2. BIMATEM can be used by competitive technologyintelligence professionals, policymakers, and further decision makers whose main interests include assessing the risk of implementing new technologies. Future research can focus on testing the method with regard to altmetrics.

DT Article
DE Bibliometrics; Altmetrics; Leonardo da Vinci; Intellectual leadership
AB The article evaluates the body of literature on Leonardo da Vinci using for the first time bibliometric and altmetric methods for data processing. The question of whether the literature on Leonardo da Vinci reflects his interdisciplinarity as scientist and artist is addressed. We argue that the medical and material sciences show a high number of citations to the respective publications, and much higher number of citations to publications ratio than the humanities and social sciences fields. We also found that there is no relationship between the number of publications for each research area and the citations (between productivity and quality). The largest category of papers, in terms of citations and in terms of the number of subfields, discussing da Vinci's contribution to the various sciences, belongs to exact sciences. This finding is surprising as Leonardo da Vinci has become a synonym for the mysterious artist whose paintings consist of many messages that are difficult to explain. Therefore it seems natural that Leonardo the artist would get a lot of research attention. Nevertheless, the bibliometric findings show that the academic community has interest in his contributions to science, no less than in his work of art.

AB Objective: Journals use social media to increase the awareness of their publications. Infographics show research findings in a concise and visually appealing manner, well suited for dissemination on social media platforms. We hypothesized that infographic abstracts promoted on social media would increase the dissemination and online readership of the parent research articles.
   Methods: Twenty-four articles were chosen from the six issues of CJEM published between July 2016 and June 2017 and randomized to infographic or control groups. All articles were disseminated through the journal's social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook). Control articles were promoted using a screen capture image of each article's abstract on the journal's social media accounts. Infographic articles were promoted similarly using a visual infographic. Infographics were also published and promoted on the CanadiEM. org's website and social media channels. Abstract views, full-text views, and the change in Altmetric score were compared between groups using unpaired two-tailed t-tests.
   Results: There were no significant differences in the groups at baseline. Abstract views (mean, 95% CI) were higher in the infographics (379, 287-471) than the control group (176, 136-215, p<0.001). Mean change in Altmetric scores was higher in the infographics (26, 18-34) than in the control group (3, 2-4, p<0.0001). There was no difference in full-text views between the infographics (50, 0-101) and control groups (25, 18-32).
   Conclusion: The promotion of CJEM articles using infographics on social media and the CanadiEM. org website increased Altmetric scores and abstract views. Infographics may have a role in increasing awareness of medical literature.

AB There are known gender imbalances in participation in scientific fields, from female dominance of nursing to male dominance of mathematics. It is not clear whether there is also a citation imbalance, with some claiming that male-authored research tends to be more cited. No previous study has assessed gender differences in the readers of academic research on a large scale, however. In response, this article assesses whether there are gender differences in the average citations and/or Mendeley readers of academic publications. Field normalised logged Scopus citations and Mendeley readers from mid-2018 for articles published in 2014 were investigated for articles with first authors from India, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the USA in up to 251 fields with at least 50 male and female authors. Although female-authored research is less cited in Turkey (-4.0%) and India (-3.6%), it is marginally more cited in Spain (0.4%), the UK (0.4%), and the USA (0.2%). Female-authored research has fewer Mendeley readers in India (-1.1%) but more in Spain (1.4%), Turkey (1.1%), the UK (2.7%) and the USA (3.0%). Thus, whilst there may be little practical gender difference in citation impact in countries with mature science systems, the higher female readership impact suggests a wider audience for female-authored research. The results also show that the conclusions from a gender analysis depend on the field normalisation method. A theoretically informed decision must therefore be made about which normalisation to use. The results also suggest that arithmetic mean-based field normalisation is favourable to males. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We harvested tweets from October 2011 to November 2015 that contained one or more JoVE links. These tweets citing JoVE articles were analyzed both statistically and qualitatively. In this paper, we present the distribution of these tweets, with a closer look at the affordance use of Twitter including hashtags and mentions. In addition, we conducted a content analysis of the sampled Twitter accounts and tweets. We present the coding schemes and results of both Twitter user accounts and tweets text. In addition to the analysis of the coding results, we discuss the content of the tweets with particular attention to issues including the video/visual feature mentioned, the role of Twitter bots, and self-promotion of different stakeholders in the Twitter communication of JoVE video publications.

ID TWITTER; EDUCATION; CITATIONS; MEDICINE; TWEETS
AB BACKGROUND: Twitter-based journal clubs are intended to connect clinicians, educators, and researchers to discuss recent research and aid in dissemination of results. The Journal of Hospital Medicine (JHM) began producing a Twitter-based journal club, #JHMChat, in 2015.
   OBJECTIVE: To describe the implementation and assess the impact of a journal-sponsored, Twitter-based journal club on Twitter and journal metrics.
   INTERVENTION: Each #JHMChat focused on a recently published JHM article, was moderated by a social media editor, and included one study author or guest.
   MEASUREMENTS: The total number of participants, tweets, tweets/participant, impressions, page views, and change in the Altmetric score were assessed after each session. Thematic analysis of each article was conducted, and post-chat surveys of participating authors and participant responses to continuing medical education surveys were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Seventeen Twitter-based chats were held: seven (47%) focused on value, six (40%) targeted clinical issues, and four (27%) focused on education. On average, we found 2.17 (+/- 0.583 SD) million impressions/session, 499 (+/- 129 SD) total tweets/session, and 73 (+/- 24 SD) participants/session. Value-based care articles had the greatest number of impressions (2.61 +/- 0.55 million) and participants (90 +/- 12). The mean increase in the Altmetric score was 14 points (+/- 12), with medical education-themed articles garnering the greatest change (mean increase of 32). Page views were noted to have increased similarly to levels of electronic Table of Content releases. Authors and participants believed #JHMChat was a valuable experience and rated it highly on post-chat evaluations.
   CONCLUSION: Online journal clubs appear to increase awareness and uptake of journal article results and are considered a useful tool by participants. (C) 2018 Society of Hospital Medicine

At the scientific level, its importance is perceived in the support of different international funding agencies to finance research on this subject. In order to analyse the characteristics and impact of these initiatives, this paper examines the European projects into the Seventh Framework Programme on Energy Saving. Using a bibliometric methodology, the flow of scientific information from these projects to scientific publications is analyzed. Finally, in order to know the social repercussions of these research, the impact of the projects and publications on social media has been considered. Methodologically, a multiple linear regression model was developed to relate the variables from each information source and to detect the ones that contribute to the social media impact of scientific publications. The results show that the research activities in Energy Saving are concentrated in Germany, France, United Kingdom and Spain. In general, the main partners are companies and public research centers and no link has been found between the funding received and the size of the research consortia. As for the model developed, it has been found that the journal, documental type and international collaboration are the most significant factors for the impact of research in social media.

ID OPEN ACCESS
AB Climate change research aims to understand global environmental change and how it will impact nature and society. The broad scope of climate change impacts means that successful adaptation and mitigation efforts will require an unprecedented collaboration effort that unites diverse disciplines and is able to rapidly respond to evolving climate issues (IPCC, 2014). However, to achieve this aim, climate change research practices need updating: key research findings remain behind journal paywalls, and scientific progress can be impeded by low levels of reproducibility and transparency (Ellison, 2010; Morueta-Holme et al., 2018), individual data ownership (Hampton et al., 2015), and inefficient research workflows (Lowndes et al., 2017). Furthermore, the level of public interest and policy engagement on climate change issues relies on fast communication of academic research to public institutions, with the result that the societal impact of climate change studies will differ according to their public availability and exposure. Here, we argue that by adopting open science (OS) principles, scientists can advance climate change research and accelerate efforts to mitigate impacts; especially for highly vulnerable developing regions of the world where research capacity is limited. We underscore the specific benefits of OS in raising the academic and societal impact of climate change research using citation and media metrics.

In total, 149 suggestions were made by 42 respondents, mainly UK librarians. Responses could be categorized into four main themes: A) Improve and share your data; B) Be more responsible; C) Improve your tools; D) Improve your indicators. The findings of the survey are discussed and sample comments shared. Based on these findings, and expanding on the four themes, the article makes a number of practical recommendations to metrics suppliers for ways in which their services could better serve the need of the community for robust and responsible bibliometric and altmetric evaluation.

AB This study assesses possible advantages of open access can bring to the area of Information Science, using bibliometric citation indicators and Altmetric scores to analyze sixteen hybrid scientific journals, filtered by respective Impact Factors and included in the Journal Citation Reports. Data collection was performed using Web of Science, Google Scholar, Altmetric.com and Mendeley. The verification was performed in two periods in order to examine whether open access exerted influence over time. Results indicate that open access boost the number of citations and mentions in social media for the sample of papers drawn from journals under study. Moreover, this boost is greater when authors upon publishing pay the processing charge to guarantee the immediate open access availability of the paper. In conclusion, while open access can boost the number of citations of a paper, the quality of the paper itself drives most citations.

AB This paper aims for a better understanding of the perspectives of contributors to Spanish academic journals regarding open access, open peer review, and altmetrics. Specifically, it explores how age, gender, years of professional experience, and perception and use of social media influence authors' opinions of these developments in scholarly publishing. A sample of 295 contributors to Spanish academic journals participated in a survey about the aforementioned topics. They were found to hold a favourable opinion of open access but were more cautious about open peer review and altmetrics. The responses of younger and female scholars indicated more reluctance to accept open peer review practices. A positive attitude toward social networks did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for emerging trends in scholarly publishing. Despite this, ResearchGate users were more aware of altmetrics.

AB The scientific journal is an important part of scholarly communication and for a long time it has functioned both as the sole dissemination channel of research findings and as an important indicator of research quality. Recently altmetrics have been investigated for their applicability for research assessment. The potential of and hope attached to altmetrics is that they could function as complements to more traditional metrics and possibly reflect some aspects of new forms of online scholarly communication. This research will investigate aggregation of altmetrics at journal-level and the online presence and visibility of selected Korea-based journals. Based on our findings we can conclude that Open Access availability is a clear driver for higher online attention for Korean scientific journals, however, this attention is also heavily influenced by the popularity of a few articles that have attracted significant online attention. Because of the influence some popular articles can have on the aggregated journal-level attention, journal-level altmetrics do not appear to be reliable nor useful indicators of the performance of scientific journals.

AB As Mendeley readership counts seems to be the most closely related to citation counts in comparison to other altmetrics, this paper proposes the h(men) index as a variant of the citation-based h index which takes into account Mendeley readership counts. For 29 authors-11 of which are considered as young and 18 as established authors-the h values for Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) and the h(men) value for Mendeley have been derived. In order to find out about the reliability of the h(men) index as an indicator to assess scholarly impact, a correlation analysis between the indices has been conducted. Furthermore, the index values were divided by the scientific ages of the authors in order to obtain time-oriented h and h(men) values which make a comparison of authors with different scientific ages possible. The h(men) index was found to have very strong positive and highly significant correlations of around 0.95 with each of the h indices. Time-oriented values showed the faster reception of scientific work via Mendeley in comparison to citation counts and revealed exceptional authors who were found to have rather young scientific ages.

AB The reliable assessment of individual faculty members' contributions is a key challenge in the governance of research institutions. Traditionally, scientific impact is estimated based on bibliographic analyses. With online platforms, particularly social media, gaining popularity among academics, new opportunities for the analysis of scientific impact arise. Proponents of the altmetrics approach hold that both general purpose social media and services tailored to the scientific community allow for a range of usage metrics that may inform scientific impact assessment. We propose that relational analyses of social media platforms may shed new light on these understudied dimensions of scientific impact and may enrich assessment efforts. Based on a sample of Swiss management scholars' active on ResearchGate, we conduct a social network analysis, derive relational metrics, and correlate these metrics with bibliometrics, webometrics, and altmetrics to gauge their potential to inform scientific impact assessment, specifically in business and management research.

AB Altmetrics is an emerging topic that has generated much interest. Most of the studies, however, have focused on the comparison of altemetric indicators with traditional citation metrics and few have explored the factors influencing altmetric performance. This study investigates the dissemination pattern of scientific articles on social medial, and is particularly focused on highly tweeted articles and highly cited articles. Based on bibliometric and altmetric data collected for over 40,000 articles in the field of biology, we found that the timing of tweets and the type of Twitter accounts affect the amount of attention that a scientific publication receives on social media. Articles with a large number of tweets tend to be the ones receiving immediate social media exposure and are often tweeted by journal associated organization accounts or other individual accounts with a large number of followers. By contrast, highly cited articles in general are neither tweeted timely nor promoted by their respective journal accounts.

AB The results of an empirical pilot project focused on the association between classical bibliometricspublication, citation index, and journal cited half-lifeand an altmetricthe assessment of an article's impactare discussed. The analysis included an array of 37200 domestic articles indexed in SCI-E in 2015. Two altmetrics are used: usage counts for the last 180 days, U1, and usage counts since February 1, 2013, U2. A significant Kendall rank correlation has been identified between citation indices and article-level metrics. A stronger correlation has been observed for long usage counts, U2. The relationship between usage metrics and traditional journal-level metrics (cited half-life) has been analyzed. A rather weak negative correlation between cited half-life and U1 (U2) has been revealed, which is described by an inverse logarithmic dependence. In the authors' opinion, altmetrics should not be opposed to classical bibliometrics; they should be used as additional metrics to assess an article's impact.

AB Introduction: Today, the dissemination methods of scientific publications and Web access ways to them have changed. It is essential to use the new altmetric measurements to assess the impact of research products in addition to traditional indicators. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the correlation between the number of citations of Iranian scholars' articles indexed in WoS and their readership rate in the two social networks of Mendeley and RG. Methods: The quantitative methods used in this analytical-descriptive survey such as the scientometric / altmetric and correlation study. The statistical population consisted of scientific articles by the Iranian scholars in WoS. The sample of the research was 165 retrieved articles with 200 citations or more, in WoS with the address "Iran". Data was collected from WoS. Mendeley and RG and analyzed by using Excel and SPSS software. Findings: The findings showed that the correlation between the number of citations of the articles and the degree of readership in Mendeley was 0.352 based on the Spearman's correlation coefficient. The correlation between the number of citations of the articles and the rate of readership in RG was 0.177. The findings indicated a positive and moderate correlation with a confidence level of 99% for Mendeley and a positive, but poor correlation for RG with 95% confidence. There was a significant correlation between the readability of articles in two Mendeley and RG based on Spearman coefficient (correlation of 0.382 at 0.01 significance level) with a positive and average correlation. Conclusion: It was concluded that altmetric can be used as a complementary indicator beside traditional indices. Mendeley is an appropriate tool to evaluate the research work of scholars, universities and institutes and countries. OriginalityNalue: For the first time, correlation is measured between the articles' citations in Web of Science (WoS) and the readership rate in Mendeley and ResearchGate (RG). The results of this research clear the value of academic social networks in the dissemination of scientific productions. These networks can increase the use of authentic scientific works. The results of this study encourage scientists to share their scientific productions on these networks.

ID CITATION INDEXES; SCIENCE; DOCUMENTATION; ASSOCIATION; DIMENSION; WEB
AB Bibliometrics are a range of techniques and quantitative measures that provide an analysis of written publications such as books and articles, and which assess the impact of research outputs. They are commonly applied to individual authors in the form of citation metrics but can also be used to assess the influence of research groups or even entire institutions. With the increased importance of social media as a means of communicating and publicising research findings, additional alternative measures of impact (altmetrics) are now being used. In addition to analysing the reach of a research output, bibliometrics can also be used as search tools to identify related and updated research, author networks and connections between institutions. This review summarises the range of tools and services that are available, their advantages and disadvantages, and some of the challenges and issues presented by the existence of multiple digital versions of research outputs.

AB Social media are considered perfect examples of Web 2.0 applications, which people use to communicate and collaborate together. Baidu Baike, a wiki-like online encyclopedia, is analysed as a typical example in which experts and lay Internet users collaborate. Entries in Biomedical Science section are analysed to reveal communication activities behind the construction of such scholarly entries. The composition of the related entries, references of each entry, cooperation among contributors of entries, and common interests of contributors are analysed with Altmetrics, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and heterogeneous coupling. Altmetrics is used to analyse scholarly communication during the construction of entries. Citation analysis based on references in entries provides a way to establish indirect communication between citing and cited authors, namely the contributors of entries and authors of references. Co-occurrence analysis is used for the analysis of cooperation both among experts and lay Internet users and the distribution of tags of entries. Heterogeneous coupling is used to reveal the relationship among entries based on common references as well as common experts. The results show that literature is referred to during people's online communication. The citations and tags of entries reflect the interdisciplinary specializations within Biomedical Science. The majority of experts cooperated with someone in the same affiliation but cross-unit cooperation also existed. The common interests of experts indicate that the specialists only master their own field. Moreover, as a typical general public, lay Internet users have a wide range of interests and remain enthusiastic about entry contribution.

AB There are three main reasons for retraction: (1) ethical misconduct (e.g. duplicate publication, plagiarism, missing credit, no IRB, ownership issues, authorship issues, interference in the review process, citation manipulation); (2) scientific distortion (e.g. data manipulation, fraudulent data, unsupported conclusions, questionable data validity, non-replicability, data errors-even if unintended); (3) administrative error (e.g. article published in wrong issue, not the final version published, publisher errors). The first category, although highly deplorable has almost no effect on the advancement of science, the third category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the second category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view, as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication, years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and social media attention by the three major categories. The data set comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from Elsevier's ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were retrieved four times within 4 years, which allowed us to examine post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for Mendeley reader counts. The major findings are that both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the relationship among abstract structure, readability, and completeness, and how these features may influence social media activity and bibliometric results, considering systematic reviews (SRs) about interventions in psoriasis classified by methodological quality.
   Study Design and Setting: Systematic literature searches about psoriasis interventions were undertaken on relevant databases. For each review, methodological quality was evaluated using the assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews tool. Abstract extension, structure, readability, and quality and completeness of reporting were analyzed. Social media activity, which consider Twitter and Facebook mention counts, as well as Mendeley readers and Google scholar citations were obtained for each article. Analyses were conducted to describe any potential influence of abstract characteristics on review's social media diffusion.
   Results: We classified 139 intervention SRs as displaying high/moderate/low methodological quality. We observed that abstract readability of SRs has been maintained high for last 20 years, although there are some differences based on their methodological quality. Free format abstracts were most sensitive to the increase of text readability as compared with more structured abstracts (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion or eight headings), yielding opposite effects on their quality and completeness depending on the methodological quality: a worsening in low quality reviews and an improvement in those of high quality. Both readability indices and preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses for Abstract total scores showed an inverse relationship with social media activity and bibliometric results in high methodological quality reviews but not in those of lower quality.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that increasing abstract readability must be specially considered when writing free format summaries of high-quality reviews because this fact correlates with an improvement of their completeness and quality, and this may help to achieve broader social media visibility and article usage.

AB The aim of this study is to measure differences between three relevant altmetric providers: Altmetric.com, PlumX and Crossref Event Data (CED). More than 67,000 research papers, initially extracted from PlumX, were searched in Altmetric.com and CED to compare their counts. Differences between services were analyzed regarding the number of documents with an altmetric event and the counting differences in each metric. Results show that Altmetric.com is the provider with the best coverage of blog posts, news and tweets; while PlumX better collects Mendeley readers; and CED is the site that extracts more Wikipedia citations. The study concludes that there are important counting differences due to technical errors and extracting criteria. The article recommends the use of specific services for the analysis of particular metrics. While, it should be mandatory to employ the combination of several providers, if we want to perform an overall analysis.

AB Bibliometric and Altmetric analyses highlight key publications, which have been considered to be the most influential in their field. The hypothesis was that highly cited articles would correlate positively with levels of evidence and Altmetric scores (AS) and rank.
   Surgery as a search term was entered into Thomson Reuter's Web of Science database to identify all English-language full articles. The 100 most cited articles were analysed by topic, journal, author, year, institution, and AS.
   By bibliometric criteria, eligible articles numbered 286,122 and the median (range) citation number was 574 (446-5746). The most cited article (Dindo et al.) classified surgical complications by severity score (5746 citations). Annals of Surgery published most articles and received most citations (26,457). The country and year with most publications were the USA (n = 50) and 1999 (n = 11). By Altmetric criteria, the article with the highest AS was by Bigelow et al. (AS = 53, hypothermia's role in cardiac surgery); Annals of Surgery published most articles, and the country and year with most publications were USA (n = 4) and 2007 (n = 3). Level-1-evidence articles numbered 13, but no correlation was found between evidence level and citation number (SCC 0.094, p = 0.352) or AS (SCC = 0.149, p = 0.244). Median AS was 0 (0-53), and in articles published after the year 2000, AS was associated with citation number (r = 0.461, p = 0.001) and citation rate index (r = 0.455, p = 0.002). AS was not associated with journal impact factor (r = 0.160, p = 0.118).
   Bibliometric and Altmetric analyses provide important but different perspectives regarding article impact, which are unrelated to evidence level.

TI Social impact in social media: A new method to evaluate the social
   impact of research
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID SCIENCE
AB The social impact of research has usually been analysed through the scientific outcomes produced under the auspices of the research. The growth of scholarly content in social media and the use of altmetrics by researchers to track their work facilitate the advancement in evaluating the impact of research. However, there is a gap in the identification of evidence of the social impact in terms of what citizens are sharing on their social media platforms. This article applies a social impact in social media methodology (SISM) to identify quantitative and qualitative evidence of the potential or real social impact of research shared on social media, specifically on Twitter and Facebook. We define the social impact coverage ratio (SICOR) to identify the percentage of tweets and Facebook posts providing information about potential or actual social impact in relation to the total amount of social media data found related to specific research projects. We selected 10 projects in different fields of knowledge to calculate the SICOR, and the results indicate that 0.43% of the tweets and Facebook posts collected provide linkages with information about social impact. However, our analysis indicates that some projects have a high percentage (4.98%) and others have no evidence of social impact shared in social media. Examples of quantitative and qualitative evidence of social impact are provided to illustrate these results. A general finding is that novel evidences of social impact of research can be found in social media, becoming relevant platforms for scientists to spread quantitative and qualitative evidence of social impact in social media to capture the interest of citizens. Thus, social media users are showed to be intermediaries making visible and assessing evidence of social impact.

AB The main objective of this study is to describe the life cycle of altmetric and bibliometric indicators in a sample of publications. Altmetrics (Downloads, Views, Readers, Tweets, and Blog mentions) and bibliometric counts (Citations) (in this study, the indicators will be capitalized to differentiate them from the general language) of 5185 publications (19,186 observations) were extracted from PlumX to observe their distribution according to the publication age. Correlations between these metrics were calculated from month to month to observe the evolution of these relationships. The results showed that mention metrics (Tweets and Blog mentions) are the earliest metrics that become available most quickly and have the shortest life cycle. Next, Readers are the metrics with the highest prevalence and with the second fastest growth. Views and Downloads show a continuous growth, being the indicators with the longest life cycles. Finally, Citations are the slowest indicators and have a low prevalence. Correlations show a strong relationship between mention metrics and Readers and Downloads, and between Readers and Citations. These results enable us to create a schematic diagram of the relationships between these metrics from a longitudinal view. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Language distribution in scientific communication reflects the influence of different languages on science in global perspective. The study, based on over 450 thousand scientific tweets of all publications indexed by Scopus in June 2015, reveals the language distribution in informal scientific communication. Moreover, this result is compared with the language distribution in formal scientific communication reflected in scientific publications. Results show: (1) The language of scientific tweets is concentrated in English (91%), Japanese (2.4%) and Spanish (1.7%), while the language of scientific publications is concentrated in English (90.6%), Chinese (5%) and German (1.1%). (2) Both scientific tweets and scientific publications present disciplinary differences in language distribution, reflecting the different amount of attention that authors of different languages have on certain disciplines. (3) Except Saudi Arabia, investigated countries all over the world, regardless of whether their native language is English or not, all have English scientific tweets in the dominant position. For the vast majority of these countries, the native language scientific tweets only rank the second position. (4) Overall, 26% of tweeters use more than one language to tweet scientific products, while 49% of scientific tweeters tweet everything in English only. The results indicate that English has undoubtedly become the lingua franca in informal scientific communication. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While ResearchGate has become the most popular academic social networking site in terms of regular users, not all institutions have joined and the scores it assigns to academics and institutions are controversial. This paper assesses the presence in ResearchGate of higher education institutions in Europe and the US in 2017, and the extent to which institutional ResearchGate Scores reflect institutional academic impact. Most of the 2258 European and 4355 US higher educational institutions included in the sample had an institutional ResearchGate profile, with near universal coverage for PhD-awarding institutions found in the Web of Science (WoS). For non-PhD awarding institutions that did not publish, size (number of staff members) was most associated with presence in ResearchGate. For PhD awarding institutions in WoS, presence in RG was strongly related to the number of WoS publications. In conclusion, a) institutional RG scores reflect research volume more than visibility and b) this indicator is highly correlated to the number of WoS publications. Hence, the value of RG Scores for institutional comparisons is limited. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, two new indicators (Equalized Mean-based Normalized Proportion Cited, EMNPC; Mean-based Normalized Proportion Cited, MNPC) were proposed which are intended for sparse scientometrics data, e.g., alternative metrics (altmetrics). The indicators compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g. on Facebook) of a unit (e.g., a researcher or institution) with the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields and publication years (the expected values). In this study, we propose a third indicator (Mantel-Haenszel quotient, MHq) belonging to the same indicator family. The MHq is based on the MH analysis - an established method in statistics for the comparison of proportions. We test (using citations and assessments by peers, i.e. F1000Prime recommendations) if the three indicators can distinguish between different quality levels as defined on the basis of the assessments by peers. Thus, we test their convergent validity. We find that the indicator MHq is able to distinguish between the quality levels in most cases while MNPC and EMNPC are not. Since the MHq is shown in this study to be a valid indicator, we apply it to six types of zero-inflated altmetrics data and test whether different altmetrics sources are related to quality. The results for the various altmetrics demonstrate that the relationship between altmetrics (Wikipedia, Facebook, blogs, and news data) and assessments by peers is not as strong as the relationship between citations and assessments by peers. Actually, the relationship between citations and peer assessments is about two to three times stronger than the association between altmetrics and assessments by peers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Counts of tweets and Mendeley user libraries have been proposed as altmetric alternatives to citation counts for the impact assessment of articles. Although both have been investigated to discover whether they correlate with article citations, it is not known whether users tend to tweet or save (in Mendeley) the same kinds of articles that they cite. In response, this article compares pairs of articles that are tweeted, saved to a Mendeley library, or cited by the same user, but possibly a different user for each source. The study analyzes 1,131,318 articles published in 2012, with minimum tweeted (10), saved to Mendeley (100), and cited (10) thresholds. The results show surprisingly minor overall overlaps between the three phenomena. The importance of journals for Twitter and the presence of many bots at different levels of activity suggest that this site has little value for impact altmetrics. The moderate differences between patterns of saving and citation suggest that Mendeley can be used for some types of impact assessments, but sensitivity is needed for underlying differences.

TI Social Media and the Dissemination of Research: Insights from the Most
   Widely Circulated Articles in Plastic Surgery
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The purpose of this study is to quantify the relationship between social media use and the dissemination of research across nontraditional channels.
   Methods: Between June and August of 2016, the authors identified 10 plastic surgery journals with the highest impact factor and their 10 most widely circulated articles. Article age; journal impact factor; "distinguished" article designation; and social media metadata of the first authors, last authors, and journals were incorporated into a multivariate regression model to predict the Altmetric Attention Score, a quantitative measure of popularity across Web-based media platforms.
   Results: A total of 100 articles, 181 authors, and 10 journals were identified. Older articles tended to be less popular. The article's popularity was associated with the journal's audience size, but not with the author's social media activity. For each 1000 additional Twitter followers of the journal of publication, the Altmetric score is greater by a factor of 1.72 (95 percent CI, 1.076 to 2.749), which is the equivalent of 72 percent more Tweets. There is also a small but statistically significant negative association between the author's social media audience size and the popularity of his or her articles: for every 1000 additional followers, the Altmetric score is lower by a factor of 0.822 (95 percent CI, 0.725 to 0.932), which is the equivalent of 17.8 percent fewer Tweets.
   Conclusion: The popularity of an article across social media platforms is associated with the journal's audience on social media, not with the magnitude of the author's social media activity.

Morgan and Claypool, London, 2017b) proposed a new family of field- and time-normalized indicators, which is intended for sparse data. These indicators are based on units of analysis (e.g., institutions) rather than on the paper level. They compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g., on Twitter) of a unit with the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields and publication years. We propose a new indicator (Mantel-Haenszel quotient, MHq) for the indicator family. The MHq is rooted in the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) analysis. This analysis is an established method, which can be used to pool the data from several 2 x 2 cross tables based on different subgroups. We investigate using citations and assessments by peers whether the indicator family can distinguish between quality levels defined by the assessments of peers. Thus, we test the convergent validity. We find that the MHq is able to distinguish between quality levels in most cases while other indicators of the family are not. Since our study approves the MHq as a convergent valid indicator, we apply the MHq to four different Twitter groups as defined by the company Altmetric. Our results show that there is a weak relationship between the Twitter counts of all four Twitter groups and scientific quality, much weaker than between citations and scientific quality. Therefore, our results discourage the use of Twitter counts in research evaluation.

AB The development of scientometric indicators and methods for evaluative purposes, requires a multitude of assumptions, conventions, limitations, and caveats. Given this, we cannot permit ambiguities in the key concepts forming the basis of scientometric science itself, or research assessment exercises would rest on quicksand. This conceptual work attempts to spell out some principles leading to a clear definition of "impact" of research, and above all, of the appropriate scientometric indicator to measure it. The aim is to stimulate a discussion aimed at a definitive convergence on the meaning and measurement of a fundamental concept of the scientometric science. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

ID MEDICAL-EDUCATION; OPEN ACCESS; IMPACT; CITATIONS; QUALITY; BLOGS
AB Researchers, funders, and institutions are interested in understanding and quantifying research dissemination and impact, particularly related to communicating with the public. Traditionally, citations have been a primary impact measure; however, citations can be slow to accrue and focus on academic use. Recently altmetrics, which track alternate dissemination forms (e.aEuro<overline>g., social media), have been suggested as a complement to citation-based metrics. This study examines the relationship between altmetrics and traditional measures: journal article citations and access counts.
   The researchers queried Web of Science and Altmetric Explorer for articles published in HPE journals between 2013-2015. They identified 2,486 articles with altmetrics. Data were analyzed using negative binomial and linear regression models.
   Blogging was associated with the greatest increase in citations (13% increase), whereas Tweets (1.2%) and Mendeley (1%) were associated with smaller increases. Journal impact factor (JIF) was associated with a 21% increase in citations. Publicly accessible articles were associated with a 19% decrease, but the interactive effect between accessible articles and JIF was associated with a 12% increase. When examining access counts, publicly accessible articles had an increase of 170 access counts whereas blogging was associated with a decrease of 87 accesses.
   This study suggests that several altmetrics outlets are positively associated with citations, and that public accessibility, holding all other independent variables constant, is positively related to article access. Given the scientific community's evolving focus on dissemination these findings have implications for stakeholders, providing insight into the factors that may improve citations and access of articles.

AB Purpose: We aimed to assess the impact of open access (OA) versus paywalled access (PA) publication on Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and whether AAS correlates with future citation count access in the context of intensive care medicine (ICM) and anesthesia.
   Methods: 1854 and 2935 publications, in the year 2015, were identified in ICM and anesthesia respectively, using a Pubmed search. The mean AAS was measured for each article.
   Results: More ICM articles were OA, compared to of anesthesia articles (38.9% v 35.0% p=0.02). The mean AAS for OA ICM publications was significantly higher than that of PA ICM publications (17.34 vs 8.45, p < 0.01), however, this was not observed when examined in a fixed follow up time frame. AAS appear to correlate with future citation counts.
   Conclusions: ICM publications that are available as OA in the medium term result in higher AAS when compared to PA publications, this phenomenon was not observed in anesthesia. AAS correlate with future citation counts, however, a larger study is required to confirm this. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim To analyse the Altmetric data of all dental literature and to find the most important and effective Altmetric factors. Method PubMed was searched to find all types of dental articles. To discover the most important and effective Altmetric factors in contemporary dental literature, multi-layered perceptron artificial neural network was used. Results A total of 582,227 PubMed records were found. The mean Altmetric scores were 3.7 +/- 18, 4.1 +/- 16 and 3.2 +/- 14 for clinical trials, reviews and free full-text articles, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that news outlets, tweeters and scientific bloggers were the most important and influential Altmetric data resources. Among 150 analysed dental journals the British Dental Journal acquired the first rank. Twitter was the most popular Altmetric resource among dental journals. Conclusion Dental researchers, journal editors, publishers and research funders should pay more attention to Altmetrics as a newly-emerging scholarly tool measuring the social impact of research findings.

ID WEBOMETRICS; ALTMETRICS; TWEETS; MEDIA
AB Altmetric indicators are increasingly present in the research landscape. Among this ecosystem of heterogeneous indicators, social reference managers have been proposed as indicators of broader use of scholarly work. However, little work has been done to understand the data underlying this indicator. The present work uses a large-scale survey to study the users of two prominent social reference managers-Mendeley and Zotero. The survey examines demographic characteristics, usage of the platforms, as well as attitudes towards key issues in scholarly communication, such as open access, peer review, privacy, and the reward system of science. Results show strong differences between platforms: Mendeley users are younger and more gender-balanced; Zotero users are more engaged in social media and more likely to come from the social sciences and humanities. Zotero users are more likely to use the platform's search functions and to organize their libraries, while Mendeley users are more likely to take advantage of some of the discovery and networking features-such as browsing papers and groups and connecting with other users. We discuss the implications of using metrics derived from these platforms as impact indicators.

AB Objective. To describe evidences of certain bibliographic issues and their influence on altmetrics and bibliometrics indicators, considering a set of Brazilian, Spanish and Portuguese articles.
   Design/Methodology/Approach. From an exploratory approach, a total of 133 articles, available in ScienceOpen and best-positioned from the altmetrics counts, have been analyzed according to characteristics as publication date, authorship and collaboration, subject area, language, number of citations and, finally, altmetrics values derived from altmetric attention scores and mentions collected by Altmetric.
   Results/Discussion. Data show differences among countries regarding some issues - for example, number of authors by article, or language of publication-for the best-positioned articles in altmetrics rankings. For the whole sample, it is remarkable that more recent articles obtain more mentions and shared authorship is usual.
   Conclusions. Altmetrics evaluate visibility and reception of academic articles in web and social media, so they enrich citation data and extend the scope of the scientific production beyond the academic community. It is required to study and understand the social impact of science and to identify which elements of the publication process have direct influences over the popularization of scientific research.
   Originality/Value. Besides of dealing with a sample of Ibero-american articles, usually underrepresented in bibliometric databases, this study emphasizes the complementary role of the different dimensions that have to be taken into account in scientific communication.

AB The purpose of this article is twofold: a) to describe and compare methods of early career researcher (ECR) assessment/appraisal; b) to explain how ECRs build, showcase, and monitor their reputation in an era of novel developments in scholarly communications. In all, 116 ECRs from China, France, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the US were questioned about appraisal and reputation in structured in-depth interviews. Desk research supplemented the interview data. It was found that ECRs are assessed very traditionally, largely on journal papers, and cannot (although some would like to) see this state of affairs changing. Mainly, they would prefer that less weight be given to the volume of papers published and more weight given to the quality of their research and its impact on the body of knowledge in their field. Unavoidably, then, ECRs' efforts to build, showcase, and monitor their reputation are still very much associated with research achievements. Nevertheless, online scholarly communities, and ResearchGate in particular, are gaining ground among ECRs, with increase in visibility and citations, and therefore a maximization of research impact, considered to be their main reputational benefits. Metrics are regarded as a rule of the game' that has to be accepted, although ECRs have minimal interest in altmetrics.

AB Recent altmetrics research has started to investigate the meaning of altmetrics and whether altmetrics could reveal something about the attention or impact connected to research. This research continues this line of investigations and studies reasons for why some research has received significant online attention in one or both of two social media services; Twitter or Mendeley. This research investigated Finnish researchers' opinions about the reasons for why their research had received significant online attention and if the attention received could reflect scientific or societal impact of their research. Furthermore it was studied whether the authors of the papers with significant online attention actively followed how their papers were shared or discussed online and if the authors thought that the online attention increased either the scientific or societal impact of their work. Based on the findings it can be stated that the level of online attention received is a sum of many factors and that there are also specific differences between the platforms where the attention has been received. For the articles that had received significant attention on Mendeley the reasons for that attention were more often seen as due to an academic audience, while the situation was reverse on Twitter, with the majority of reasons for the attention being linked to a wider audience. Similar trend could be seen when asked about whether the online attention could reflect scientific or societal impact, although a clear consensus about whether online attention could reflect any type of impact at all could not be reached.

AB This paper explores the possibility of extracting scientometric data from social media. Basic approaches to typification and classification of altmetrics are presented. The advantages and disadvantages of using altmetrics as scientometric indicators are investigated. The concept of webification of bibliometric indicators is introduced. Several examples of webometric indicators are discussed. Webometric indicators are designed to evaluate academic performance of researchers. A new criterion is introduced for the use in the performance-based ranking of researchers. This criterion applies webometric indicators that are calculated on the basis of altmetrics.

AB Social media has provided new opportunities for both female and male academics to disseminate their research results, and presence on the Internet is found to increase the visibility of scholars. Thus, this study examined whether there were differences in terms of scientific productivity or the visibility (both in terms of citations and social media metrics) of female and male scholars in the field of neurosurgery. To do this, 11,127 articles and reviews from 2012 to 2014 were extracted from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database. This accounted for 14,944 unique authors. To study the visibility of neurosurgery scholars in terms of social media metrics, the following altmetric indicators were used: Mendeley readers, the post count of news, tweets, blogs, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The methodology and procedures employed included descriptive statistics, chi-square test, two-sample proportion test, and analysis of covariance. The results demonstrated that the number of female scholars was significantly lower compared to their male counterparts. Additionally, female neurosurgery scientists were found to be slightly less prolific in terms of scientific productivity. However, women were slightly more visible with regard to citations, readership, and tweets. Finally, both genders were similarly successful in terms of receivingmentions from blogs, news, Facebook, or LinkedIn.

AB Citizen science involves a range of practices involving public participation in scientific knowledge production, but outcomes evaluation is complicated by the diversity of the goals and forms of citizen science. Publications and citations are not adequate metrics to describe citizen-science productivity. We address this gap by contributing a science products inventory (SPI) tool, iteratively developed through an expert panel and case studies, intended to support general-purpose planning and evaluation of citizen-science projects with respect to science productivity. The SPI includes a collection of items for tracking the production of science outputs and data practices, which are described and illustrated with examples. Several opportunities for further development of the initial inventory are highlighted, as well as potential for using the inventory as a tool to guide project management, funding, and research on citizen science.

AB This study examines a range of factors associated with future citation and altmetric counts to a paper. The factors include journal impact factor, individual collaboration, international collaboration, institution prestige, country prestige, research funding, abstract readability, abstract length, title length, number of cited references, field size, and field type and will be modeled in association with citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter posts, Facebook posts, blog posts, and news posts. The results demonstrate that eight factors are important for increased citation counts, seven different factors are important for increased Mendeley readers, eight factors are important for increased Twitter posts, three factors are important for increased Facebook posts, six factors are important for increased blog posts, and five factors are important for increased news posts. Journal impact factor and international collaboration are the two factors that significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all altmetric scores. Moreover, it seems that the factors driving Mendeley readership are similar to those driving citation counts. However, the altmetric events differ from each other in terms of a small number of factors; for instance, institution prestige and country prestige associate with increased Mendeley readers and blog and news posts, but it is an insignificant factor for Twitter and Facebook posts. The findings contribute to the continued development of theoretical models and methodological developments associated with capturing, interpreting, and understanding altmetric events.

AB Counts of the number of readers registered in the social reference manager Mendeley have been proposed as an early impact indicator for journal articles. Although previous research has shown that Mendeley reader counts for articles tend to have a strong positive correlation with synchronous citation counts after a few years, no previous studies have compared early Mendeley reader counts with later citation counts. In response, this first diachronic analysis compares reader counts within a month of publication with citation counts after 20 months for ten fields. There are moderate or strong correlations in eight out of ten fields, with the two exceptions being the smallest categories (n = 18, 36) with wide confidence intervals. The correlations are higher than the correlations between later citations and early citations, showing that Mendeley reader counts are more useful early impact indicators than citation counts.

AB Online media and especially social media are becoming more and more relevant to our everyday life. Reflecting this tendency in the scientific community, alternative metrics for measuring scholarly impact on the web are increasingly proposed, extending (or even replacing) traditional metrics (e.g., citations, journal impact factor, etc.). This paper explores the relationship between traditional metrics and alternative metrics for psychological research in the years from 2010 to 2012. Traditional publication metrics (e.g., number of citations, impact factor) and alternative metrics (collected from Altmetric, a website that collects and counts references as they appear in Wikipedia, public policy documents, research blogs, mainstream media, or social networks) were extracted and compared, using a dataset of over 245,000 publications from the Web of Science. Results show positive, small to medium, correlations on the level of individual publications, and frequently medium to high correlations on the level of research fields of Psychology. The more accumulated the level of analysis, the higher the correlations. These findings are fairly robust over time and comparable to findings from research areas other than Psychology. Additionally, a new metric, the Score Factor, is proposed as a useful alternative metric to assess a journal's impact in the online media.

AB Objectives TRanslating Emergency Knowledge for Kids (TREKK) and Cochrane Child Health collaborate to develop knowledge products on paediatric emergency medicine topics. Via a targeted social media promotion, we aimed to increase user interaction with the TREKK and Cochrane Child Health Twitter accounts and the uptake of TREKK Bottom Line Recommendations (BLRs) and Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs).
   Design Quantitative descriptive evaluation.
   Setting We undertook this study and collected data via the internet.
   Participants Our target users included online healthcare providers and health consumers.
   Intervention For 16 weeks, we used Twitter accounts (@TREKKca and @Cochrane_Child) and the Cochrane Child Health blog to promote 6 TREKK BLRs and 16 related Cochrane SRs. We published 1 blog post and 98 image-based tweets per week.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was user interaction with @TREKKca and @Cochrane_Child. Secondary outcomes were visits to TREKK's website and the Cochrane Child Health blog, clicks to and views of the TREKK BLRs, and Altmetric scores and downloads of Cochrane SRs.
   Results Followers to @TREKKca and OCochrane_Child increased by 24% and 15%, respectively. Monthly users of TREKK's website increased by 29%. Clicks to the TREKK BLRs increased by 22%. The BLRs accrued 59% more views compared with the baseline period. The 16 blog posts accrued 28% more views compared with the 8 previous months when no new posts were published. The Altmetric scores for the Cochrane SRs increased by AO points each. The mean number of full text downloads for the promotion period was higher for nine and lower for seven SRs compared with the 16-week average for the previous year (mean difference (SD), +4.0 (22.0%)).
   Conclusions There was increased traffic to TREKK knowledge products and Cochrane SRs during the social media promotion. Quantitative evidence supports blogging and tweeting as dissemination strategies for evidence-based knowledge products.

AB The reward system of science is undergoing significant changes, as traditional indicators compete with initiatives that offer novel means of disseminating and assessing scholarly impact. This article considers a number of aspects of this reward system, including authorship, citations, acknowledgements and the growing use of social media platforms by academics, with an eye towards identifying contemporary issues relating to scholarly communication practices, as understood through the perspectives of Bourdieu's symbolic capital and Merton's recognition framework. The article posits that, while scientific capital remains the foundation upon which the reward system of science is built, this system is revealing itself to be more and more multifaceted, extremely complex, and facing increasing tension between its traditional means of evaluation and the potential of new indicators in the digital era. The article presents an extended literature review, as well as recommendations for further consideration and empirical research. A better understanding of the perceptions of academics would be necessary to properly assess the effects of these new indicators on scholarly communication practices and the reward system of science.

AB Altmetrics is complementary to the traditional bibliographic impact measurement techniques. This study explores the extent to which Altmetrics co-relate with the bibliographic impact measurement techniques: H-index and its variants. Analysis is accomplished based on around 70,000 published papers of 45categories from the field of mathematics. Number of tweets containing title, URL, or DOI of research papers has been compared with the H-index, G-index, HC-index, M-quotient and HW-index of the scholar. Analysis has been done for around 57,155 authors and shows that with the very low twitter citation rate that is 1.47%, almost no correlation exists between Twitter citation data and conventional impact measurement techniques. It implies that the social media metrics (Altmetrics) does not reflect the same kind of metrics as bibliometric indices. It further implies that Altmetrics should also be considered along with bibliometric indices to access an author's popularity

ID BROADER IMPACT; REGRESSION; VALIDITY; COUNT
AB In this study, we address the question whether (and to what extent, respectively) altmetrics are related to the scientific quality of papers (as measured by peer assessments). Only a few studies have previously investigated the relationship between altmetrics and assessments by peers. In the first step, we analyse the underlying dimensions of measurement for traditional metrics (citation counts) and altmetrics by using principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). In the second step, we test the relationship between the dimensions and quality of papers (as measured by the post-publication peer-review system of F1000Prime assessments) using regression analysis. The results of the PCA and FA show that altmetrics operate along different dimensions, whereas Mendeley counts are related to citation counts, and tweets form a separate dimension. The results of the regression analysis indicate that citation-based metrics and readership counts are significantly more related to quality, than tweets. This result on the one hand questions the use of Twitter counts for research evaluation purposes and on the other hand indicates potential use of Mendeley reader counts.

   STRATEGIES; LINKING; IMPACT
AB Although counts of tweets citing academic papers are used as an informal indicator of interest, little is known about who tweets academic papers and who uses Twitter to find scholarly information. Without knowing this, it is difficult to draw useful conclusions from a publication being frequently tweeted. This study surveyed 1,912 users that have tweeted journal articles to ask about their scholarly-related Twitter uses. Almost half of the respondents (45%) did not work in academia, despite the sample probably being biased towards academics. Twitter was used most by people with a social science or humanities background. People tend to leverage social ties on Twitter to find information rather than searching for relevant tweets. Twitter is used in academia to acquire and share real-time information and to develop connections with others. Motivations for using Twitter vary by discipline, occupation, and employment sector, but not much by gender. These factors also influence the sharing of different types of academic information. This study provides evidence that Twitter plays a significant role in the discovery of scholarly information and cross-disciplinary knowledge spreading. Most importantly, the large numbers of non-academic users support the claims of those using tweet counts as evidence for the non-academic impacts of scholarly research.

AB The data collection and reporting approaches of four major altmetric data aggregators are studied. The main aim of this study is to understand how differences in social media tracking and data collection methodologies can have effects on the analytical use of altmetric data. For this purpose, discrepancies in the metrics across aggregators have been studied in order to understand how the methodological choices adopted by these aggregators can explain the discrepancies found. Our results show that different forms of accessing the data from diverse social media platforms, together with different approaches of collecting, processing, summarizing, and updating social media metrics cause substantial differences in the data and metrics offered by these aggregators. These results highlight the importance that methodological choices in the tracking, collecting, and reporting of altmetric data can have in the analytical value of the data. Some recommendations for altmetric users and data aggregators are proposed and discussed.

AB The new web-based academic communication platforms do not only enable researchers to better advertise their academic outputs, making them more visible than ever before, but they also provide a wide supply of metrics to help authors better understand the impact their work is making. This study has three objectives: a) to analyse the uptake of some of the most popular platforms (Google Scholar Citations, ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley and Twitter) by a specific scientific community (bibliometrics, scientometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and altmetrics); b) to compare the metrics available from each platform; and c) to determine the meaning of all these new metrics. To do this, the data available in these platforms about a sample of 811 authors (researchers in bibliometrics for whom a public profile Google Scholar Citations was found) were extracted. A total of 31 metrics were analysed. The results show that a high number of the analysed researchers only had a profile in Google Scholar Citations (159), or only in Google Scholar Citations and Research Gate (142). Lastly, we find two kinds of metrics of online impact. First, metrics related to connectivity (followers), and second, all metrics associated to academic impact. This second group can further be divided into usage metrics (reads, views), and citation metrics. The results suggest that Google Scholar Citations is the source that provides more comprehensive citation-related data, whereas Twitter stands out in connectivity-related metrics.

ID ALTMETRICS; HUMANITIES; IMPACT
AB Academic and cultural heritage institutions around the world have made measurable strides in the development of digital sound archives oriented towards research and access, but their impact on scholarship and society has been little studied. Traditionally, impact has been measured by citations; yet these are problematic metrics for nontraditional outputs like sound recordings. Social media data provide a promising avenue of investigation for measuring scholarly as well as societal impact. Twitter in particular has been shown to provide a high number of references for cultural and research outputs in all disciplines. This study analyzes Twitter references pertaining to the collections of five digital sound archives: British Library Sounds, Europeana Sounds, the Internet Archive Audio Archive, PennSound, and UbuWeb. By using text analysis methods to identify high-frequency events and trends, and labeling them with a rubric designed for measuring the impact of digital heritage resources, this study provides preliminary insights on user values as they relate to digital sound collections. Despite the limitations of using social media data, the evidence gathered in this case study characterizes aspects of the use of digital sound collections, and may point to future priorities for the digital preservation of sound.

Three objectives have been established: 1) to offer a general perspective of the altmetrics in Spanish universities, 2) to determine the coverage of Altmetric.com in the Spanish case and 3) to establish which are the most relevant altmetrics. The results show that 42% of the articles in the WoS are indexed in Altmetric.com. The indicators generated by Twitter, the digital press, Facebook and Wikipedia explain 82% of the variance. As conclusions, it is pointed out that: a) publishing in high impact journals and in areas such as Medicine and Biology helps universities to obtain better altmetrics; and b) a small number of indicators is enough to determine the altmetric impact.

AB The news media's citations of journals, authors, and papers have been used avant la letre to study the impact of science in the lay press and some characteristics of scientific journalism. In this paper, the concepts of press citation and media impact are outlined by analogy to those of scientific citation and scientific impact, establishing their similarities and differences. Some possibilities of study using press citations counts are also outlined, as well as the development of new bibliometric indicators to measure the media impact of science. The analysis of press citations has advantages over alternative metrics (altmetrics) because the press is the main news producer and offers a more consolidated product with a professional filter. However, press citations also have some limitations, mainly the lack of a database of press citations from scientific journals in the international lay press.

AB Characterizing the structure of knowledge, the evolution of research topics, and the emergence of topics has always been an important part of information science (IS). Our previous scientometric review of IS provided a snapshot of this fast-growing field up to the end of 2008. This new study aims to identify emerging trends and new developments appearing in the subsequent 7574 articles published in 10 IS journals between 2009 and 2016, including 20,960 references. The results of a document co-citation analysis show great changes in the research topics in the IS domain. The positions of certain core topics found in the previous study, namely, information retrieval, webometrics, and citation behavior, have been replaced by scientometric indicators (H-index), citation analysis (citation performance and bibliometrics), scientific collaboration, and information behavior in the most recent period of 2009-2016. Dual-map overlays of journals show that the knowledge base of IS research has shifted considerably since 2010, with emerging topics including scientific evaluation indicators, altmetrics, science mapping and visualization, bibliometrics, citation analysis, and scientific collaboration.

AB We analyze the impact of open-access (OA) articles published by China and the USA by using Web of Science (WoS) data covering a period of 5 years (2011-2015), five indexes (citation and four altmetric indexes), five disciplines, and three types of articles. With regard to article type, Type I papers are those wherein the authors are all from China or the USA. Type II are those in which the first author is from China or the USA. Type III includes those in which the first author is not from China or the USA. We found that the proportion of OA papers in WoS has been growing in recent years. In terms of citations and altmetric indexes, the mean value of the USA is larger than that of China in general; Type II articles possess the highest value among all papers in the USA, whereas Type III has the highest value in China. Compared with the scenario in citations, social sciences and humanities possess larger altmetric values in China and the USA. The correlation among indicators is similar for the OA papers from China and the USA. Generally, citations cannot effectively represent the altmetric indexes. The gap between China and the USA is the largest in the altmetric attention score and Type I, and the smallest in citations and Type III. Measuring the international impact of OA papers using only citations underestimates the gap between China and the USA.

AB The web-based microblogging platform Twitter is a very popular altmetrics source for measuring the broader impact of science. In this case study, we demonstrate how problematic the use of Twitter data for research evaluation can be, even though the aspiration of measurement is degraded from impact to attention measurement. We collected the Twitter data for the paper published by Yamamizu et al. (Stem Cell Rep 8(3):634-647, 2017. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stemcr.2017.01.023) An investigative committee found that the main figures in the paper are fraudulent.

AB Study Design: Observational study.
   Objectives: To determine the publication rate of podium presentations from the North American Spine Society (NASS) annual meetings from the years 2009 to 2011.
   Methods: In April 2015, a PubMed search was conducted using titles from the paper presentations as well as the authors. Of the search results that were found, the specific scientific journal in which the article was published was recorded. We analyzed further the top 4 destination journals and trends in publications in these journals over the study period. No study funding was obtained for this research, and there are no potential conflicts of interest or associated biases.
   Results: Over the study period, 671 paper presentations were available and 342 were published (51% publication rate). The highest publication rate was from the 2011 annual meeting, with 55.3%, and the lowest year was 2010, with a rate of 46.43%. Spine (32.75%), The Spine Journal (19.01%), Journal of Neurosurgery Spine (7.31%), and European Spine Journal (6.73%) were the top 4 destination journals. Over the study period, we found a significant decrease in publication rate in Spine (P = .001) and a significant increase in publication rate in The Spine Journal (P = .003). There were no significant difference in publication rate over the study period in Journal of Neurosurgery Spine (P = .15) or European Spine Journal (P = .23).
   Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge evaluating the publication rate of podium presentations from recent North American Spine Society annual meetings. We found an overall publication rate of 51%.

ID READERSHIP COUNTS; CITATION COUNTS; INDICATORS
AB This article contains two investigations into Mendeley reader counts with the same dataset. Mendeley reader counts provide evidence of early scholarly impact for journal articles, but reflect the reading of a relatively young subset of all researchers. To investigate whether this age bias is constant or varies by narrow field and publication year, this article compares the proportions of student, researcher and faculty readers for articles published 1996-2016 in 36 large monodisciplinary journals. In these journals, undergraduates recorded the newest research and faculty the oldest, with large differences between journals. The existence of substantial differences in the composition of readers between related fields points to the need for caution when using Mendeley readers as substitutes for citations for broad fields. The second investigation shows, with the same data, that there are substantial differences between narrow fields in the time taken for Scopus citations to be as numerous as Mendeley readers. Thus, even narrow field differences can impact on the relative value of Mendeley compared to citation counts.

AB Traditional citation-based indicators and activities on Online Social Media Platforms (OnSMP; e.g. Twitter) have been used to assess the impact of scientific research. However, the association between traditional indicators (i.e., number of citations and journal impact factor) and the new OnSMP metrics still deserve further investigations. Here, we used multivariate models to evaluate the relative influence of collaboration, time since publication and traditional indicators on the interest of 2863 papers published in five ecological journals from 2013 to 2015 as given by nine OnSMP. We found that most activities were concentrated on Twitter and Mendeley and that activities in these two OnSMP are highly correlated. Our results indicate that traditional indicators explained most of the variation in OnSMP activity. Considering that OnSMP activities are high as soon as the articles are made available online, contrasting with the slow pace in which the citations are accumulated, our results support the use of activities on OnSMP as an early signal of research impact of ecological articles.

ID SCIENCE COMMUNICATION; TWITTER; ARTICLE; NEWS
AB Science communication is seen as critical for the disciplines of ecology and conservation, where research products are often used to shape policy and decision making. Scientists are increasing their online media communication, via social media and news. Such media engagement has been thought to influence or predict traditional metrics of scholarship, such as citation rates. Here, we measure the association between citation rates and the Altrnetric Attention Score-an indicator of the amount and reach of the attention an article has received-along with other forms of bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact factor, and article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated with citation rates. However in recent years, we detected increasing media exposure did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier years; signalling a diminishing return on investment. Citations correlated with journal impact factors up to similar to 13, but then plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing citations does not require publishing in the highest impact journals. We conclude that ecology and conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research through social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance under traditional measures of scholarly activity.

AB This study considered all articles published in six Public Library of Science (PLOS) journals in 2012 and Web of Science citations for these articles as of May 2015. A total of 2,406 articles were analyzed to examine the relationships between Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS) and Web of Science citations. The AAS for an article, provided by Altmetric aggregates activities surrounding research outputs in social media (news outlet mentions, tweets, blogs, Wikipedia, etc.). Spearman correlation testing was done on all articles and articles with AAS. Further analysis compared the stratified datasets based on percentile ranks of AAS: top 50%, top 25%, top 10%, and top 1%. Comparisons across the six journals provided additional insights. The results show significant positive correlations between AAS and citations with varied strength for all articles and articles with AAS (or social media mentions), as well as for normalized AAS in the top 50%, top 25%, top 10%, and top 1% data sets. Four of the six PLOS journals, Genetics, Pathogens, Computational Biology, and Neglected Tropical Diseases, show significant positive correlations across all datasets. However, for the two journals with high impact factors, PLOS Biology and Medicine, the results are unexpected: the Medicine articles showed no significant correlations but the Biology articles tested positive for correlations with the whole dataset and the set with AAS. Both journals published substantially fewer articles than the other four journals. Further research to validate the AAS algorithm, adjust the weighting scheme, and include appropriate social media sources is needed to understand the potential uses and meaning of AAS in different contexts and its relationship to other metrics.

   Cross-Sectional Study
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Altmetric; social impact; clinical trials; low back pain
ID DOWNLOADS
AB Background: There is interest from authors and publishers in sharing the results of their studies over the Internet in order to increase their readership. In this way, articles tend to be discussed and the impact of these articles tends to be increased. In order to measure this type of impact, a new score (named Altmetric) was created. Altmetric aims to understand the individual impact of each article through the attention attracted online.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study was to analyze potential factors related with the publishing journal and the publishing trial that could be associated with Altmetric scores on a random sample of low back pain randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The secondary objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of these trials and their Altmetric scores.
   Methods: We searched for all low back pain RCTs indexed on the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro; www.pedro.org.au) published between 2010 and 2015. A total of 200 articles were randomly selected, and we extracted data related to the publishing trial, the publishing journal, methodological quality of the trials (measured by the 0-10 item PEDro scale), and total and individual scores of Altmetric mentioned and Altmetric reader. The study was a cross-sectional study, and multivariate regression models and descriptive statistics were used.
   Results: A total of four variables were associated with Altmetric mentioned score: impact factor (beta-coefficient=3.4 points), number of years since publication (beta-coefficient=-4.9 points), number of citations divided by years since publication (beta-coefficient=5.2 points), and descriptive title (beta-coefficient=-29.4 points). Only one independent variable was associated with Altmetric reader score: number of citations divided by years since publication (beta-coefficient=10.1 points, 95% CI 7.74-12.46). We also found that the majority of articles were published in English, with a descriptive title, and published in open access journals endorsing the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.
   Conclusions: Researchers should preferably select high impact factor journals for submission and use declarative or interrogative titles, as these factors are likely to increase the visibility of their studies in social media.

The citation counts obtained through Google Scholar (GS) and the altmetrics data obtained from Dspace on the North-West University institutional repository are used to determine these impacts. Further, the conversion rates of ETDs from an educational output into an academic research output are determined using data from GS and the North-West University institutional repository. The results show that the 612 theses and dissertations attracted 931 citations which translates to 1.52 citations per thesis on average. A total of 41.2% theses and dissertations received at least one citation and the conversion rate into academic research output was 16.8%. The conversion rates in the last 3 years that are part of this research is 27.3% which suggests an improvement. An average of 323 PDF views were received per thesis. The citation and PDF views data show that the Engineering ETDs have commendable academic and societal impacts. Nonetheless, the academic impacts show scant correlation with the societal impacts although some positive trends are noticeable when looking at the origin of PDF views and citations by country.

AB The main objective of this work was to group altmetric indicators according to their relationships and detect disciplinary differences with regard to altmetric impact in a set of 3793 research articles published in 2013. Three of the most representative altmetric providers (Altmetric, PlumX and Crossref Event Data) and Scopus were used to extract information about these publications and their metrics. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the information on these metrics and detect groups of indicators. The results show that these metrics can be grouped into three components: social media, gathering metrics from social networks and online media; usage, including metrics on downloads and views; and citations and saves, grouping metrics related to research impact and saves in bookmarking sites. With regard to disciplinary differences, articles in the General category attract more attention from social media, Social Sciences articles have higher usage than Physical Sciences, and General articles are more cited and saved than Health Sciences and Social Sciences articles.

TI Looking Beyond Traditional Metrics in Orthodontics: An Altmetric Study
   on the Most Discussed Articles on the Web
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID RANDOMIZED-CLINICAL-TRIAL; CITATIONS; BLIND
AB Objective: To evaluate the online visibility of the most popular orthodontic articles in Web platforms in relation to publication details and citations.
   Materials and Methods: Altmetric Explorer (Altmetric LLP, London, UK) was searched for articles published in 11 orthodontic journals without time limits in publication and citation on social media. The 200 articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) were collected and screened for data related to publication (date, journal, access), authorship (number of authors, affiliation and origin of the corresponding author), and research (type, subject, funding). Citation counts were harvested from Scopus.
   Results: The top 200 articles presented a median AAS of 8.0 (range: 5.0-196.0), and were mostly bookmarked in Mendeley (median: 16.6 references; range: 0-199.0). American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics, European Journal of Orthodontics and The Angle Orthodontist contributed 86 per cent of the total number of research outputs. Studies investigating socio-demographics had significantly higher AAS compared to diagnostic studies (median AAS: 19.0; range: 7.0-34.0; versus median AAS: 6.0; range: 5.0-10.0. No other study parameter was found to be statistically significant. AAS did not correlate to the number of citations as reported in Scopus.
   Limitations: The early stage of altmetrics and their complementary role in assessing together with the citation-based metrics the research impact need to be acknowledged in the interpretation of the results.
   Conclusions: Visibility of orthodontic articles on the Web is not significantly correlated with citations. Studies on socio-demographics had significantly higher number of online mentions. More constructive online presence of orthodontic journals is needed to reinforce dissemination of research data among scholars and non-scholars.

AB This work presents a new approach for analysing the ability of existing research metrics to identify research which has strongly influenced future developments. More specifically, we focus on the ability of citation counts and Mendeley reader counts to distinguish between publications regarded as seminal and publications regarded as literature reviews by field experts. The main motivation behind our research is to gain a better understanding of whether and how well the existing research metrics relate to research quality. For this experiment we have created a new dataset which we call TrueImpactDataset and which contains two types of publications, seminal papers and literature reviews. Using the dataset, we conduct a set of experiments to study how citation and reader counts perform in distinguishing these publication types, following the intuition that causing a change in a field signifies research quality. Our research shows that citation counts work better than a random baseline (by a margin of 10%) in distinguishing important seminal research papers from literature reviews while Mendeley reader counts do not work better than the baseline.

ID ASSOCIATION; SCIENCE; IMPACT
AB Metrics like the number of tweets or Mendeley readers are currently discussed as an alternative to evaluate research. These alternative metrics (altmetrics) still need to be evaluated in order to fully understand their meaning, their benefits and limitations. While several preceding studies concentrate on correlations of altmetrics with classical measures like citations, this study aims at investigating metric-compatibility within altmetrics. For this purpose, 5000 journal articles from six disciplines have been analyzed regarding their metrics with the help of the aggregators PlumX and Altmetric. com. For this set, the highest numbers of events have been recognized regarding Mendeley readers, followed by Twitter and Facebook mentions. Thereby variations considering the aggregators could be observed. Intra-correlations between the metrics across one aggregator have been calculated, as well as inter-correlations for the corresponding metrics across the aggregators. For both aggregators, low to medium intra-correlations could be calculated which shows the diversity of the different metrics. Regarding inter-correlations, PlumX and Altmetric. com are highly consistent concerning Mendeley readers (r = 0: 97) and Wikipedia mentions (r = 0: 82), whereas the consistency concerning Twitter (r = 0: 49), blogs (r = 0: 46) and Reddit (r = 0: 41) is on a moderate level. The sources Facebook (r = 0: 29), Google+ (r = 0: 28) and News (r = 0: 11) show only low correlations.

TI Perception of the importance of chemistry research papers and comparison
   to citation rates
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID H-INDEX; IMPACT
AB Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.

AB Objective: In 2015 and 2016, the Canadian Journal of Emergency Medicine (CJEM) Social Media (SoMe) Team collaborated with established medical websites to promote CJEM articles using podcasts and infographics while tracking dissemination and readership.
   Methods: CJEM publications in the "Original Research" and "State of the Art" sections were selected by the SoMe Team for podcast and infographic promotion based on their perceived interest to emergency physicians. A control group was composed retrospectively of articles from the 2015 and 2016 issues with the highest Altmetric score that received standard Facebook and Twitter promotions. Studies on SoMe topics were excluded. Dissemination was quantified by January 1, 2017 Altmetric scores. Readership was measured by abstract and full-text views over a 3-month period. The number needed to view (NNV) was calculated by dividing abstract views by full-text views.
   Results: Twenty-nine of 88 articles that met inclusion were included in the podcast (6), infographic (11), and control (12) groups. Descriptive statistics (mean, 95% confidence interval) were calculated for podcast (Altmetric: 61, 42-80; Abstract: 1795, 1135-2455; Full-text: 431, 0-1031), infographic (Altmetric: 31.5, 19-43; Abstract: 590, 361-819; Full-text: 65, 33-98), and control (Altmetric: 12, 8-15; Abstract: 257, 159-354; Full-Text: 73, 38-109) articles. The NNV was 4.2 for podcast, 9.0 for infographic, and 3.5 for control articles.
   Discussion: Limitations included selection bias, the influence of SoMe promotion on the Altmetric scores, and a lack of generalizability to other journals.
   Conclusion: Collaboration with established SoMe websites using podcasts and infographics was associated with increased Altmetric scores and abstract views but not full-text article views.

ID DISCIPLINARY DIFFERENCES
AB Introduction. Altmetrics is an area under construction, with a potential to study the impacts of academic products from social media data. It is believed that altmetrics can capture social and academic impacts, going beyond measures obtained using bibliometric and scientometric indicators. This research aimed to analyse aspects, characteristics and potentialities for the measuring of the social impact provided by altmetrics in social media.
   Method. 100 papers with higher altmetric scores were gathered from SciELO's database using the altmetric.com tool.
   Analysis. Profiles from individuals on Facebook and Twitter acting or reacting to the papers were analysed. These profiles were categorized as Social Impact and Academic Impact.
   Results. The results strongly indicate the impact measured using altmetrics greatly reproduces the scientist-to scientist relation, as do bibliometrics and scientometrics.
   Conclusion. The social impact measured by actions and interactions on Facebook and Twitter reach a significant 36%, attesting the potentiality of altmetrics for measurement, in addition to the academic impact and the impact of scientific results in society.

AB The Nature Index (NI) has become a rather powerful tool to identify emerging trends in various research fields. According to the NI 2015 released at the beginning of 2016, China, the world's second largest producer of research papers, maintains a strong momentum on scientific output. Based on online source metrics such as Mendeley book-marks, we evaluated multi-viewed impact of the top 50 academic institutions in the NI China. For the selection of multiple metrics, we investigated the presence and coverage of different kinds of online metrics, with a particular focus on their correlations with traditional citation-based metrics. In addition, Mendeley, Twitter, and Scopus are chosen as the complementary sources for multi-metrics. We sorted three ranks of the top 50 institutions in the NI China based on citation counts in Scopus, reader counts on Mendeley, and Twitter counts and we analyzed the differences among various ranking results. The diverse metrics revealed different aspects on institutions' academic impact.

We call this method multifaceted analysis of disciplines through academic profiles (MADAP). The international community of researchers working in Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, Informetrics, Webometrics, and Altmetrics was selected as a case study. The records of the top 1000 most cited documents by these authors according to GSC were manually processed to fill any missing information and deduplicate fields like the journal titles and book publishers. The results suggest that it is feasible to use GSC and the MADAP method to produce an accurate depiction of the community of researchers working in Bibliometrics (both specialists and occasional researchers) and their publication habits (main publication venues such as journals and book publishers). Additionally, the wide document coverage of Google Scholar (specially books and book chapters) enables more comprehensive analyses of the documents published in a specific discipline than were previously possible with other citation indexes, finally shedding light on what until now had been a blind spot in most citation analyses.

AB A data array of Russian publications for 2015 registered in the SCI-E DB was evaluated for the correlation between traditional bibliometrics and altmetrics. A special methodology based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient was developed for this purpose. In the case of publications, the correlation between the citedness of a publication (the value of the TC field in the SCI-E DB) and its usage (fields U1 and U2) was evaluated. In the case of source journals for the indicated publications, the correlation was determined between the Cited_Half-Life value and the values of journal-usage metrics, which were determined as the mean U1 (U2) value taken for all publications of the journal. It was established that the nature of journal distribution according to the Cited_Half-Life value of the source journals for Russian publications practically coincides with the nature of the distribution of source journals for publications of the entire global flow: the Russian distribution shifted somewhat toward larger Cited_Half-Life values (the median of the global distribution was 6.1, while that of the Russian distribution was 6.2). This shift increased sharply upon considering the number of Russian and global journal publications, respectively (the median of the global distribution was 5.8, while that of the Russian distribution was 6.8).

   Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
ID H-INDEX; RADIOLOGY; IMPACT
AB Background: The impact of scholarly output is typically measured by the number of citations and, more recently, downloads. Newer metrics have been developed to reflect digital dissemination of knowledge such as the Altmetric and Mendeley reader scores. This article examines the relationship among citations, download rates, Altmetric scores, and Mendeley reader scores in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.
   Methods: The authors accessed the 55 most-cited articles published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery from 2014 to 2015. Altmetric scores, download rates, field-weighted citations, and Mendeley reader number were extracted. Correlation matrices were used to identify methodologies positively correlating between scores. The top-ranked articles were then collectively evaluated for central subject themes and unifying scoring methodologies.
   Results: The highest Altmetric score obtained was 159, the greatest number of citations was 52, and the greatest number of downloads was 41. There was no apparent correlation between Altmetric scores and Scopus citations (p = 0.58) or article subject themes (p = 0.63). Citation was positively associated with download rates (r = 0.31, p = 0.021) and Mendeley reader number (r = 0.46, p = 0.001). Mendeley reader number demonstrated high precision in identifying top-ranked citation articles (p = 0.044) despite its lack of direct association with Altmetric score (p = 0.83).
   Conclusions: With the growing public desire for evidence-based publications, our study quantifies the unique nature of Altmetric score while discouraging its use in isolation. Download rates are a more rapid measure of publication impact compared with citation number. Mendeley readership is also promising as an alternative index.

ID IMPACT FACTOR; METRICS
AB Altmetrics from Altmetric.com are widely used by publishers and researchers to give earlier evidence of attention than citation counts. This article assesses whether Altmetric.com scores are reliable early indicators of likely future impact and whether they may also reflect non-scholarly impacts. A preliminary factor analysis suggests that the main altmetric indicator of scholarly impact is Mendeley reader counts, with weaker news, informational and social network discussion/promotion dimensions in some fields. Based on a regression analysis of Altmetric.com data from November 2015 and Scopus citation counts from October 2017 for articles in 30 narrow fields, only Mendeley reader counts are consistent predictors of future citation impact. Most other Altmetric.com scores can help predict future impact in some fields. Overall, the results confirm that early Altmetric.com scores can predict later citation counts, although less well than journal impact factors, and the optimal strategy is to consider both Altmetric.com scores and journal impact factors. Altmetric.com scores can also reflect dimensions of non-scholarly impact in some fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the results of a pilot project investigating Russian scholarly publications using the altmetric indicators "Usage Count Last 180 days" (U1) and "Usage Count Since 2013" (U2) introduced by Web of Science. We explored the relationship between citation impact and both types of usage counts. The data set consisted of 37,281 records (publications) indexed by SCI-E in 2015. Seven broad research areas were selected to observe citation patterns and usage counts. A significant difference was found between mean citations and mean usage counts (U2) in a few research areas. We discovered a significant Kendall rank correlation between the citation metrics and usage metrics at the article level. This correlation is particularly strong for the longer period usage metric (U2). We also analyzed the relationship between usage metrics and traditional journal-level citation metrics. Very weak correlation was observed.

AB Objectives/Hypothesis: Evaluate the use of Twitter by otolaryngology journals and determine the relationship between social media altmetrics and measures of academic impact.
   Study DesignCross-sectional analysis.
   Methods: Twitter profiles from the top 50 otolaryngology journals per 2016 SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) were included. Twitter activity for each profile was calculated using Twitonomy analytics and Riffle software. Social media influence was measured using Klout scores. Annual SJR rank and H-Index scores between 2008 and 2016 were recorded for each journal. Associations between social media influence and academic indices were assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test, Spearman's rank order test, and Pearson correlation coefficients (alpha = .05).
   Results: Average SJR was 0.86 +/- 0.3 and H-Index was 50.9 +/- 24. Eighteen journals had Twitter profiles. Journals with social media accounts had significantly higher SJR (P = .03) and H-Index (P = .01) scores compared to those without. The average Klout score of Twitter profiles was 32.5 +/- 13. There was a significant association between a journal's Klout score and SJR rank (P = .004). Older Twitter profiles had higher Klout scores (P = .04). There was a direct relationship between a journal's total Twitter followers and H-Index score (P = .009), and a direct relationship between tweets and academic influence (P = .03 and .01 for SJR and H-Index, respectively).
   Conclusions: Social media is often underutilized and remains an untapped resource by many journals to increase readership and disseminate research. Journals with social media profiles had significantly higher academic metrics, and among journals with profiles, increased online activity was a predictor for academic influence. Future studies are warranted to elucidate causal relationships.

   Factors; altmetrics; research assessment
AB Introduction and objective: There is a pressing need to improve the ways in which the output of scientific research is evaluated by funding agencies, academic institutions, and other parties. To address this issue, a group of editors and publishers of scholarly journals met during the Annual Meeting of The American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) in San Francisco, CA, on December 16, 2012. Method: The group developed a set of recommendations, referred to as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. Results and Discussion: The Journal Impact Factor is frequently used as the primary parameter with which to compare the scientific output of individuals and institutions. The Journal Impact Factor has a number of well-documented deficiencies as a tool for research assessment: citation distributions within journals are highly skewed; the properties of the Journal Impact Factor are field-specific: it is a composite of multiple, highly diverse article types, including primary research papers and reviews; Journal Impact Factors can be manipulated by editorial policy and data used to calculate the Journal Impact Factors are neither transparent nor openly available to the public. Our recommendations focus primarily on practices relating to research articles published in peer-reviewed journals but can and should be extended by recognizing additional products, such as datasets, as important research outputs. These recommendations are aimed at funding agencies, academic institutions, journals, organizations that supply metrics, and individual researchers. Conclusions: A number of themes run through these recommendations: the need to eliminate the use of journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, in funding, appointment, and promotion considerations; the need to assess research on its own merits rather than on the basis of the journal in which the research is published; and the need to capitalize on the opportunities provided by online publication (such as relaxing unnecessary limits on the number of words, figures, and references in articles, and exploring new indicators of significance and impact).

We analyse the recent trends in research productivity and academic publishing and scrutinize the novelties such as PlumX and Publons. Moreover, we tackle the issue of gaming with altmetrics using new digital technologies. Apart from that, we focus on the world's two most prestigious journal indexation databases, Scopus and Web of Science, and demonstrate how academic productivity might differ across academic fields and countries using their data and analytical tools. Our results might be helpful and useful in finding connections and links between research functionality, efficiency and classifications of academic productivity yielded in published research output (such as the number of papers, books, or book chapters calibrated by the impact factor (IF) or Scopus journal ranking (SJR)). The outcomes of our research would be of a special importance for bibliometricians, librarians, research policy specialists, and other global research, education, and academic stakeholders.

AB Academic librarians in sub-Saharan Africa, just like their counterparts in the rest of the world, are under pressure to provide relevant information services to satisfy varied client needs. Research administrators, grant offices, researchers, students and university managers, among others, are increasingly turning to academic librarians for information to meet their myriad research-related information and metrics needs. Sub-Saharan African countries' emphasis on strengthening science, technology and innovation has exerted further pressure on information professionals and other stakeholders to develop and appropriately apply bibliometrics and altmetrics to inform decision-making and policy-formulation processes. Research output and impact metrics are not only quickly evolving but their volume has been unprecedented. This paper's focus is the application of bibliometrics and altmetrics by academic librarians to support researchers in their respective universities. The paper argues that there is need for up-skilling or re-skilling the 21st-century sub-Saharan African academic librarian to select and apply appropriate metrics, tools and strategies to support researchers as they execute their responsibilities. The paper offers possible areas of training for academic librarians.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the capabilities, functionalities and appropriateness of Altmetric.com as a data source for the bibliometric analysis of books in comparison to PlumX.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors perform an exploratory analysis on the metrics the Altmetric Explorer for Institutions, platform offers for books. The authors use two distinct data sets of books. On the one hand, the authors analyze the Book Collection included in Altmetric.com. On the other hand, the authors use Clarivate's Master Book List, to analyze Altmetric.com's capabilities to download and merge data with external databases. Finally, the authors compare the findings with those obtained in a previous study performed in PlumX.
   Findings Altmetric.com combines and orderly tracks a set of data sources combined by DOI identifiers to retrieve metadata from books, being Google Books its main provider. It also retrieves information from commercial publishers and from some Open Access initiatives, including those led by university libraries, such as Harvard Library. We find issues with linkages between records and mentions or ISBN discrepancies. Furthermore, the authors find that automatic bots affect greatly Wikipedia mentions to books. The comparison with PlumX suggests that none of these tools provide a complete picture of the social attention generated by books and are rather complementary than comparable tools.
   Practical implications This study targets different audience which can benefit from the findings. First, bibliometricians and researchers who seek for alternative sources to develop bibliometric analyses of books, with a special focus on the Social Sciences and Humanities fields. Second, librarians and research managers who are the main clients to which these tools are directed. Third, Altmetric.com itself as well as other altmetric providers who might get a better understanding of the limitations users encounter and improve this promising tool.
   Originality/value This is the first study to analyze Altmetric.com's functionalities and capabilities for providing metric data for books and to compare results from this platform, with those obtained via PlumX.

ID INDICATORS
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide, through a set of indicators, an overview of the way in which Spanish institutional repositories are run and the services they offer their respective institutions and other users. The selected descriptors are based on aspects related to technology, procedures, content, marketing and the personnel responsible for managing repositories.
   Design/methodology/approach In order to establish the indicators, a thorough review of the literature was carried out to identify existing indicators that are used to assess repositories. These were divided into five categories (technology, procedures, content, marketing and personnel) with a total of 48 components. An online survey was conducted with the repositories managers of 66 Spanish research institutions in order to verify the degree of fulfilment of the selected indicators.
   Findings The survey received forty-six responses, which represented a response rate of 69 per cent. Of these, 44 came from universities and two from research centres. In total, 65 per cent of the repositories have the capacity to import data from and export data to other university systems, mainly Current Research Information System (32 per cent). Most repositories have mechanisms for the large-scale import and export of metadata and digital objects (83 per cent). The use of altmetrics in repositories is widespread (44 per cent). Authors and librarians deposit most frequently (37 and 32 per cent, respectively), in spite of the fact that 44 per cent do not have full-time staff working in the repository. In more than 80 per cent of the repositories, between 90 and 100 per cent of the deposits are full-text documents. With respect to the tools used to promote the repository within the institution, these are primarily face-to-face training sessions (82 per cent), followed by support materials such as manuals and help pages (65 per cent). The academic authorities encourage open access among researchers in 56 per cent of cases, a significant element in repository marketing.
   Originality/value This work proposes a model based on five dimensions and 48 indicators to assess institutional repositories. This approach has been applied to Spanish institutional repositories to provide up-to-date information about their management procedures and promotional methods and the services they offer authors and the university community. This overview of Spanish repositories has provided an insight into the way in which repositories have evolved in recent years and allowed potential improvements to be identified based on the most advanced repositories. This model can also be exported to assess institutional repositories in other countries.

ID VISION
AB Purpose The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted wide attention from researchers to address the potential of this technology in various industries recently. This study aims to investigate different characteristics of worldwide research on the IoT using bibliometrics, network analysis and altmetrics. Growth of the literature, publication types, languages, publication countries and research subjects are addressed. The scientific and social impact of the journal articles has also been examined using citation and altmetrics scores.
   Design/methodology/approach The Scopus database was searched for articles indexed under the terms Internet of Thing* or IoT or Internet of Everything* or Web of Thing*, and a total of 13,725 articles from 2011 to 2016 were retrieved and analysed.
   Findings There was a continuous increase in the number of publications per year over the period, with a 6.7-fold rise in the number of publications, with the highest share of research output (4,989) published in 2016. Contribution of authors at the micro, meso and macro levels was analysed. About 89 per cent of total publications were the result of collaborative efforts, and Asia-Pacific was responsible for almost 53 per cent of world scientific production of IoT literature. Generally, the IoT research are found in publications concentrating on computer networks and communications, electrical and electronic engineering and computer science applications. The results also showed that the presence of IoT research on the social web is still low, with 6.8 per cent of total publications presenting some altmetric activity.
   Research limitations/implications The work reported is limited to only Scopus-indexed publications. While the search methodology aimed to be as inclusive as possible, it may not have captured all scholarly research output in the IoT world.
   Practical implications The findings of this study may help researchers understand the performance of IoT research from across the world and suggest directions for further research.
   Originality/value This paper reviews the literature of the IoT in past five years using rigorous bibliometric, altmetric and network analysis tools.

AB Traditionally, scholars focused their efforts in the domains of clinical care, research, and education; however, the last decade has witnessed the rise of novel areas of development such as innovation, quality improvement, informatics, and recently, digital scholarship. Academic institutions adapted and began considering these fields for academic promotion and tenure. Social media has become a critical space for the dissemination of knowledge and outreach to community and policy makers and also for the creation of communities of practice. This new realm brings multiple challenges, such as the appraisal of the quality and appropriateness of the content, the evaluation of impact on the academe and general populations, coupled to the creation of a system to reward scholars engaged in this novel endeavor. In this article, we describe the current state of academic promotion and the definition, nature, and merit of digital scholarship. We outline new strategies and tools for the assessment of dissemination and impact of these works, such as altmetrics, and finally, we reference innovative concepts on how to organize and use this digital academia on career promotion and tenure.

AB Purpose By analyzing journal articles with high citation counts but low Twitter mentions and vice versa, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overall picture of differences between citation counts and Twitter mentions of academic articles.
   Design/methodology/approach Citation counts from the Web of Science and Twitter mentions of psychological articles under the Social Science Citation Index collection were collected for data analysis. An approach combining both statistical and simple content analysis was adopted to examine important factors contributing to citation counts and Twitter mentions, as well as the patterns of tweets mentioning academic articles.
   Findings Compared to citation counts, Twitter mentions have stronger affiliations with readability and accessibility of academic papers. Readability here was defined as the content size of articles and the usage of jargon and scientific expressions. In addition, Twitter activities, such as the use of hashtags and user mentions, could better facilitate the sharing of articles. Even though discussions of articles or related social phenomena were spotted in the contents of tweets, simple counts of Twitter mentions may not be reliable enough for research evaluations due to issues such as Twitter bots and a deficient understanding of Twitter users' motivations for mentioning academic articles on Twitter.
   Originality/value This study has elaborated on the differences between Twitter mentions and citation counts by comparing the characteristics of Twitter-inclined and citation-inclined articles. It provides useful information for interested parties who would like to adopt social web metrics such as Twitter mentions as traces of broader engagement with academic literature and potential suggestions to increase the reliability of Twitter metrics. In addition, it gives specific tips for researchers to increase research visibility and get attention from the general public on Twitter.

AB Citation count is an important indicator for measuring research outputs. There have been numerous studies that have investigated factors affecting citation counts from the perspectives of cited papers and citing papers. In this paper, we focused specifically on citing papers and explored citations sourced from prestigious affiliations in the computer science discipline. The QS World University Rankings was employed to identify prestigious citations, named QS citations. We used the Microsoft Academic Graph, a massive scholarly dataset, and conducted different kinds of analysis between papers with QS citations and those without QS citations. We discovered that papers with QS citations are generally associated with higher total citation counts than those without QS citations. We extended the analysis to authors and journals, and the results indicated that when authors or journals have higher proportions of papers with QS citations, they are usually associated with higher values of the H-index or the Journal Impact Factor respectively. Additionally, papers with QS citations are also associated with a higher Altmetric Attention Score and a higher number of specific types of altmetrics such as tweet counts.

AB Over the last decades, CSCW research has undergone significant structural changes and has grown steadily with manifested differences from other fields in terms of theory building, methodology, and socio-technicality. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the scientific literature for mapping the intellectual structure of CSCW research and its scientific development over a 15-year period (2001-2015). A total of 1713 publications were subjected to examination in order to draw statistics and depict dynamic changes to shed new light upon the growth, spread, and collaboration of CSCW devoted outlets. Overall, our study characterizes top (cited and downloaded) papers, citation patterns, prominent authors and institutions, demographics, collaboration patterns, most frequent topic clusters and keywords, and social mentions by country, discipline, and professional status. The results highlight some areas of improvement for the field and a lot of well-established topics which are changing gradually with impact on citations and downloads. Statistical models reveal that the field is predominantly influenced by fundamental and highly recognized scientists and papers. A small number of papers without citations, the growth of the number of papers by year, and an average number of more than 39 citations per paper in all venues ensure the field a healthy and evolving nature. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the influence of CSCW on the larger field of HCI.

AB Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) is an increasingly popular composite altmetric measure, which is being criticized for an inappropriate and arbitrary aggregation of different altmetric sources into a single measure. We examined this issue empirically, by testing unidimensionality and the component structure congruence of the five 'key' AAS components: News, Blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. As a reference point, these tests were also done on different citation data: WoS, Scopus, and Google Scholar. All tests were done for groups of articles with: (1) high citations, but lower AAS (HCGs), and (2) high AAS, but lower citations (HAGs). Changes in component structures over time (from 2016 to 2017) were also considered. Citation data consistently formed congruent unidimensional structures for all groups and over time. Altmetric data formed congruent unidimensional structures only for the HCGs, with much inconsistency for the HAGs (including change over time). The relationship between Twitter and News counts was shown to be curvilinear. It was not possible to obtain a satisfactory congruent and reliable linear unidimensional altmetric structure between the groups for any variable combination, even after Mendeley and CiteULike altmetric counts were included. Correlations of altmetric aggregates and citations were fairly inconsistent between the groups. We advise against the usage of composite altmetric measures (including the AAS) for any group comparison purposes, until the measurement invariance issues are dealt with. The underlying pattern of associations between individual altmetrics is likely too complex and inconsistent across conditions to justify them being simply aggregated into a single score.

AB This paper aims at analysing the perception and attitudes of editors of Spanish scientific journals about some of the most important advances in scholarly communication linked with ICTs and the Internet: the advantages and disadvantages attributed to open access, open peer review and alt-metrics. Fifteen in-depth interviews have been conducted with the people in charge of Spanish journals indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus, attending to a fair representation of all areas of knowledge. Findings show a wide negative perception of all these tools, due to the fear of a loss of reputation for the journal which may use these innovations. Only open access is positively perceived.

AB Making scholarly information visible to web search engines is an ongoing challenge, and undergraduate research is no exception. Using a sample of award-winning undergraduate history papers and journals, the authors searched Google, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and the authors' institutional repository to gauge the difficulty of locating these works. Given that many of these works were not easily found, results suggest that libraries and their institutions could be doing more to increase the discoverability of undergraduate research. Based on the success stories observed in this study, we offer strategies to libraries and librarians for increasing the visibility of undergraduate student research.

While large universities have the resources for entire departments devoted to bibliometrics, the authors of this article give strategies for faculty publishing support at a smaller liberal arts university. The authors created a LibGuide with publishing resources and presented the initiative to several academic divisions. Faculty were surveyed, and the results indicated that the majority of respondents were interested in assessing journal quality and viewed the library as a resource for help with the publishing process.

ID ALTERNATIVE METRICS; CITATION ANALYSIS; REVIEWS; LEVEL
AB Books are an important source of knowledge to disseminate information. Researchers and academicians write books to propagate their innovative research or teachings amongst academic as well as non-academic audience. The number of books written every year is increasing rapidly. According to International Publisher Association (IPA) annual report 2015-2016, around 150 million different books were published worldwide in 2014-2015. Many e-commerce websites are also involved in selling books. A recent addition to book publishing world is e-books, which have really made it very simple to publish. While, availability of large number of books is good for readers, at the same time it is challenging to find a good book, particularly in scholarly settings. Researchers in the area of Scientometrics have attempted to view assessment of goodness of a scholarly book by measuring citations that a book receive. However, citations alone are not a true measure of a book's impact. Many a times people use the knowledge in a book without actually citing it. Also use of books in classroom settings or for general reading often is not reflected in terms of citations. Therefore, it is important to obtain users's opinion about a book from other forms of data. Fortunately, we have now some data of this sort available in form of reviews, downloads and social media mentions etc. Amazon and Goodreads, both of which provide the readers' views about a book, are two good examples. This paper presents an exploratory research work on using these non-traditional data about books to assess impact of a book. A set of Scopus-indexed computer science books with good citations as well as some other popular books in computer science domain are used for analysis. The reviews of books have been crawled in an automated fashion from Amazon and Goodreads. Thereafter sentiment analysis is carried out the text of reviews. Results of sentiment analysis are compared and correlated with traditional impact assessment metrics. The experimental analysis does not show a coherent relationship between citation and online reviews. Also, majority of the online reviews are found to be positive for large number of books in the dataset. As a related exercise, the Scopus citation data and Google scholar citation data for books are also compared. A high value of correlation is observed in these two. Overall the exploratory analysis provides a useful insight into the problem of book impact assessment.

DE Scholarly articles; altmetrics; ResearchGate; social network analysis;
   Indian Research Output
ID RESEARCHGATE; IMPACT
AB Scholarly articles are considered one of the primary medium for dissemination of inventions and discoveries. Traditionally, usefulness and popularity of a scholarly article has been measured in terms of citations it receives. However, in the changed research publishing landscape, where most of the publications are now available in digital form accessible through various digital libraries; new measures of measuring usefulness of scholarly articles have emerged. Nowadays, scholarly articles are easily available for access and download from various digital access portals. The use and popularity of these digital access portals has also made it possible to integrate various social media platforms with journal access and use. Most of the journals now maintain statistics about reads, number of downloads, social profile shares etc. Several newer platforms like ResearchGate, Academia and Mendeley have also become popular. Researchers now often share their articles on various such platforms and also use social media channels to disseminate their article to a wider audience. This transformed environment has allowed to track and measure usefulness and popularity of scholarly articles through alternative metrics (now popularly known as Altmetrics) as compared to traditional citation impact measures. Altmetrics attempts to derive impact of a scholarly article by using data from different kinds such as social network share, mentions, tweets etc. The use of Altmetrics varies widely from country to country and discipline to discipline. This paper attempts to present findings of an exploratory analysis of relevance of Altmetrics data through a case study of scholarly articles from India published during 2016 and indexed in Web of Science and also updated on ResearchGate. The results obtained provide an interesting insight on relatedness and correlation of presence of scholarly articles in Web of Science and ResearchGate. It is observed that about 61% papers indexed inWeb of Science have an entry in ResearchGate. There are, however, disciplinary variations in presence of articles in ResearchGate. Only about 61% of the total disciplines in Web of Science are found to be covered in ResearchGate.

AB Objective. It was proposed an altmetric index to identify the most consulted titles of Cuban publishers that distribute their contents on the e-Libro.com academic platform.
   Design/Methodology/Approach. The Wally Index is defined as the quotient of the Ln (# queries) of a title between the maximum Ln (# queries) of the set of titles evaluated in a defined period of time. The usefulness of this Index was validated from the study of the distribution of titles of six Cuban publishers that include their titles in the academic platform e-Libro.com, during the period September 2016 - August 2017.
   Results/Discussion. The Wally Index vs. # Titles of Cuban publishers available on e-libro.com were adjusted to the power model, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.7299, although titles with smaller numbers of queries showed greater dispersion, so that evaluated this index with the collection of the 226 most consulted titles. With this sample, the Wally Index normalized vs. ranking of the titles reached the value of the Pearson correlation coefficients R-2 = 0.8992 with a logarithmic adjustment
   Conclusions. The use of the Wally Index is proposed for the evaluation of the queries of a set of titles, selected under specific criteria, available on Web platforms that provide data on the queries. The index is relative to the collection of titles and is independent of the number of queries.
   Originality/Value. The Wally Index can be used by any publisher who wants to examine the queries that receive their titles in the web environment.

AB This study analyses the correlations between data provided by the traditional citation systems on one hand and altmetrics on the other hand, related to the articles published in the journal Comunicar during five years. This journal stands out among the others in its field due to its advanced social media marketing plan. First, a presentation of the most representative aspects of altmetrics is given, according to published studies. Next, a bibliographic review is carried out on the publications dealing with the subject of the correlations and that emphasize the low correlation between citations and altmetrics. With the aim of helping researchers to understand what they involved and how they are used for their own benefit, this review is followed by a cross-metric validation study of the articles that concludes that altmetrics do not measure the authors' scientific impact, but they are significant in assessing the level of attention received by their publications in different fields and indicate the interest and the importance of using social media, especially Mendeley and Twitter, to give visibility and disseminate their scientific outputs.

Here we show that the will to understand the rationale behind the score should also consider the ratio between full-text sources uploaded to the repository and publications. The finding supports the claim that the RG score is not a reliable indicator of scientific and academic reputation. Instead, it appears to be much more a tool to implement the entrepreneurial strategy of the RG's owner company.

AB More than 5 years after their emergence, altmetrics are still seen as a promise to complement traditional citation-based indicators. However, no study has focused on their potential usefulness to capture the impact of scholarly books. While recent literature shows that citation indicators cannot fully capture the impact of books, other studies have suggested alternative indicators such as usage, publishers' prestige or library holdings. In this paper, we calculate 18 indicators which range from altmetrics to library holdings, views, downloads or citations to the production of monographs of a Spanish university using the bibliometric suite PlumX from EBSCO. The objective of the study is to adopt a multidimensional perspective on the analysis of books and understand the level of complementarity between these different indicators. Also, we compare the overview offered by this range of indicators when applied to monographs with the traditional bibliometric perspective focused on journal articles and citation impact. We observe a low presence of altmetric indicators for monographs, even lower than for journal articles and a predominance of library holdings, confirming this indicator as the most promising one towards the analysis of the impact of books.

AB Reader counts from the social reference sharing site Mendeley are known to be valuable for early research evaluation. They have strong correlations with citation counts for journal articles but appear about a year before them. There are disciplinary differences in the value of Mendeley reader counts but systematic evidence is needed at the level of narrow fields to reveal its extent. In response, this article compares Mendeley reader counts with Scopus citation counts for journal articles from 2012 in 325 narrow Scopus fields. Despite strong positive correlations in most fields, averaging 0.671, the correlations in some fields are as weak as 0.255. Technical reasons explain most weaker correlations, suggesting that the underlying relationship is almost always strong. The exceptions are caused by unusually high educational or professional use or topics of interest within countries that avoid Mendeley. The findings suggest that if care is taken then Mendeley reader counts can be used for early citation impact evidence in almost all fields and for related impact in some of the remainder. As an additional application of the results, cross-checking with Mendeley data can be used to identify indexing anomalies in citation databases.

AB This bibliometric analysis deals with research on the collapse of the Maya civilizationa research topic with a long-lasting history, which has been boosted significantly by recent paleoclimatic research. The study is based on a publication set of 433 papers published between 1923 and 2016. The publications covered by the Web of Science (WoS) show a significant increase since 1990, reaching about 30 papers per year at present. The results show that the current discourse on the collapse of the Maya civilization is focused on the role of climate as a major factor for the demise of this ancient civilization. The bibliometric analyses also reveal that (1) paleoclimatic records become numerous and are increasingly better dated; (2) the explanatory power of the records has been significantly increased by analyzing samples from regions closer to the relevant Maya sites; and (3) interdisciplinary cooperation of the humanities (archeology, anthropology, history) with natural sciences disciplines (geoscience, ecology, paleoclimatology, meteorology) seems to be highly promising. The collapse of the Maya civilization is a good example of how natural sciences entered research in the humanities and social sciences (anthropology, archeology, history) and boosted research (and solutions) around long-discussed, but unsolved questions.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB Aim
   Social media (SoMe) platforms have become leading methods of communication and dissemination of scientific information in the medical community. They allow for immediate discussion and widespread engagement around important topics. It has been hypothesized that the activity on Twitter positively correlates with highly cited articles. The purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence and activity of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals on Twitter, with the hypothesis that impact factor is positively associated with Twitter usage.
   Methods
   The top 50 Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals, ranked by 2016 Impact Factor were analyzed. The Twitter profiles of each journal or affiliated society were identified. Other SoMe platforms used were also recorded. Twitonomy software (Digonomy Pty Ltd, New South Wales, Australia) was used to analyze the Twitter profiles over a one-year period. Twitter Klout Scores were recorded for each journal to approximate the SoMe influence. Altmetric Scores (the total number of mentions via alternative metrics) were also recorded. Statistical analysis was carried out to identify correlations between journal Impact Factors, SoMe activity, Twitter Klout Scores and Altmetric Scores.
   Results
   Twenty-two journals (44%) had dedicated Twitter profiles. Fourteen journals (28%) were associated with societies that had profiles and 14 journals (28%) had no Twitter presence. The mean Impact Factor overall was 2.16 +/- 0.14 (range, 1.07-5.16). The journals with dedicated Twitter profiles had higher Impact Factors than those without (mean 2.41 vs. 1.61; P=0.005). A greater number of Twitter followers were associated with higher Impact Factors (R2 0.317, P=0.03). Journals with higher Twitter Klout Scores had higher Impact Factors (R2 0.357, P=0.016). Altmetric Score was positively associated with Impact Factor (R2 0.310, P=0.015). Journals with higher numbers of retweets (virtual citations in the Twittersphere) had higher Altmetric Scores (R2 0.463, P=0.015).
   Conclusion
   Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery journals with dedicated Twitter profiles have higher Impact Factors than those without. Altmetrics is likely to play a significant role in the literature evaluation going forward along with the traditional metrics. The engagement with Twitter by Trauma and Orthopaedic surgeons should be encouraged.

ID BROADER IMPACT; ALTMETRICS; JOURNALS; PLOS
AB The rapid growth of online tools to communicate scientific research raises the important question of whether online attention is associated with citations in the scholarly literature. The Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) quantifies the attention received by a scientific publication on various online platforms including news, blogs and social media. It has been advanced as a rapid way of gauging the impact of a piece of research, both in terms of potential future scholarly citations and wider online engagement. Here, we explore variation in the AAS of 2677 research articles published in 10 ornithological journals between 2012 and 2016. On average, AAS increased sevenfold in just five years, primarily due to increased activity on Twitter which contributed 75% of the total score. For a subset of 878 articles published in 2014, including an additional 323 ornithology articles from non-specialist journals, an increase in AAS from 1 to 20 resulted in a predicted 112% increase in citation count from 2.6 to 5.5 citations per article. This effect interacted with journal impact factor, with weaker effects of AAS in higher impact factor journals. Our results suggest that altmetrics (or the online activity they measure), as well as complementing traditional measures of scholarly impact in ornithology such as citations, may also anticipate or even drive them.

AB This study aims to investigate the altmetric activity of papers published by the University of Zagreb School of Medicine in internationally visible journals and to identify differences in altmetric activity between the papers published in international and local journals and between those published in English and Croatian. We also investigated changes in altmetric activity over time and the characteristics of papers with the highest Twitter and Mendeley activity.
   The sample included 390 papers collected from the bibliographic database Scopus. Their altmetric and citation activities were measured at three time points: in July 2014, 2015, and 2016.
   The findings generally correspond to those observed in the large-scale studies of medical papers. Papers in renowned journals, and papers reporting clinical guidelines and multicentric studies had the most intense altmetric activity. In contrast, papers published in local, Croatian journals showed minimal altmetric activity, especially the papers published in Croatian. These results indicate that the local publishing community has not yet recognised social media as a tool for promoting research and that non-English language publications have minimal chances to receive attention, even in social media.
   The evaluative potential of altmetric indicators has to be further explored in a broader context.

AB This paper measures social media activities of 15 broad scientific disciplines indexed in Scopus database using Altmetric.com data. First, the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database is investigated, overall and across disciplines. Second, a zero-truncated negative binomial model is used to determine the association of various factors with increasing or decreasing citations. Lastly, the effectiveness of altmetric indices to identify publications with high citation impact is comprehensively evaluated by deploying area under the curve (AUC)-an application of receiver operating characteristic. Results indicate a rapid increase in the presence of Altmetric.com data in Scopus database from 10.19% in 2011 to 20.46% in 2015. It was found that Blog count was the most important factor in the field of Health Professions and Nursing as it increased the number of citations by 38.6%, followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field of Physics and Astronomy. The results of receiver operating characteristic show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC = 0.725 between highly cited publications and total altmetric count. Overall, findings suggest that altmetrics can be used to distinguish highly cited publications. The implications of this research are significant in many different directions. Firstly, they set the basis for a further investigation of altmetrics efficiency to predict publications impact and most significantly promote new insights for the measurement of research outcome dissemination over social media.

AB The quality and impact of scientific research is traditionally measured by citation-based metrics. However, the internet and social media revolution has led to radical changes in the way scientific information is shared and how it impacts the world. Alternative metrics (altmetrics) is a rapidly evolving measure to quantify social media attention received by a scientific work. It is a complement to the conventional metrics, and has tremendous potential in enabling faster alternative ways of evaluating research impact.

AB ObjectivesTo identify the most discussed dental articles on the Web and to assess the association between the intensity of online attention, publication characteristics, and citations.
   Materials and methodsAn Altmetric Explorer search was conducted for articles published in the 91 dental journals included in 2015 InCites Journal Citation Report((R)) and mentioned online at all times. The 100 articles with the highest online attention, as measured by the Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), were screened for journal title, quartile of impact factor distribution (Q1-Q4), publication date, origin and affiliation of first author, article topic, type, and access. Citation counts were harvested from Scopus.
   ResultsThe top 100 articles presented a median AAS of 119 and were mostly discussed on news outlets, Twitter, and Mendeley. Forty-one articles were published in Q1 journals, 24 in Q2 journals, 32 in Q3 journals, and three in Q4 journals. AAS was significantly higher in articles of Q2 journals (median AAS=398, range=70-513) than in articles of Q1. A weak reverse correlation existed between AAS and time since publication (r=-.25, p<.05). No correlation was detected between AAS and other publication characteristics or number of citations.
   ConclusionsIncreased social impact of dental articles is not significantly associated with high citation rates.

AB Research policy makers, funding agencies, universities and government organizations evaluate research output or impact based on the traditional citation count, peer review, h-index and journal impact factors. These impact measures also known as bibliometric indicators are limited to the academic community and cannot provide the broad perspective of research impact in public, government or business. The understanding that scholarly impact outside scientific and academic sphere has given rise to an area of scientometrics called alternative metrics or "altmetrics.'' Moreover, researchers in this area incline to center around gauging scientific activity via social media, namely Twitter. However, these count-based measurements of impact are sensitive to gaming as they lack concrete references to the primary source. In this work, we expand a conventional citation graph to a heterogeneous graph of publications, scientists, venues, organizations based on more reliable social media sources such as mainstream news and weblogs. Our method is composed of two components: the first one is combining the bibliometric data with social media data like blogs and mainstream news. The second component investigates how standard graph-based metrics can be applied to a heterogeneous graph to predict the academic impact. Our result showed moderate correlations and positive associations between the computed graph-based metrics with academic impact and also reasonably predict the academic impact of researchers.

AB During a week-long celebration of science, run under the federally supported National Science Week umbrella, the Catch a Rising Star: women in Queensland research (CaRS) programme flew scientists who identify as women to nine regional and remote communities in the Australian State of Queensland. The aim of the project was twofold: first, to bring science to remote and regional communities in a large, economically diverse state; and second, to determine whether media and public engagement provides career advancement opportunities for women scientists. This paper focuses on the latter goal. The data show: (i) a substantial majority (greater than 80%) of researchers thought the training and experience provided by the programme would help develop her career as a research scientist in the future, (ii) the majority (65%) thought the programme would help relate her research to end users, industry partners or stakeholders in the future, and (iii) analytics can help create a compelling narrative around engagement metrics and help to quantify influence. During the week-long project, scientists reached 600 000 impressions on one social media platform (Twitter) using a program hashtag. The breadth and depth of the project outcomes indicate funding bodies and employers could use similar data as an informative source of metrics to support hiring and promotion decisions. Although this project focused on researchers who identify as women, the lessons learned are applicable to researchers representing a diverse range of backgrounds. Future surveys will help determine whether the CaRS programme provided long-term career advantages to participating scientists and communities.

DE Altmetrics; Citation analysis; Library and Information Science;

ID ARTICLES; REFERENCES
AB Wikipedia citations have been suggested as a metric that partially captures the impact of research, providing an indication of the transfer of scholarly output to a wider audience beyond the academic community. In this article, we explore the coverage of Library and Information Science literature published between 2001 and 2010 in Wikipedia, paying special attention to the methodological issues involved in counting Wikipedia citations. The results reveal severe limitations in the use of Wikipedia citations for research evaluation. Lack of standardization and incompleteness of Wikipedia references make it difficult to retrieve them. The number of Wikipedia citations is very low, with less than 3% of articles in the sample having been cited. A significant number of references are cited in biographical entries about the authors of the articles, resulting in a phenomenon of accumulated advantage, which is similar to the Matthew effect. Nearly one-third of the Wikipedia citations link to an open access source, although this result is probably an underestimate of open access availability, given the incompleteness of Wikipedia citations.

AB Purpose
   To complement traditional citation-based metrics, which take years to accrue and indicate only academic attention, academia has begun considering altmetrics or alternative metrics, which provide timely feedback on an article's impact by tracking its dissemination via nontraditional outlets, such as blogs and social media, across audiences. This article describes altmetrics and examines altmetrics attention, outlets used, and top article characteristics for health professions education (HPE) research.
   Method
   Using Altmetric Explorer, a tool to search altmetrics activity, the authors searched for HPE articles that had at least one altmetrics event (e.g., an article was tweeted or featured in a news story) between 2011 and 2015. Retrieved articles were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In addition, the 10 articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Scores were identified and their key characteristics extracted.
   Results
   The authors analyzed 6,265 articles with at least one altmetrics event from 13 journals. Articles appeared in 14 altmetrics outlets. Mendeley (161,470 saves), Twitter (37,537 tweets), and Facebook (1,650 posts) were most popular. The number of HPE articles with altmetrics attention increased 145%, from 539 published in 2011 to 1,321 in 2015. In 2015, 50% or more of the articles in 5 journals received altmetrics attention. Themes for articles with the most altmetrics attention included social media or social networking; three such articles were written as tips or guides.
   Conclusions
   Increasing altmetrics attention signals interest in HPE research and the need for further investigation. Knowledge of popular and underused outlets may help investigators strategically share research for broader dissemination.

AB Who among the many researchers is most likely to usher in a new era of scientific breakthroughs? This question is of critical importance to universities, funding agencies, as well as scientists who must compete under great pressure for limited amounts of research money. Citations are the current primary means of evaluating one's scientific productivity and impact, and while often helpful, there is growing concern over the use of excessive self-citations to help build sustainable careers in science. Incorporating superfluous self-citations in one's writings requires little effort, receives virtually no penalty, and can boost, albeit artificially, scholarly impact and visibility, which are both necessary for moving up the academic ladder. Such behavior is likely to increase, given the recent explosive rise in popularity of web-based citation analysis tools (Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Altmetric) that rank research performance. Here, we argue for new metrics centered on transparency to help curb this form of self-promotion that, if left unchecked, can have a negative impact on the scientific workforce, the way that we publish new knowledge, and ultimately the course of scientific advance.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Background: Health care providers value ready access to reliable synthesized information to support point-of-care decision making. Web-based communities, facilitated by the adoption of social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are increasingly being used for knowledge dissemination, bridging the gap between knowledge generation and synthesis and knowledge implementation.
   Objective: Our objective was to implement and evaluate a structured social media strategy, using multiple platforms, to disseminate Cochrane Child Health evidence to health care providers caring for children.
   Methods: Our social media strategy had three components: daily "tweets" using the Cochrane Child Health Twitter account, weekly WordPress blog posts, and a monthly journal club on Twitter ("tweet chat"). Each tweet, blog, and journal club shared Cochrane evidence on a child health topic. We evaluated the strategy through (1) Twitter and blog site analytics, (2) traceable link (Bitly) statistics, (3) Altmetric. com scores for promoted evidence, and (4) participant feedback. We also tracked the resources required to write the blog, tweet content, and manage the strategy.
   Results: The 22-week social media strategy ran between November 2014 and April 2015. We created 25 blog posts, sent 585 tweets, and hosted 3 tweet chats. Monthly blog visits and views and Twitter account followers increased over time. During the study period, the blog received 2555 visitors and 3967 page views from a geographically diverse audience of health care providers, academics, and health care organizations. In total, 183 traceable Bitly links received 3463 clicks, and the Twitter account gained 469 new followers. The most visited and viewed blog posts included gastrointestinal topics (lactose avoidance), research on respiratory conditions (honey for cough and treatments for asthma), and maternal newborn care (skin-to-skin contact). On Twitter, popular topics were related to public health (vaccination) and pain management. We collected Altmetric. com scores for 61 studies promoted during the study period and recorded an average increase of 11 points. Research staff (n= 3) contributed approximately 433 hours to promotion activities and planning (6.5 hours each per week) to implement the social media strategy, and study investigators reviewed all content (blog posts and tweets).
   Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence on the use of a coordinated social media strategy for the dissemination of evidence to professionals providing health services to children and youth. The results and lessons learned from our study provide guidance for future knowledge dissemination activities using social media tools.

AB Social media use has increased both in the general public and in the surgical profession. A variety of social media platforms have been used, with Twitter being one of the most common and interactive platforms. Common uses by surgeons and scientists for social media include dissemination of information, information exchange, education, research recruitment, community consultation for clinical trials, and hospital or surgeon ratings. As social media use increases, a new language as well as metrics has been developed to track impact and reach of research incorporating social media platforms. All surgeons should be encouraged to familiarize themselves with social media, regardless of whether or not they choose to actively engage in it.

AB Ours will be the generation proud to say we shifted the sands of educational deserts by open access and proliferation, seeding of data sharing, and watering grassroots research in resource-compromised environments. Universal "social" media is defining features of modern professional life that provide powerful modes of knowledge acquisition/sharing to that end. Altmetric and other measurements stratify academic communications according to this alternate, online media presence (not academic penetrance). Are they meaningless, self-absorbed integers, or reliable yardsticks of scientific and educational prowess? Far beyond this trite, patronizing question from the minds of outdated, terrified technophobes, the real impact of "social" media is not narcissistic solipsism. Instant dissemination of contemporary surgical controversies on a truly global level drives improved (or at least reflective) health care for all. While a numerical assignment of value according to views, "likes," impressions, or "retweets" may seem meaningless to cynical, established academics, the impetus for universal improvement is self-evident. Electronic data and opinion sharing may not balance the inequity between low- and high-income countries, but it keeps it in perspective. The best way to shift desert sands is to blow on them constantly.

AB The lack of a representative scientific workforce is a challenge being addressed by federal agencies, funding bodies, and research institutes. As organizational units emphasize the work of training, recruiting, retaining, and promoting an inclusive scientific body, issues around bias and metrics appear frequently in the literature. The goal of this manuscript is to introduce some of the most commonly misunderstood areas of bias, and ways to adjust hiring and promotion practices; and to focus on innovative ways to quantify scientific outputs through metrics other than journal impact factors and paper citation numbers. These alternative metrics, or altmetrics, are increasingly reliable predictors of impact for a scientific community that is asked to engage more frequently and more effectively with the public. Additionally, we address discipline-specific concerns around metrics used for hiring and promotion in biosecurity and biosafety, taxonomy, and researchers in government and regulatory roles. We conclude that in the future, societal and scholarly impact will be more closely tied. This is a critical time to ensure scientists are adequately trained and recognized for their contributions as public intellectuals, and supported in this important work.

AB Social media has revolutionized the way research and museum collections communicate with the general public by disseminating knowledge and information in real time. Currently there are limited studies examining the use of social media by museums and entomological collections to engage the general public online. Social media has the power to promote museum and collection events, research, and staff, as well as raise awareness of entomological collections and demonstrate their relevance to the public, industry, policy makers, and potential students of entomology. Here we introduce SCOPE, a new framework for promoting museums and entomological collections using social media. The SCOPE framework streamlines strategy development, content choice, refinement of online engagement, choice of social media platform, and evaluation of social media campaigns using altmetrics. Case studies from the Australian National Insect Collection, CSIRO, and National Museums Scotland following the SCOPE framework are provided so that other museums, entomological collections, staff, and students can replicate it to develop and maintain their own social media presence.

TI Newsworthiness vs scientific impact: are the most highly cited urology
   papers the most widely disseminated in the media?
SO BJU INTERNATIONAL

ID CITATION-CLASSICS; TWITTER; LEVEL
AB Objective
   To assess whether a correlation exists between newsworthiness (Altmetric score) and scientific impact markers, such as citation analysis, impact factors, and levels of evidence.
   Methods
   The top five most cited articles for the year 2014 and 2015 from the top 10 ranking urology journals (Scientific Impact Group) were identified. The top 50 articles each in 2014 and 2015 were identified from Altmetric support based on media activity (Media Impact Group). We determined the number of citations that these articles received in the scientific literature, and calculated correlations between citations with Altmetric scores.
   Results
   In the Scientific Impact Group, the mean number of citations per article was 37.6, and the most highly cited articles were oncology guidelines. The mean Altmetric score in these articles was 14.8. There was a weak positive correlation between citations and Altmetric score (r(s) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.52, P < 0.001). In the Media Impact Group, the mean Altmetric score was 121.1 and most widely shared articles all related to sexual medicine. In this group, the mean number of citations was 9.7 and there was a weak negative correlation between Altmetric score and citations (r(s) = -0.20, P = 0.046).
   Conclusion
   The top articles based on Altmetric scores were not highly cited, suggesting that publications receiving the most media attention may not be the most scientifically rigorous, or that this audience places greater value on different subjects than the scientific community.

AB Social media platform makes more and more influence on academic communication with the development of web 2.0 + technology. Wechat (WeiXin in Chinese) is one of the social media tools based on social media platform to publicly communicate about research developments and finds for academics. The development of Wechat not only enriches the development of social media tools but also provides a new perspective and method for the evaluation of academic influence. The traditional metrics are not necessarily immediate feedback or reproducible, which are based on citation methods of evaluating and filtering articles. Wechat as one of the popular social media tools, which can provide possibility to make impact evaluation as a novel and promising approach to supplement the traditional citation metrics. Wechat not only can support the social influence for non-academic findings, but also provide academic impact of scholarships. The proposed Wechat index may be a useful and timely metric to measure uptake of research findings with public in real time. In short, Wechat is greatly supplement the offline methods of research dissemination and networking.

AB Our objective was to study the relationship between the design and content of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and the subsequent number of citations in the medical literature and attention in online news and social media. We studied RCTs published during 2014 in five highly cited medical journals. This was a retrospective review focusing on characteristics of the individual trials and measures of citation and lay media attention. Primary outcome measures included citation count and Altmetric((R)) scores (a composite score measuring attention in news, blogs, Twitter((R)), and Facebook((R))). Two hundred and forty two RCTs were included in the final analysis. Trial characteristics that were positive predictors of citation count included investigation of Hepatitis C treatment (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), private funding (r = 0.24, p < 0.001), mortality-related endpoint (r = 0.22, p < 0.001), and research setting within the United States (r = 0.13, p < 0.001). The trial characteristic that positively predicted Altmetric score was the population size potentially affected (r = 0.39, p < 0.001). The only negative predictor of citation count was the size of the population potentially affected (r = -0.21, p < 0.001). Negative predictors of the Altmetric score included investigation of Hepatitis C treatment (r = -0.21, p < 0.001) and private funding (r = -0.13, p < 0.001). While correlation magnitudes were weak, the predictors of biomedical literature citation and non-academic media coverage were different. These predictors may affect editorial decisions and, given the rising influence of health journalism, further study is warranted.

AB The Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of China has set forth ambitious goals, as part of its Citation Impact Upgrading Plan (CIUP), to fortify the standing of Chinese academics as well as Chinese academic journals. At present, MOST primarily considers Clarivate Analytics journal impact factor (JIF), which is a proprietary scientometric measure, as a measure of "quality". Academic publishing is however, starting to move away from metrics such as the JIF that can be gamed, and that do not truly reflect the academic worth of individual scientists, or of journals. Metrics such as altmetrics, which show the paper's popularity among social media, or a greater balance of metrics, to buffer the monopolized impact of the JIF on metrics-based rewards systems, may be issues that China and MOST need to consider as global academic publishing tends towards a state of open science where open access journals that reach a wider audience may have greater value than journals with a high JIF. Not only are China's academics well-funded by the state, the Chinese academic market is a highly coveted market by publishers and other parties interested in advancing their academic or commercial interests. Given the current fluid and rapidly evolving state of academic publishing, and the fairly rigid JIF-based rewards system in place in China at the moment, coupled with a recent spate in academic misconduct from Chinese researchers, this letter offers some suggestions as to the need for China to rethink its policies regarding what factors influence academic rewards.

AB Enthusiasm for using Twitter as a source of data in the social sciences extends to measuring the impact of research with Twitter data being a key component in the new altmetrics approach. In this paper, we examine tweets containing links to research articles in the field of dentistry to assess the extent to which tweeting about scientific papers signifies engagement with, attention to, or consumption of scientific literature. The main goal is to better comprehend the role Twitter plays in scholarly communication and the potential value of tweet counts as traces of broader engagement with scientific literature. In particular, the pattern of tweeting to the top ten most tweeted scientific dental articles and of tweeting by accounts is examined. The ideal that tweeting about scholarly articles represents curating and informing about state-of-the-art appears not to be realized in practice. We see much presumably human tweeting almost entirely mechanical and devoid of original thought, no evidence of conversation, tweets generated by monomania, duplicate tweeting from many accounts under centralized professional management and tweets generated by bots. Some accounts exemplify the ideal, but they represent less than 10% of tweets. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from twitter data is swamped by the mechanical nature of the bulk of tweeting behavior. In light of these results, we discuss the compatibility of Twitter with the research enterprise as well as some of the financial incentives behind these patterns.

AB With the growth of scholarly collaboration networks and social communication platforms, members of the scholarly community are experimenting with their approach to disseminating research outputs, in an effort to increase their audience and outreach. However, from a researcher's point of view, it is difficult to determine whether efforts to make work more visible are worthwhile (in terms of the association with publication metrics) and within that, difficult to assess which platform or network is most effective for sharing work and connecting to a wider audience. We undertook a case study of Kudos (https://www.growkudos.com), a web-based service that claims to help researchers increase the outreach of their publications, to examine the most effective tools for sharing publications online, and to investigate which actions are associated with improved metrics. We extracted a dataset from Kudos of 830,565 unique publications claimed by authors, for which 20,775 had actions taken to explain or share via Kudos, and for 4,867 of these full text download data from publishers was available. Findings show that researchers are most likely to share their work on Face-book, but links shared on Twitter are more likely to be clicked on. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that a treatment group (publications having actions in Kudos) had a significantly higher median average of 149 full text downloads (23.1% more) per publication as compared to a control group (having no actions in Kudos) with a median average of 121 full text downloads per publication. These findings suggest that performing actions on publications, such as sharing, explaining, or enriching, could help to increase the number of full text downloads of a publication.

AB SlideShare is a free social website that aims to help users distribute and find presentations. Owned by LinkedIn since 2012, it targets a professional audience but may give value to scholarship through creating a long-term record of the content of talks. This article tests this hypothesis by analyzing sets of general and scholarly related SlideShare documents using content and citation analysis and popularity statistics reported on the site. The results suggest that academics, students, and teachers are a minority of SlideShare uploaders, especially since 2010, with most documents not being directly related to scholarship or teaching. About two thirds of uploaded SlideShare documents are presentation slides, with the remainder often being files associated with presentations or video recordings of talks. SlideShare is therefore a presentation-centered site with a predominantly professional user base. Although a minority of the uploaded SlideShare documents are cited by, or cite, academic publications, probably too few articles are cited by SlideShare to consider extracting SlideShare citations for research evaluation. Nevertheless, scholars should consider SlideShare to be a potential source of academic and nonacademic information, particularly in library and information science, education, and business.

AB ResearchGate has launched its own citation index by extracting citations from documents uploaded to the site and reporting citation counts on article profile pages. Since authors may upload preprints to ResearchGate, it may use these to provide early impact evidence for new papers. This article assesses the whether the number of citations found for recent articles is comparable to other citation indexes using 2675 recently-published library and information science articles. The results show that in March 2017, ResearchGate found less citations than did Google Scholar but more than both Web of Science and Scopus. This held true for the dataset overall and for the six largest journals in it. ResearchGate correlated most strongly with Google Scholar citations, suggesting that ResearchGate is not predominantly tapping a fundamentally different source of data than Google Scholar. Nevertheless, preprint sharing in ResearchGate is substantial enough for authors to take seriously.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA; ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY; H-INDEX; TWITTER; OPPORTUNITY; PROGRAM
AB Rationale and Objectives: Emerging alternative metrics leverage social media and other online platforms to provide immediate measures of biomedical articles' reach among diverse public audiences. We aimed to compare traditional citation and alternative impact metrics for articles in popular general radiology journals.
   Materials and Methods: All 892 original investigations published in 2013 issues of Academic Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, Journal of the American College of Radiology, and Radiology were included. Each article's content was classified as imaging vs nonimaging. Traditional journal citations to articles were obtained from Web of Science. Each article's Altmetric Attention Score (Altmetric), representing weighted mentions across a variety of online platforms, was obtained from Altmetric.com. Statistical assessment included the McNemar test, the Mann-Whitney test, and the Pearson correlation.
   Results: Mean and median traditional citation counts were 10.7 +/- 15.4 and 5 vs 3.3 +/- 13.3 and 0 for Altmetric. Among all articles, 96.4% had traditional citation vs 41.8% for Altmetric (P < 0.001). Online platforms for which at least 5% of the articles were represented included Mendeley (42.8%), Twitter (34.2%), Facebook (10.7%), and news outlets (8.4%). Citations and Altmetric were weakly correlated (r = 0.20), with only a 25.0% overlap in terms of articles within their top 10th percentiles. Traditional citations were higher for articles with imaging vs nonimaging content (11.5 +/- 16.2 vs 6.9 +/- 9.8, P < 0.001), but Altmetric scores were higher in articles with nonimaging content (5.1 +/- 11.1 vs 2.8 +/- 13.7, P = 0.006).
   Conclusions: Although overall online attention to radiology journal content was low, alternative metrics exhibited unique trends, particularly for nonclinical articles, and may provide a complementary measure of radiology research impact compared to traditional citation counts.

AB In this study we examined who tweeted academic articles that had at least one Finnish author or co-author affiliation and that had high altmetric counts on Twitter. In this investigation of national level altmetrics we chose the most tweeted scientific articles from four broad areas of science (Agricultural, Engineering and Technological Sciences; Medical and Health Sciences; Natural Sciences; Social Sciences and Humanities). By utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis, we studied the data using research techniques such as keyword categorization, co-word analysis and content analysis of user profile descriptions. Our results show that contrary to a random sample of Twitter users, users who tweet academic articles describe themselves more factually and by emphasizing their occupational expertise rather than personal interests. The more field-specific the articles were, the more research-related descriptions dominated in Twitter profile descriptions. We also found that scientific articles were tweeted to promote ideological views especially in instances where the article represented a topic that divides general opinion.

ID ALTMETRICS
AB Counts of Mendeley readers may give useful evidence about the impact of published research. Although previous studies have found significant positive correlations between counts of Mendeley readers and citation counts for journal articles, it is not known if this is equally true for conference papers. To fill this gap, Mendeley readership data and Scopus citation counts were extracted for both journal articles and conference papers published in 2011 in four fields for which conferences are important: Computer Science Applications; Computer Software; Building and Construction Engineering; and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Mendeley readership counts correlated moderately with citation counts for both journal articles and conference papers in Computer Science Applications and Computer Software. The correlations were much lower between Mendeley readers and citation counts for conference papers than for journal articles in Building & Construction Engineering and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Hence, there seem to be disciplinary differences in the usefulness of Mendeley readership counts as impact indicators for conference papers, even between fields for which conferences are important.

   measurement; MNRS; broader impact
ID BROADER IMPACT; INDICATORS; METRICS; READER; INDEX
AB Bibliometrics is successful in measuring impact because the target is clearly defined: the publishing scientist who is still active and working. Thus, citations are a target-oriented metric which measures impact on science. In contrast, societal impact measurements based on altmetrics are as a rule intended to measure impact in a broad sense on all areas of society (e.g. science, culture, politics, and economics). This tendency is especially reflected in the efforts to design composite indicators (e.g. the Altmetric Attention Score). We deem appropriate that not only the impact measurement using citations is target-oriented (citations measure the impact of papers on scientists) but also the measurement of impact using altmetrics. Impact measurements only make sense, if the target group-the recipient of academic papers-is clearly defined. Thus, we extend in this study the field-normalized reader impact indicator proposed by us in an earlier study, which is based on Mendeley data (the mean normalized reader score, MNRS), to a target-oriented field-normalized impact indicator (e.g. MNRSED measures reader impact on the sector of educational donation, i.e. teaching). This indicator can show-as demonstrated in empirical examples-the ability of journals, countries, and academic institutions to publish papers which are below or above the average impact of papers on a specific sector in society (e.g. the educational or teaching sector). Thus, the method allows to measure the impact of scientific papers on certain groups-controlling for the field in which the papers have been published and their publication year.

AB This study identifies the presence, productivity and influence of Ibero-American authors that write about information literacy (InfoLit). Using bibliometric and altmetric indicators, it seeks to analyze the impact and subsequent use of their scholarly works on social and scientific platforms. Fifty-five authors with the highest productivity were identified, based on the results of bibliometric studies on InfoLit carried out on both an international and Ibero-American scale in searches of major databases as well as publications collected in a Latin American wiki. Subsequently an analysis of bibliometric and altmetric indicators at the author and publication level was carried out, based on the results of searches on eight scientific platforms (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia. edu, Mendeley, ORCID, IraLIS, E-LIS and EXIT), three social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and data provided by a commercial supplier (Altmetric. com). Overall we found a greater presence of authors in ResearchGate (58%), Academia. edu (51%) and Google Scholar (49%) as opposed to Mendeley (25%) and ORCID (18%). Furthermore, as to social platforms, the greatest potential influence lies with Facebook, due to its high number of followers (/top 10 authors). In addition, an analysis with the Spearman rho statistic, shows among some sources and platforms, a low correlation between the number of citations in Google Scholar and readings in Mendeley (r = 382) and low negative for mentions in blogs (r = 0,-237), Google+ (r = 0, -214) and Twitter (r = 0, -183). In conclusion, both the productivity and the impact-visibility center on specific authors writing about InfoLit, and various measurement resources show that for these authors there is a positive two-way impact from bibliometric to altmetric and vice versa.

AB In this study usage counts and times cited from Web of Science Core Collection (WoS) were collected for articles published in 2013 with Belgian, Israeli and Iranian addresses. We investigated the relations among three indicators related to citation impact, usage counts and co-authorship, respectively. In addition, we applied the method of Characteristic Scores and Scales (CSS) to analyse the distributions of citations and usage counts to further test the relation between the usage and citation impact. The results show that citations and usage counts in WoS correlate significantly, especially in the social sciences. However, higher numbers of co-authors are not associated with higher usage counts or citations. Furthermore, the stability of CSS-class distributions substantiates the applicability of CSS in characterising both usage and citation distributions. Distinctly different patterns in citations and usage are observed, but the similarities within citations and usage in these fields are somewhat unexpected.

AB The academic social network site ResearchGate (RG) has its own indicator, RG Score, for its members. The high profile nature of the site means that the RG Score may be used for recruitment, promotion and other tasks for which researchers are evaluated. In response, this study investigates whether it is reasonable to employ the RG Score as evidence of scholarly reputation. For this, three different author samples were investigated. An outlier sample includes 104 authors with high values. A Nobel sample comprises 73 Nobel winners from Medicine and Physiology, Chemistry, Physics and Economics (from 1975 to 2015). A longitudinal sample includes weekly data on 4 authors with different RG Scores. The results suggest that high RG Scores are built primarily from activity related to asking and answering questions in the site. In particular, it seems impossible to get a high RG Score solely through publications. Within RG it is possible to distinguish between (passive) academics that interact little in the site and active platform users, who can get high RG Scores through engaging with others inside the site (questions, answers, social networks with influential researchers). Thus, RG Scores should not be mistaken for academic reputation indicators.

   on Twitter
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
AB Twitter communication has permeated every sphere of society. To highlight and share small pieces of information with possibly vast audiences or small circles of the interested has some value in almost any aspect of social life. But what is the value exactly for a scientific field? We perform a comprehensive study of computer scientists using Twitter and their tweeting behavior concerning the sharing of web links. Discerning the domains, hosts and individual web pages being tweeted and the differences between computer scientists and a Twitter sample enables us to look in depth at the Twitter-based information sharing practices of a scientific community. Additionally, we aim at providing a deeper understanding of the role and impact of altmetrics in computer science and give a glance at the publications mentioned on Twitter that are most relevant for the computer science community. Our results show a link sharing culture that concentrates more heavily on public and professional quality information than the Twitter sample does. The results also show a broad variety in linked sources and especially in linked publications with some publications clearly related to community-specific interests of computer scientists, while others with a strong relation to attention mechanisms in social media. This refers to the observation that Twitter is a hybrid form of social media between an information service and a social network service. Overall the computer scientists' style of usage seems to be more on the information- oriented side and to some degree also on professional usage. Therefore, altmetrics are of considerable use in analyzing computer science.

DE Altmetrics; citation analysis; Mendeley
ID METRICS; IMPACT
AB Counts of citations to academic articles are widely used as indicators of their scholarly impact. In addition, alternative indicators derived from social websites have been proposed to cover some of the shortcomings of citation counts. The most promising such indicator is counts of readers of an article in the social reference sharing site Mendeley. Although Mendeley reader counts tend to correlate strongly and positively with citation counts within scientific fields, an understanding of causes of citation-reader anomalies is needed before Mendeley reader counts can be used with confidence as indicators. In response, this article proposes a list reasons for anomalies based upon an analysis of articles that are highly cited but have few Mendeley readers, or vice versa. The results show that there are both technical and legitimate reasons for differences, with the latter including communities that use research but do not cite it in Scopus-indexed publications or do not use Mendeley. The results also suggest that the lower of the two values (citation counts, reader counts) tends to underestimate of the impact of an article and so taking the maximum is a reasonable strategy for a combined impact indicator.

DE research impact metrics; altmetrics; alternative metrics
AB The prestige of publication has been based on traditional citation metrics, most commonly journal impact factor. However, the Internet has radically changed the speed, flow, and sharing of medical information. Furthermore, the explosion of social media, along with development of popular professional and scientific websites and blogs, has led to the need for alternative metrics, known as altmetrics, to quantify the wider impact of research. We explore the evolution of current research impact metrics and examine the evolving role of altmetrics in measuring the wider impact of research. We suggest that altmetrics used in research evaluation should be part of an informed peer-review process such as traditional metrics. Moreover, results based on altmetrics must not lead to direct decision making about research, but instead, should be used to assist experts in making decisions. Finally, traditional and alternative metrics should complement, not replace, each other in the peer-review process.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether specific title characteristics could influence the likelihood of being included in the "Altmetric Top 100."
   Methods: We conducted a 1:2 matched case control study with the cases being the health care articles included in the "Altmetric Top 100" lists (2013-2015) matched through a random computerized procedure with two health care articles published in the same journal and year. For each title, we extracted the number of characters in the title, the number of uncommon words, and whether the title was declarative. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for a prespecified baseline confounder (open access).
   Results: One hundred eight "Medical and health sciences" articles were retrieved in the 2013-2015 "Altmetric Top 100" and matched to 216 control articles. Titles of the "Altmetric Top 100" articles were 102.6 characters (+/- 42) long, included 3.4 (+/- 2.0) uncommon words, and 29.6% (32/108) were "declarative." Titles of the matched articles were 109.3 characters (+/- 37.1) long, included 4.7 (+/- 2.4) uncommon words, and 21.8% (47/216) were "declarative." After multivariate adjustment, declarative titles with a lower number of uncommon words were significantly more represented in the Altmetric list, with declarative titles having 2.8 times the odds of being in the top list (OR: 2.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 6.4). For each additional uncommon word in the title, there was a 1.4 increase in the odds of being a non-Altmetric Top 100 article (1.4; 1.2-1.6).
   Conclusion: An easy-to-understand, informative title may help bridge the gap between scholar and social media dissemination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Local altmetrics is currently an integral part of the altmetrics landscape. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of microblog altmetrics of the Chinese microblog platform, Weibo, to shed light on cultural differences and draw attention to local altmetrics in developing countries. The analysis is based on 4.4 million records provided by Altmetric.com. Data collected are from March 2014 to July 2015. It is found that Weibo users discuss global science, more actively compared with several international altmetrics sources. Statistical results show strong evidence of the immediacy advantage of metrics based on Weibo as well as Twitter and the general altmetrics over citations. Distribution of Weibo altmetrics on the article level, source level and discipline level are highly skewed. Overall, compared with Twitter, Weibo altmetrics present similar distributions, with some minor variations. To better understand how and why Weibo users discuss global scientific articles, the top weiboed articles, sources and disciplines are identified and further explored. Our content analysis shows that the common motivation of scientific weibos is to disseminate or discuss the articles because they are interesting, surprising, academically useful or practically useful. Conclusion of articles is the most frequently mentioned element in scientific weibos. In addition, different from Twitter, Weibo users have a preference for traditional prestigious journals.

AB The ever-growing number of venues publishing academic work makes it difficult for researchers to identify venues that publish data and research most in line with their scholarly interests. A solution is needed, therefore, whereby researchers can identify information dissemination pathways in order to both access and contribute to an existing body of knowledge. In this study, we present a system to recommend scholarly venues rated in terms of relevance to a given researcher's current scholarly pursuits and interests. We collected our data from an academic social network and modeled researchers' scholarly reading behavior in order to propose a new and adaptive implicit rating technique for venues. We present a way to recommend relevant, specialized scholarly venues using these implicit ratings that can provide quick results, even for new researchers without a publication history and for emerging scholarly venues that do not yet have an impact factor. We performed a large-scale experiment with real data to evaluate the current scholarly recommendation system and showed that our proposed system achieves better results than the baseline. The results provide important up-to-the-minute signals that compared with post-publication usage-based metrics represent a closer reflection of a researcher's interests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA; PROFESSIONALISM
AB Introduction To report and analyse Altmetric data of all dental articles and journals in 2015. Methods To identify all 2015 dental articles, PubMed was searched via Altmetric platform using the following query: ("2015/1/1"[PDAT]: "2015/12/31"[PDAT]) AND jsubsetd[text] NOT 2016[PDAT] on November 12, 2016. Altmetric data of all 2015 dental articles and journals were extracted and analysed by Microsoft Office Excel 2016 using descriptive statistics, graphs and trend-line analysis. To find the most important and influential Altmetric factors, multi-layered perceptron artificial neural network was employed using SPSS 22. Results A total of 14,884 dental articles published in 2015 using PubMed database were found, from which 5,153 (34.62%) articles had an Altmetric score. The mean Altmetric score was 2.94 +/- 9.2 (95% C.I: 2.703.22). Mendeley readers (73.19%), Twitter (21.48%), Facebook walls (3.67%), news outlets (0.69%) and bloggers (0.57%) were the most popular Altmetric data resources. At journal level, 147 dental journals with valid Altmetric data were included in the study. The British Dental Journal had the first rank, followed by Journal of Dental Research, Journal of Clinical Periodontology and Journal of the American Dental Association. Sensitivity analysis showed news outlets, tweeters and scientific bloggers were the most important and influential Altmetric data resources. Discussion In comparison with all science subjects and medical and health sciences, 2015 Altmetric scores in dentistry were very low. Uses of new and emerging scholarly tools such as social media, scientific blogs and post-publication peer-review were not common in the dental science. This negligence may be due to lack of knowledge and attitude. An Altmetric score is dynamic and may fluctuate over time.

AB Metrics derived from Twitter and other social media-often referred to as altmetrics-are increasingly used to estimate the broader social impacts of scholarship. Such efforts, however, may produce highly misleading results, as the entities that participate in conversations about science on these platforms are largely unknown. For instance, if altmetric activities are generated mainly by scientists, does it really capture broader social impacts of science? Here we present a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing scientists on Twitter. Our method can identify scientists across many disciplines, without relying on external bibliographic data, and be easily adapted to identify other stakeholder groups in science. We investigate the demographics, sharing behaviors, and interconnectivity of the identified scientists. We find that Twitter has been employed by scholars across the disciplinary spectrum, with an over-representation of social and computer and information scientists; under-representation of mathematical, physical, and life scientists; and a better representation of women compared to scholarly publishing. Analysis of the sharing of URLs reveals a distinct imprint of scholarly sites, yet only a small fraction of shared URLs are science-related. We find an assortative mixing with respect to disciplines in the networks between scientists, suggesting the maintenance of disciplinary walls in social media. Our work contributes to the literature both methodologically and conceptually-we provide new methods for disambiguating and identifying particular actors on social media and describing the behaviors of scientists, thus providing foundational information for the construction and use of indicators on the basis of social media metrics.

AB Despite their important position in the research environment, there is a growing theoretical uncertainty concerning what research metrics indicate (e.g., quality, impact, attention). Here we utilize the same tools used to study latent traits like Intelligence and Personality to get a quantitative understanding of what over 20 common research metrics indicate about the papers they represent. The sample is all of the 32,962 papers PLoS published in 2014, with results suggesting that there are at least two important underlying factors, which could generally be described as Scientific Attention/Discussion (citations), General Attention/Discussion (views, tweets), and potentially Media Attention/Discussion (media mentions). The General Attention metric is correlated about .50 with both the Academic and Media factors, though the Academic and Media attention are only correlated with each other below .05. The overall best indicator of the dataset was the total lifetime views on the paper, which is also probably the easiest to game. The results indicate the need for funding bodies to decide what they value and how to measure it (e.g., types of attention, quality).

AB Context of altmetrics data is essential for further understanding value of altmetrics beyond raw counts. Mainly two facets of context are explored, the count type which reflects user's multiple altmetrics behaviors and user category which reflects part of user's background. Based on 5.18 records provided by Altmetric.com, both descriptive statistics and t test result show significant difference between number of posts (NP) and number of unique users (NUU). For several altmetrics indicators, NP has moderate to low correlation with NUU. User category is found to have huge impact on altmetrics count. Analysis of twitter user category shows the general tweet distribution is strongly influenced by the public user. Tweets from research user are more correlated with citations than any other user categories. Moreover, disciplinary difference exists for different user categories.

AB To explore whether there are other factors than count and sentiment that should be incorporated in evaluating research papers with social media mentions, this paper analyses the content of tweets linking to the top 100 papers of 2015 taken from www.altmetric.com, focusing on the goals, functions and features of research. We discuss three basic issues inherent in using tweets for research evaluation: whose tweets can be used to assess a paper, what objects can be evaluated, and how to score the paper according to each tweet. We suggest that tweets written by those involved in publication of the paper in question should not be included in the paper's evaluation. Tweets unrelated to the content of the paper should also be excluded. Because controversies in research are inevitable and difficult to resolve, we suggest omitting somewhat supportive and negative tweets in research evaluation. Logically, neutral tweets (such as those linking to, and excerpts from, papers) express a degree of compliment, agreement, interest, or surprise, albeit less so than the tweets explicitly expressing these sentiments. Recommendation tweets also reflect one or more of these sentiments. Expansion tweets, which are inspired by the papers, reflect the function of research. Therefore, we suggest giving a higher weight to praise, agreement, interest, surprise, recommendation and expansion tweets linking to an academic paper than neutral tweets when scoring a paper. Issues related to electronic publishing and social media as learned from tweets are also discussed.

AB Social laboratories, defined as experimental spaces for co-creation, have recently become the main centers of innovation. Medialabs are experimental laboratories of technologies and communication media which have co-evolved along with the digital society into mediation laboratories of citizen experimentation, observing a confluence of both models. in recent years, these centers have expanded within the higher education context, generating new forms of innovation and posing the question of how to measure the impact of such open spaces. This paper analyzes the origin and development of social laboratories in Spain. it first reviews their historical development from their antecedents in the 19th Century to the most recent initiatives. it focuses specifically on initiatives launched within the university context, highlighting their role as motors of innovation. Then, it presents the case of Medialab UgR, a co-creation and digital culture center of social collaboration framed in the digital context. Finally, it offers a first approach towards the assessment of its social impact by using Twitter and analyzes its capacity to mobilize and reach non-academic audiences. The findings show the plurality of actors involved in this type of networks as well as the difficulty and complexity of the task for the development of indicators that can comprise both, academic and social interests.

AB In recent years, the relationship of collaboration among scientists and the citation impact of papers have been frequently investigated. Most of the studies show that the two variables are closely related: An increasing collaboration activity (measured in terms of number of authors, number of affiliations, and number of countries) is associated with an increased citation impact. However, it is not clear whether the increased citation impact is based on the higher quality of papers that profit from more than one scientist giving expert input or other (citation-specific) factors. Thus, the current study addresses this question by using two comprehensive data sets with publications (in the biomedical area) including quality assessments by experts (F1000Prime member scores) and citation data for the publications. The study is based on more than 15,000 papers. Robust regression models are used to investigate the relationship between number of authors, number of affiliations, and number of countries, respectively, and citation impact-controlling for the papers' quality (measured by F1000Prime expert ratings). The results point out that the effect of collaboration activities on impact is largely independent of the papers' quality. The citation advantage is apparently not quality related; citation-specific factors (e.g., self-citations) seem to be important here.

AB Hutchins, Yuan, Anderson, and Santangelo (2015) proposed the Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) as a new field-normalized impact indicator. This study investigates the RCR by correlating it on the level of single publications with established field-normalized indicators and assessments of the publications by peers. We find that the RCR correlates highly with established field-normalized indicators, but the correlation between RCR and peer assessments is only low to medium.

AB Research assessment in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) is delicate. Assessment procedures meet strong criticisms from SSH scholars and bibliometric research shows that the methods that are usually applied are ill-adapted to SSH research. While until recently research on assessment in the SSH disciplines focused on the deficiencies of the current assessment methods, we present some European initiatives that take a bottom-up approach. They focus on research practices in SSH and reflect on how to assess SSH research with its own approaches instead of applying and adjusting the methods developed for and in the natural and life sciences. This is an important development because we can learn from previous evaluation exercises that whenever scholars felt that assessment procedures were imposed in a top-down manner without proper adjustments to SSH research, it resulted in boycotts or resistance. Applying adequate evaluation methods not only helps foster a better valorization of SSH research within the research community, among policymakers and colleagues from the natural sciences, but it will also help society to better understand SSH's contributions to solving major societal challenges. Therefore, taking the time to encourage bottom-up evaluation initiatives should result in being able to better confront the main challenges facing modern society. This article is published as part of a collection on the future of research assessment.

TI Measuring scientific impact beyond academia: An assessment of existing

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID LEIDEN MANIFESTO; CITATION; ALTMETRICS
AB How does scientific research affect the world around us? Being able to answer this question is of great importance in order to appropriately channel efforts and resources in science. The impact by scientists in academia is currently measured by citation based metrics such as h-index, i-index and citation counts. These academic metrics aim to represent the dissemination of knowledge among scientists rather than the impact of the research on the wider world. In this work we are interested in measuring scientific impact beyond academia, on the economy, society, health and legislation (comprehensive impact). Indeed scientists are asked to demonstrate evidence of such comprehensive impact by authoring case studies in the context of the Research Excellence Framework (REF). We first investigate the extent to which existing citation based metrics can be indicative of comprehensive impact. We have collected all recent REF impact case studies from 2014 and we have linked these to papers in citation networks that we constructed and derived from CiteSeerX, arXiv and PubMed Central using a number of text processing and information retrieval techniques. We have demonstrated that existing citation-based metrics for impact measurement do not correlate well with REF impact results. We also consider metrics of online attention surrounding scientific works, such as those provided by the Altmetric API. We argue that in order to be able to evaluate wider non-academic impact we need to mine information from a much wider set of resources, including social media posts, press releases, news articles and political debates stemming from academic work. We also provide our data as a free and reusable collection for further analysis, including the PubMed citation network and the correspondence between REF case studies, grant applications and the academic literature.

AB Introduction. The concept of attention is applied in two altmetric studies concerning: (1) the use of social media tools on the web pages of scientific journals, and indications of attention in these pages received, and (2) attention received by the radio news on the web page of an indigenous radio station. The purpose is to reveal characteristics of web publications connected to the attention they receive.
   Method. Altmetric data describing attention data was compiled from the Facebook sites of scientific journals and the Facebook pages of an indigenous radio station news programme, as well as the news programme's web site. The study was both quantitative and qualitative.
   Analysis. Attention was operationalized in the form of comments, likes or sharing of Facebook postings and these were analyzed quantitatively. The contents of the postings were analysed by qualitative content analysis.
   Results. The characteristics of the postings receiving most attention were relevance, community (in the sense of ownership), belonging and co-creation, and engagement in the meaning of interactivity.
   Conclusions. In altmetric research, data originating from several sources can reflect the societal impact a project or a publication may have, not only the impact it has in science. Attention economy theory supports the interpretation of altmetric data.

AB Digital object identifiers (DOIs) were launched in 1997 to facilitate the longterm access and identification of objects in digital environments. The objective of the present investigation is to assess the DOI availability of articles in biomedical journals indexed in the PubMed database and to complete this investigation with a geographical analysis of journals by the country of publisher. Articles were randomly selected from PubMed using their PubMed identifier and were downloaded from and processed through developed Hypertext Preprocessor language scripts. The first part of the analysis focuses on the period 1966-2015 (50 years). Of the 496,665 articles studied over this period, 201,055 have DOIs (40.48%). Results showed that the percentage of articles with DOIs began to increase for articles published in the 2000s, with spectacular growth in the years 2002-2003, then reached a peak in 2015. Data on countries showed that some countries gradually implemented DOIs over the period 1966 to 2015 (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), while some did not (Russia, the Czech Republic, and Romania). The second part of the analysis focuses on the year 2015 and includes 268,790 articles published in 2015, randomly selected to evaluate the current implementation of DOIs. In 2015, 86.42% of articles had DOIs. The geographical analysis of countries of publishers showed that some countries (Russia, Thailand, and Ukraine) still assigned few DOIs to articles in 2015. Thus, if the scientific community aims to increase the number and the usefulness of services rendered by DOIs, efforts must be made to generalize their use by all persons involved in scientific publication, particularly publishers.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate and compare the social media (SM) impact of 273 South Africa Post-Secondary Education accredited journals, which are recognised by the Department of Higher Education and Training of South Africa for purposes of financial support. We used multiple sources to extract data for the study, namely, Altmetric. com, Google Scholar (GS), Scopus (through SCImago) and the Thomson Reuters (TR) Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Data was analysed to determine South African journals' presence in and impact on SM as well as to contrast SM visibility and impact with the citation impact in GS, JCR and Scopus. The Spearman correlation test was performed to compare the impact of the journals on SM and other sources. The results reveal that 2923 articles published in 122 of the 273 South African (SA) journals have received at least one mention in SM; the most commonly used SM platforms were Twitter and Facebook; the journals indexed in the TR's citation indexes and Scopus performed much better, in terms of their average altmetrics, than non-TR and non-Scopus indexed journals; and there were weak to moderate relationships among different types of altmetrics and citation-based measures, thereby implying different kinds of journal impacts on SM when compared to the scholarly impact reflected in citation databases. In conclusion, South African journals' impact on SM, just as is the case with countries with similar economies, is minimal but has shown signs of growth.

AB In this short communication, we provide an overview of a relatively newly provided source of altmetrics data which could possibly be used for societal impact measurements in scientometrics. Recently, Altmetric-a start-up providing publication level metrics-started to make data for publications available which have been mentioned in policy-related documents. Using data from Altmetric, we study how many papers indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) are mentioned in policy-related documents. We find that less than 0.5% of the papers published in different subject categories are mentioned at least once in policy-related documents. Based on our results, we recommend that the analysis of (WoS) publications with at least one policy-related mention is repeated regularly (annually) in order to check the usefulness of the data. Mentions in policy-related documents should not be used for impact measurement until new policy-related sites are tracked.

AB This paper proposes a multivariate model for the evaluation of international emergency medicine journals using the most widely used, efficient and representative productivity and citation indicators. This is a descriptive observational evaluation study based on a sample of 24 journals included in the emergency medicine category of the Journal Citation Reports 2015. The sample is evaluated based on seven evaluation indicators: Journal Citation Reports impact factor, three H-indices (Web of Science, Scimago and Google Scholar), the Scimago Journal Rank and two altmetric scores (3-month and any time). The bivariate correlations between the diverse distributions of evaluation indicators and a multivariate metric reliability index are calculated. The factorial structure of the indicators is explored and clusters of journals are defined. A factor score is assigned to each journal. The correlations between the seven evaluation indicators are high and statistically significant. The metric reliability of the multivariate analysis calculated using Cronbach's alpha is .97. A general factor explains the 84.64% variance of the factor space of the seven evaluation indicators, representing the 'quality of EM journals' construct. The most well-represented indicator, the one with the highest communality, is H_Index_WoS (h = .922), which is also the indicator with the greatest weight in the general factor (a = .96). The journals can be classified in four clusters according to their quality. A factor score is generated for each journal that could be used as a multivariate meta-index to evaluate journal quality and to define a ranking of journals.

AB Although altmetrics and other web-based alternative indicators are now commonplace in publishers' websites, they can be difficult for research evaluators to use because of the time or expense of the data, the need to benchmark in order to assess their values, the high proportion of zeros in some alternative indicators, and the time taken to calculate multiple complex indicators. These problems are addressed here by (a) a field normalisation formula, the Mean Normalised Log-transformed Citation Score (MNLCS) that allows simple confidence limits to be calculated and is similar to a proposal of Lundberg, (b) field normalisation formulae for the proportion of cited articles in a set, the Equalised Mean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (EMNPC) and the Mean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (MNPC), to deal with mostly uncited data sets, (c) a sampling strategy to minimise data collection costs, and (d) free unified software to gather the raw data, implement the sampling strategy, and calculate the indicator formulae and confidence limits. The approach is demonstrated (but not fully tested) by comparing the Scopus citations, Mendeley readers and Wikipedia mentions of research funded by Wellcome, NIH, and MRC in three large fields for 2013-2016. Within the results, statistically significant differences in both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts were found even for sets of articles that were less than six months old. Mendeley reader counts were more precise than Scopus citations for the most recent articles and all three funders could be demonstrated to have an impact in Wikipedia that was significantly above the world average.

AB When the meaning of key terms is incompatible in competing taxonomies, a revolution might occur in the field by which the established taxonomy is replaced with another. Since the key term "impact'' in scientometrics seems to undergo a taxonomic change, a revolution might be taking place at present: Impact is no longer defined as impact on science alone (measured by citations), but on all sectors of society (e.g. economics, culture, or politics). In this Short Communication, we outline that the current revolution in scientometrics does not only imply a broadening of the impact perspective, but also the devaluation of quality considerations in evaluative contexts. Impact might no longer be seen as a proxy for quality, but in its original sense: the simple resonance in some sectors of society.

AB With the emergence of Web 2.0, an online platform which encourages online creation of next generation tools, communication has become a nigh-indispensable tool for researchers. Allowing them to acquire, spread, and share research achievements, with a free flow of ideas online. At present, there are a growing number of studies on non-traditional evaluation indicators, but there is much fewer research focused on the software evaluation, especially for open source research software. What this research focuses on is; with the use of the open source project 'Depsy', this research evaluated and analyzed data collected from downloads made online through these open source software. Altmetrics cannot be confined to traditional measurable indicators. That the importance of the open source software used, and its position in the online community is itself a strong measure for academic impact and success, which is all too often overlooked in research. The research can also conclude that the multiplexing of software online, through the citation of a citation, ultimately leads to an online peered review system within the community, effectively developing and maintaining through open use software itself. Moreover, the benefits of such a system has only just begun to come to fruition, having a strong impact on academic research, and predicting research impact.

Citations appeared in Scopus, Google Scholar and scores appeared on Altmetric Explorer (Altmetrics) are extracted for comparison. The impact of highly cited Indian cancer research papers on Altmetric Explorer is negligible. The Indian cancer research is widely spread and published in multidisciplinary channels. Major cancer research is produced by few premier research institutes and reflection of highly cited papers in social media is negligible. Results of the study give an insight of Indian cancer research scenario to researchers, clinicians, policy makers to identify prolific institutes for collaborations and devise better cancer controlling policies.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the evolution in notions from bibliometrics to altmetrics and confront them taking into consideration specific criteria. The objective of this paper is to present the evolution of research, regarding the above fields, the study of metrics and indicators used, and the strength and weaknesses resulting from the current literature. Furthermore, the authors present the manipulation techniques for both fields as their main weakness, as well as further key points, analyzing the alternative options of bibliometrics and altmetrics.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the authors present the evolution of the literature, concerning the specific field and metrics used, following with a brief description of basic indicators related to the field of bibliometrics (journal impact factor (JIF), eigenfactor, article influence score and h-index) discussing their advantages and disadvantages. In the second part, the authors describe altmetrics and present the differences with bibliometrics.
   Findings - Both bibliometrics and altmetrics remain weak indicators as fraught with disadvantages with manipulation being the greatest of all. Nevertheless, the combination of the two is proposed in order to export safer conclusions on assessing the impact. Regarding the manipulation there is yet not a clean technique to eliminate manipulation. In specific, regarding bibliometrics, the manipulation of indicators refers only to the human factor intervention. The theoretical implication of this study constitutes of collecting the relevant literature regarding scientific indicators.
   Research limitations/implications -We must consider the study of new indicators, which combine metrics and methodologies used in both bibliometrics and altmetrics. The theoretical implication of this study constitutes of collecting the relevant literature regarding scientific indicators. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further.
   Practical implications - The practical contribution, on the other side, provides scholars with the knowledge of how making their work more accessible, increasing their impact.
   Originality/value - The authors add to the originality by providing a framework of the relevant literature for bibliometrics and altmetrics for future researchers. The authors describe altmetrics and present the differences with bibliometrics. The authors conclude the research with the implications of the conducted analysis and the potential directions for future research. Regarding manipulation, the authors provide with the techniques so researchers are aware of the methods in order to protect their academic profile.

The 378 articles published in the Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries (EJISDC) in the 14-year period 2000 to 2013 were examined. Results showed that all 378 articles were downloaded and had Mendeley readers. Of the 378 articles, 359 (94.97%) articles received Google Scholar citations and 19 (5.03%) articles received no citations. For the 359 cited articles, the average Google Scholar citations per article were 28.82. The average EJISDC downloads were 7440.69, the average Mendeley readership was 19.30 and Google Scholar citations were 27.36. The most influential articles in the EJISDC were identified by ranking and by comparing the top 20 articles by downloads, Mendeley readership and Google Scholar citations. The leading authors were identified using the top 20 ranking and comparing it to the most productive authors. For this journal, the results seem to indicate that the highest correlations (Spearman correlation coefficient) were between Google Scholar citations and downloads, a slightly lower correlation between Google Scholar citations and Mendeley readership, and the lowest correlation was between downloads and Mendeley readership.

AB Research e-visibility embodies online presence on the World Wide Web, discoverability via research e-profiles and accessibility of research output available online. The purpose of this study is to report on the e-visibility status phase of a longitudinal e-visibility study (Dec 2014-April 2017) investigating the e-visibility themes of online presence, researcher discoverability and accessibility of research output of the environmental science researchers at the University of South Africa. Bibliometric and altmetric data were collected via online searches and an online survey was completed by the School of Environmental Sciences during December 2014. The results for online research presence indicate a preference for using free search engines versus fee-based traditional resources. Regarding researcher discoverability via e-profiles, the results indicated a preference for using free websites, with the highest distribution on LinkedIn. A higher distribution of research output on free online resources was reported, with a low percentage of researchers participated in self-archiving on social networking tools, in online archives and in repositories, which resulted in a small percentage of accessible research output online. This research suggests that the development of an e-visibility strategy would support and enable academic e-visibility, therefore increasing online research visibility, discoverability and accessibility of the School of Environmental Sciences researchers at University of South Africa.

AB Libraries hold a long history of a multidimensional focus on collecting, storing, organizing, preserving and providing access to information resources for various types of users. Data is nothing new to Library and Information Science (LIS) and Big Data presents a quantitative expansion of an already well-known object of study. Scholarly communication, data sharing and data curation are three areas related to data in LIS and are discussed in this paper in the light of current developments as well as from the perspective of attaining the research area relevance in the discipline over time. Big Data, new technologies and networked research environments will continue to increase both in numbers and size. LIS is rapidly developing tools to meet the opportunities arising - through educational initiatives and the development of new research areas such as data curation and altmetrics. Since social and political demands for open data grow, these issues are pressing.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare four popular academic social networking sites (ASNSs), namely, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley and Zotero.
   Design/methodology/approach - Evaluation method has been used with the help of checklist covering various features of ASNSs. A structured checklist has been prepared to compare four popular ASNSs, comprising 198 dichotomous questions divided into 12 broad categories.
   Findings - The study found that performance of ASNSs using the latest features and services is not up to the mark, and none of the site is rated as "Excellent". The sites lack in incorporation of session filters; output features; privacy settings and text display; and search and browsing fields. Availability of bibilographic features and general features is poor in these sites. Further, altmetrics and analytics features are not incorporated properly. User interface of the sites need to improve to draw researchers to use them. The study report reveals that ResearchGate scored the highest, 61.1 per cent points, and was ranked "above average", followed by Academia. edu with 48.0 per cent and Mendeley with 43.9 per cent are ranked "average". However, the Zotero (38.9 per cent) was ranked "below average".
   Practical implications - Accreditation agencies can identify suitable sites in the evaluation of institutions' research output. Further, students and faculty members can choose the site suiting their needs. Library and information science professionals can use the checklist to impart training to the academic community which can help fostering research and development activities.
   Originality/value - The study identifies features that ought to be available in a model ASNS. These features are categorized into 12 broad categories. The findings can also be used by developers of the sites to enhance functionalities. Institutions can choose suitable sites while collaborating with other institutions.

AB Purpose - The introduction of "altmetrics" as new tools to analyze scientific impact within the reward system of science has challenged the hegemony of citations as the predominant source for measuring scientific impact. Mendeley readership has been identified as one of the most important altmetric sources, with several features that are similar to citations. The purpose of this paper is to perform an in-depth analysis of the differences and similarities between the distributions of Mendeley readership and citations across fields.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyze two issues by using in each case a common analytical framework for both metrics: the shape of the distributions of readership and citations, and the field normalization problem generated by differences in citation and readership practices across fields. In the first issue the authors use the characteristic scores and scales method, and in the second the measurement framework introduced in Crespo et al. (2013).
   Findings - There are three main results. First, the citations and Mendeley readership distributions exhibit a strikingly similar degree of skewness in all fields. Second, the results on "exchange rates (ERs)" for Mendeley readership empirically supports the possibility of comparing readership counts across fields, as well as the field normalization of readership distributions using ERs as normalization factors. Third, field normalization using field mean readerships as normalization factors leads to comparably good results.
   Originality/value - These findings open up challenging new questions, particularly regarding the possibility of obtaining conflicting results from field normalized citation and Mendeley readership indicators; this suggests the need for better determining the role of the two metrics in capturing scientific recognition.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between dissemination of research papers on Twitter and its influence on research impact.
   Design/methodology/approach - Four types of journal Twitter accounts (journal, owner, publisher and no Twitter account) were defined to observe differences in the number of tweets and citations. In total, 4,176 articles from 350 journals were extracted from Plum Analytics. This altmetric provider tracks the number of tweets and citations for each paper. Student's t-test for two-paired samples was used to detect significant differences between each group of journals. Regression analysis was performed to detect which variables may influence the getting of tweets and citations.
   Findings - The results show that journals with their own Twitter account obtain more tweets (46 percent) and citations (34 percent) than journals without a Twitter account. Followers is the variable that attracts more tweets (beta = 0.47) and citations (beta = 0.28) but the effect is small and the fit is not good for tweets (R-2 = 0.46) and insignificant for citations (R-2 = 0.18).
   Originality/value - This is the first study that tests the performance of research journals on Twitter according to their handles, observing how the dissemination of content in this microblogging network influences the citation of their papers.

AB Purpose - This study aims to analyse the geographical distribution of global research activities and to investigate the knowledge diffusion embodied in scientific papers.
   Design/methodology/approach -The geographical summary of Frontiers articles displays the number of visits and categorizes where the visitors hail from. This study uses the records of 23,798 articles published in 16 Frontiers journals from 2007 to 2015 to analyse the geographical distribution of article visits at both country and city levels. The process of knowledge diffusion is investigated on the basis of the different visiting patterns of new and old papers.
   Findings - Most article visits are concentrated around major metropolitan areas and some high-tech clusters. The top "visiting countries" include both developed countries and developing countries, and the USA and China are two major players. Publishing cities dominate article visits for new papers; as time passes, there is diffusion from the publishing cities to a broader area.
   Research limitations/implications - The data on visiting for open access articles may be generated from various repositories besides the publishers' websites; these data are ignored, as they are not significant enough to have much influence. There is also a lack of a basic theory in the data processing of outliers in the data set. In addition, only static results are given in this paper, as the data were collected on one day, for one time. A longer time period is necessary to track the dynamic diffusion process of the observations.
   Practical implications - Introduction of usage data will propose a novel way to analyse research activities and track knowledge diffusion. Social implications - The visiting data of articles offer a new way to investigate research activities at the city level in a detailed and timely manner, for the geographical distribution of research activities and the research resource allocation of a specific country to be explored.
   Originality/value - This study measured the research activities of scientific papers by examining the usage data. Compared with previous studies that focused on the geographical distribution of scientific activities using publication data, citation data and even altmetrics data, usage data are at the forefront of this research. Therefore, usage data offer a fresh perspective on methodology, providing more detailed and real-time information.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the distribution of profiles from academic social networking sites according to disciplines, academic statuses and gender, and detect possible biases with regard to the real staff distribution. In this way, it intends to know whether these academic places tend to become specialized sites or, on the contrary, there is a homogenization process.
   Design/methodology/approach - To this purpose, the evolution of profiles of one organization (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas) in three major academic social sites (Academia. edu, Google Scholar Citations and ResearchGate) through six quarterly samples since April 2014 to September 2015 are tracked.
   Findings - Longitudinal results show important disciplinary biases but with strong increase of new profiles form different areas. They also suggest that these virtual spaces are gaining more stability and they tend toward a equilibrate environment.
   Originality/value - This is the first longitudinal study of profiles from three major academic social networking sites and it allows to shed light on the future of these platforms' populations.

ID IMPACT
AB Purpose - Whereas traditional book and journal publishing remain the gold standard for many post-secondary institutions, nontraditional publishing is just as prolific at the flagship university in Maine. The university has strong land and sea grant missions that drive a broad research agenda, with an emphasis on community outreach and engagement. However, the impact of researchers' contributions outside of academe is unlikely to be accurately reflected in promotion, tenure or review processes. Thus, the authors designed a series of altmetrics workshops aimed at seeding conversations around novel ways to track the impact of researchers' diverse scholarly and creative outputs.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a case study of the instructional approach taken at the University of Maine library to facilitate discussions of alternative impact assessments that reach beyond traditional publications.
   Findings - Evaluations revealed an increased awareness of, and interest in, impact tracking tools that capture both traditional scholarship, like journal articles, and nontraditional scholarly and creative outputs, such as videos, podcasts and newsletters. The authors learned that altmetrics provides an entry point into a broader conversation about scholarly impact, and was best received by those whose scholarly output is not always captured by traditional metrics.
   Practical implications - Scholars are equipped with novel methods for describing the value of their work and discovering a broader audience for their research. Future initiatives will target the needs identified through initial conversations around altmetrics.
   Originality/value - Altmetrics workshops provide spaces to explore the potential for new tools that capture a range of previously unconsidered measures of impact, and to discuss the implications of those measures.

   Plum analytics; PlumX metrics
AB Purpose - The Saint Mary's College of California (SMC) library plays an integral role in supporting one of the goals in the College's Strategic Plan: "Raise the Academic Profile and Distinction". This case study aims to assess the effectiveness of PlumX as a tool to showcase the academic profile and distinction of SMC. The library recognizes the importance of capturing impact of non-traditional creativity and engagement in addition to just traditional impact metrics of research.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes the collaborative effort of the College and the College's library to identify faculty scholarship, creativity and engagement and collect data demonstrating the impact of the works. Traditional metrics, like citation counts, do not do SMC faculty justice because faculty scholarship comes beyond just books and articles. To more fully document the real intellectual corpus the College, the library is working with a new system, PlumX, to collect web-based information about both traditionally and non-traditionally published work.
   Findings - The collection of metrics across five categories (citations, usage, social media, mentions and captures), and the flexibility of displaying on screen or downloading for use in other analytic reports made possible through PlumX proved to be a start toward demonstrating the academic distinction of College's unique faculty. SMC will continue to partner with PlumX to assess and improve its usability and effectiveness.
   Originality/value - This paper outlines how altmetrics can be used to measure and share impact of faculty research at a liberal arts, teaching-focused college in ways reflective of the unique intellectual contributions.

ID IMPACT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report on a three-year case study of the extent with which altmetrics compare to traditional metrics in certain subject areas for selected departments at the University of Cincinnati, College of Medicine (COM).
   Design/methodology/approach - A three-year analysis of peer-reviewed papers and invited editorials from 2009 to 2013 written by tenure-track faculty from 20 COM departments was done to explore what subject areas received the highest altmetric scores. Research output was searched in PubMed; articles were quantified by subject area, times cited in Scopus, and its altmetric score over each of three successive years.
   Findings - The topics of the highest scored altmetric papers (n = 40) sample focused on stroke, obesity, and diabetes for all three years. Analysis of high initial altmetric scores over the course of the three years shifted from a possible predictor of future impact in the second year to no indicator of long-term interest in the scientific community as the public interest waned over time.
   Research limitations/implications - TheauthorsusedScopusTimesCitedandAltmetrics.comtogatherdata.
   Originality/value - Initially assessed a total of 3,678 unique publications and worked with the 40 highest altmetric scores in subsequent years. Data showed that subjects of interest to the public receive the highest altmetric scores and the topic areas did not change over the course of the study. These initially high altmetric scores do not indicate long-term interest by the scientific community.

AB Altmetrics or alternative metrics is a new kind of metrics originated at 2010 aiming at complimenting the traditional metrics. Altmetrics can provide a better view on the influvance of research or the reach of research on people. The major objective of the study was to identify the correlation between altmetrics score and citation. For this altmetrics data and citations for the articles on "Ebola" disease published in PLOS ONE journal during the years 2010-2015 were collected. The correlation between the altmetrics scores like saves, views, Mendeley and twitter are compared with bibliometric score citation. The result shows that all the altmetric scores except twitter have good correlation with traditional bibliometric citation.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of scientific data in order to assess the reliability of data to support data curation, to establish trust between researchers to support reuse of digital data and encourage researchers to share more data.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors compared the correlations between usage counts of associated data in Dryad and citation counts of articles in Web of Science in different subject areas in order to assess the possibility of using altmetric indicators to evaluate scientific data.
   Findings - There are high positive correlations between usage counts of data and citation counts of associated articles. The citation counts of article's shared data are higher than the average citation counts in most of the subject areas examined by the authors.
   Practical implications - The paper suggests that usage counts of data could be potentially used to evaluate scholarly impact of scientific data, especially for those subject areas without special data repositories.
   Originality/value - The study examines the possibility to use usage counts to evaluate the impact of scientific data in a generic repository Dryad by different subject categories.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of scholarly discussions of academic publications on the social web and to further discuss the validity of altmetrics as a research impact assessment tool for academic articles.
   Design/methodology/approach - Facebook posts citing psychological journal papers were collected for both quantitative and qualitative analyses. A content analysis approach was adopted to investigate topic preferences and motivations for scholarly discussions among academic and non-academic Facebook users.
   Findings - Non-academic users were more actively engaged in scholarly discussions on Facebook than academic users. Among 1,711 Facebook users in the sample, 71.4 percent of them belonged to non-academic users, while 28.6 percent were from an academic background. The Facebook users cited psychological articles with various motivations: discussion and evaluation toward articles (20.4 percent), application to real life practices (16.5 percent), self-promotion (6.4 percent), and data source exchange (6.0 percent). However, nearly half of the posts (50.1 percent) were simply sharing articles without additional user comments. These results implicate that Facebook metric (a count of mentions of a research article on Facebook), as an important source of altmetrics, better reflects the attitudes or perceptions of the general public instead of academia.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by enriching the understanding of Facebook metric as an academic and non-academic impact assessment tool for scientific publication. Through the content analysis of Facebook posts, it also draws insights into the ways in which non-academic audiences are engaging with scholarly outputs.

AB Purpose - Mendeley reader counts have been proposed as early indicators for the impact of academic publications. The purpose of this paper is to assess whether there are enough Mendeley readers for research evaluation purposes during the month when an article is first published.
   Design/methodology/approach - Average Mendeley reader counts were compared to the average Scopus citation counts for 104,520 articles from ten disciplines during the second half of 2016.
   Findings - Articles attracted, on average, between 0.1 and 0.8 Mendeley readers per article in the month in which they first appeared in Scopus. This is about ten times more than the average Scopus citation count.
   Research limitations/implications - Other disciplines may use Mendeley more or less than the ten investigated here. The results are dependent on Scopus's indexing practices, and Mendeley reader counts can be manipulated and have national and seniority biases.
   Practical implications - Mendeley reader counts during the month of publication are more powerful than Scopus citations for comparing the average impacts of groups of documents but are not high enough to differentiate between the impacts of typical individual articles.
   Originality/value - This is the first multi-disciplinary and systematic analysis of Mendeley reader counts from the publication month of an article.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the research performance of Pakistani library and information science (LIS) scholars, using the altmetrics provided by ResearchGate (RG).
   Design/methodology/approach - Purposive sampling was used to collect profiles between 15 January 2015 and 30 April 2016 of all members of RG who had self-identified as being an LIS scholar of Pakistani nationality. Additional demographic data were obtained through a small survey administered via Google Docs. Resultant data were analysed in SPSS Version 21.
   Findings - Study results were broadly consistent in terms of demographical data with previous studies of this cohort. There was a positive correlation between publications, reads, and citations for scholars who had recorded at least one publication. The majority of publications had not been published in a high impact factor journal. Academic networking site profiles create the potential for collaboration, building connections, and exchanging information.
   Research limitations/implications - Some scholars eliminated from this study may have published at least one output but neglected to upload details to RG. It is a purposive, exploratory study that provides insights into future research.
   Practical implications - The paper produces findings of relevance to researchers in other countries and/or disciplines who may wish to conduct a similar study of a defined cohort.
   Originality/value - There have been no previous published research studies on altmetrics associated with Pakistani LIS scholars.

AB The altmetrics emerges in 2010, proposing a set of new indicators that measure the impact of academic output from media and social networks data. This research examines some aspects of the impact made possible by altmetrics from Facebook and Twitter data analysis. We selected 100 papers, from the collection of the Scientific Electronic Library Online - SciELO, with higher scores (Altmetric Score), from altmetric. com tool. The profiles on Twitter and Facebook, referring to the 100 papers were analyzed, as well as the actions and reactions. The profiles were categorized as Academic Impact - IA or Social Impact - IS. They were identified and analyzed 947 Twitter and 682 Facebook accounts 682 (total of 1,629 accounts). The areas of Health Sciences, Life Sciences and Social Sciences, respectively, were the most provide altmetrics impacts. It was observed that the IS Impact is higher than IS and that Facebook has a greater number of users categorized in the IS profile than Twitter.

AB Purpose - In 2013, the National Information Standards Organization launched a three-year project to identify areas of potential community consensus around these new metrics and then develop recommended practices in those areas. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - After collecting community input on potential activities, NISO surveyed the community to prioritize five areas of work around which to develop community consensus.
   Findings - The NISO Working Groups produced a set of recommended practices that included: definitions and use cases for alternative metrics, applications of metrics for non-traditional scholarly outputs, collections of persistent identifiers around which metrics can be built, and a Code of Conduct for metrics providers.
   Originality/value - The development of standards and recommended practices around altmetrics will encourage adoption of these new metrics forms and will add to the trust in those metrics for the academy.

ID HUMANITIES
AB Purpose - Alternative metrics (altmetrics) are non-traditional metrics to measure the social impact of research results, which were unable to be assessed by the previous methods, by calculating how research results are reflected in various social media. The purpose of this paper is to measure and compare the impact of Korean study results in four fields that were published in international journals using altmetrics.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study analysed the impact of 383 Korean research articles published by international journals in the field of medical science, engineering, social science and arts and humanities through altmetrics and compared it with bibliometrics.
   Findings - As a result, the frequency of research articles which are "discussed"through social media such as Twitter was shown to be highest in the medical science than in other fields. In addition, the frequency of research articles which were "saved"through reference management tool such as Mendeley was shown to be higher in the social science and the arts and humanities than in other fields. Furthermore, as a result of a correlation analysis between altmetrics and bibliometrics, it is found that there exists a positive correlation between the number of articles which were "saved" in Mendeley and "cited" in follow-up studies.
   Originality/value - This study examined the impact of the articles originating in non-English-speaking nations; it could be referred by other non-English-speaking nations that are trying to identify invisible impact of their research output on global society. By finding the academic field which are receiving special attention from global community using altmetrics, researchers could prospect country's overall research impact and utilize it to make a future R&D plan.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to carry out an altmetric analysis of faculty members and research scholars of Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi (India) (Univ.Delhi P&A) who are members of the academic social networking site ResearchGate. ReserachGate is a rich source of altmetric indictors such as publications, reads, profile views, citations, impact points, RGScore, followers and following, etc. The RGScore, unique to ResearchGate, was further explored in depth in the study.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected manually by visiting the profile pages of all the members who had an account in ResearchGate under Univ. Delhi P&A during the first week of July, 2016. The authors found a total of 173 members in ResearchGate from the department. Data were collected for publications, reads, profile views, citations, impact points, RGScore, followers and following from the profile pages of the members. Correlations were calculated amongst the metrics provided by ResearchGate to seek the nature of the relationship amongst the various ResearchGate metrics.
   Findings - The analysis revealed that the publications added by researchers to their profiles were relatively low, as 28.32 per cent of the members had not added even a single publication to their profiles. Average reads acquired per person was found to be 909.49 and the median value of reads was found to be 95. Average citation per member in ResearchGate was found to be 414.60 and the median value was found to be 7. Majority of the researchers (45.09 per cent) had impact points in the range of 0.2-50. Most of the members (35.84 per cent) had followers in the range of 1-10. Majority of the members (52.02 per cent) had profile views in the range of 1-100. Most of the members (26.01 per cent) had RGScore equivalent to 0.01. The highest correlation of RGScore was found with publications added by researchers to their profiles, followed by correlation between RGScore and reads, correlation between RGscore and profile views, correlation between RGScore and number of Full Texts and correlation between RGScore and number of followers of a researcher.
   Originality/value - Not much research has been conducted in the area of altmetrics, especially using ResearchGate as a source of altmetrics. The findings of the study help in understanding the validity of ResearchGate as a source of altmetrics for research evaluation in a developing country such as India. Also, the novel ResearchGate indicator RGScore has been evaluated in great depth and its relationship with other ResearchGate altmetric and bibliometric indicators has been established.

AB Purpose - Altmetric indicators have been proposed as a complement to citation counts in research evaluation. Conceivably, they might also be used to supplement other methods for estimating journal readership. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of Mendeley reference management software to characterize the features of the readership of library and information science (LIS) literature.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used the Social Sciences Citation Index to retrieve 54,655 articles and reviews published between 1995 and 2014 and indexed in the category "Information Science & Library Science". Each record was then searched in Mendeley to obtain the number of bookmarks of the paper and the academic status of the users.
   Findings - Mendeley covers 61 per cent of the LIS literature published in the last 20 years. In all, 75 per cent of the papers published in the last five years had been bookmarked at least once in Mendeley whereas just 55 per cent had been cited in Web of Science. Reviews are bookmarked more frequently than articles, and papers in English have more bookmarks than papers in any other language. Most users of LIS literature are PhD and postgraduate students.
   Originality/value - The study shows that altmetrics can be used as a source of data in information behaviour studies. Reference management software provides an unobtrusive means of capturing reading habits in the scholarly literature. Compared to citation counts, bookmarks are rapidly available and also reflect usage outside the academic community.

ID CITATIONS; IMPACT; TWITTER; METRICS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of altmetrics in different disciplines of social science: first, by investigating the current richness and future potential of altmetrics in the selected social science disciplines and then by evaluating the validity of altmetrics as indicators of research impact in each discipline through correlation analysis.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses three approaches to understand the current richness and future potential of ten altmetric measures in nine selected disciplines: first, investigate the distribution and trend of altmetric data; second, verify the relationship between citation rate and altmetric presence of the discipline using Pearson correlation; and third, perform word frequency analysis on tweets to understand different altmetric presence in different disciplines. In addition, this study uses Spearman and sign test to find the correlation between altmetrics and citation counts for the articles that receive altmetric mention(s) to test the validity of altmetrics as indicators of research impact.
   Findings - There is a steady increase in the number of articles that receive altmetric mentions in all disciplines studied. In general, disciplines with higher citation rates have higher altmetric presence. At the same time, altmetrics are also an effective complement to citation in disciplines with low citation rates. There is a moderate correlation with Mendeley and significant but weak correlations with Tweets and CiteULike in seven disciplines. Altmetrics appear effective as a predictor of citation counts in seven out of nine disciplines studied. However, there is low presence and lack of correlation with citation count in business-finance and law disciplines.
   Originality/value - This paper furthers the understanding of altmetrics in social science disciplines. It reveals the disciplines where altmetrics are most effective, potentially useful, and fairly applicable. In addition, it presents evidence that altmetrics are an effective complement to citation in disciplines with low citation rates.

AB A new class of social web-based metrics for scholarly publications (altmetrics) has surfaced as a complement to traditional citation-based metrics. Our aim was to study and characterize those recent papers in the field of Parkinson's disease which had received the highest Altmetric Attention Scores and to compare this attention measure to the traditional metrics. The top 20 papers in our analysis covered a variety of topics, mainly new disease mechanisms, treatment options and risk factors for the development of PD. The main media sources for these high attention papers were news items and Twitter. The papers were published predominantly in high impact journals, suggesting a correlation between altmetrics and conventional metrics. One paper published in a relatively modest journal received a significant amount of attention, reflecting that public attention does not always parallel the traditional metrics. None of the most influential papers in PD, as reviewed by Ponce and Lozano (2011) made it to our list, suggesting that recent publications receive higher attention scores, and that altmetrics may omit older, seminal work in the field.

AB The Institutional Repositories have significant potential as sources of information for the preparation of metrics studies aimed at understanding the dynamics of institutional scientific activity. However, Institutional Repositories have deficiencies with regard to visual externalization of their vast scientific content in the form of bibliometric and altmetric indicators. In this context, the aim of this paper was to investigate the capability of national initiatives in Open Access Institutional Repositories in the use of bibliometric and altmetric indicators based on information visualization concepts. The research method used was the exploratory case study and the analysis unit comprises 81 Institutional Repositories, active in Brazilian Science and Technology Institutions, identified in the Directory of Open Access Repositories - OpenDOAR. The results achieved understood the identification and analysis of the presence in the Brazilian Institutional Repositories of bibliometric and altmetric indicators and its graphical visualization. It was observed that the bibliometric indicators showed a higher rate of occurrence in the analyzed sample than altmetric indicators and paucity of Institutional Repositories in providing the indicators using a visual representation. It is concluded that the discussion of the results can contribute to the understanding of the issues surrounding the use of Institutional Repositories, as sources of information for the preparation and visualization of bibliometric and altmetric indicators on the dynamics of scientific activities performed by Brazilian Science and Technology Institutions.

AB It presents an altmetric analysis of the term "Institutional Repository" on Twitter in the period from 2009 to 2015. The study is qualitative and quantitative, descriptive in nature, and used altmetrics to show posts related to the term and the content analysis thereof in order to identify the relationships established between the term and associated issues. The results showed that the first publications about the Institutional Repository term in Portuguese on Twitter appeared in 2009, and the highest number of tweets on the subject took place in 2013. It highlighted the prevalence of the category "social citations" and "Institutional Repository Disclosure", which most often mentions the implementation of Repositories. In posts related to social citation there is mention of "Books" and "Journal article", a reference to the repository of UFBA, which provided the largest number of books published by the Publishing House of the Institution. The most frequent hashtag was #opendoar, which is the official directory of academic open access repositories, developed by the University of Nottingham, in the UK. Finally, altmetric studies are considered a possibility of analysis of the relationship between social media and the scientific production and an alternative to disseminate and/or share such information among researchers and stakeholders.

TI Towards designing the Indicator for Scholarly Academic Research Impact
   based on h-index
SO QUALITATIVE & QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN LIBRARIES
LA English
DT Article
DE h-index; Scholarly Academic Research Impact (SARI); Tappered h-index;
   g-index; self-citation
AB Present paper discusses Scholarly Academic Research Impact (SARI). According to J. E. Hirsch, the main criteria for devising an indicator are number of citations, scientific age of author, subject of the papers, self-citations, simplicity, universal applicability, least sensitive to small change of bibliographic record etc. The h-index has included some of these criteria. However some criteria still need to be incorporated during calculating h-index. Here I have tried to consider some relevant components to h-index for better reflection of SARI. I think h-index will be in core but some other measurements should be incorporated for better reflection of the impact. The total number of citations or average number of citations per article should be included to for calculating the SARI. G-index includes some articles having very high citations but does not include citations beyond hirsch's core. But hT-index has the provision to give weightages of all the citations of all the articles even beyond Hirsch's core but it is very complicated to understand and to calculate. The scientist having higher scientific age naturally will get more citations than the younger, so we need to incorporate this criterion when calculating SARI. Therefore technique should be developed to conform the relation "SARI will be inversely proportional to Scientific Age of the researcher or scientist". The SARI should have universal applicability (for author, journal, publisher, country etc.). Again variations among the disciplines and subjects need to be kept in mind when designing SARI, so that the issue should be normalized. The language biasness is very hard to avoid during designing SARI. There are so many indicators like JIF, h-index and its variants, altmetrics etc, but my proposal is to develop a single indicator which should include all the aspects of all the indicators as far as possible. In the present context of electronic web environment we have to measure societal impact along with the scholarly academic impact. In this regard, altmetrics. is basically the tool for weighing societal impact of the scholarly articles by counting number of downloaded, viewed, re-used, shared, liked etc. We cannot ignore these criteria in the social networking environment. But altmetrics is not so crystallized as it depends on web visibility and validation. Therefore present study intentionally has excluded altmetrics aspect of SARI. I have not given any concrete formula rather just have wanted to draw a theory for designing a SARI indicator based on h-index.

AB This paper presents a bibliographic analysis of Nature articles based on altmetrics. We assess the concern degree of social users on the Nature articles through the coverage analysis of Twitter and Facebook by publication year and discipline. The social media impact of a Nature article is examined by evaluating the mention rates on Twitter and on Facebook. Moreover, the correlation between tweets and citations is analyzed by publication year, discipline and Twitter user type to explore factors affecting the correlation. The results show that Twitter users have a higher concern degree on Nature articles than Facebook users, and Nature articles have higher and faster-growing impact on Twitter than on Facebook. The results also show that tweets and citations are somewhat related, and they mostly measure different types of impact. In addition, the correlation between tweets and citations highly depends on publication year, discipline and Twitter user type.

AB This study aimed to assess the mediating role of save, discussion, and recommendation measures in the relationship between visibility and citation in biomedical articles in 2009-2013. Path analysis method was used to assess the causal relationships between the variables in this descriptive correlational study. Systematic and random stratified methods were employed for sampling. The sample size was determined to be 1892 articles using the Cochrane formula and data were gathered by using the PLOS altmetrics. The study's model fit indices showed that visibility influences citation both directly and indirectly through the mediating role of save. Discussion had a significant, negative role in the relationship between visibility and citation, and recommendation did not have any significant mediating role in this relationship. Among the social networks presenting altmetrics, it seems that networks such as Mendeley which provide a basis for saving scientific articles have an important and significant effect on the amount of future citations through visibility metrics. This is while social networks discussing scientific findings have a negative effect on the future citation of articles through visibility metrics. This asserts that social networks based on save have an influential role as the basis of scientific interaction.

AB An experiment run in 2009 could not assess whether making monographs available in open access enhanced scholarly impact. This paper revisits the experiment, drawing on additional citation data and tweets. It attempts to answer the following research question: does open access have a positive influence on the number of citations and tweets a monograph receives, taking into account the influence of scholarly field and language? The correlation between monograph citations and tweets is also investigated. The number of citations and tweets measured in 2014 reveal a slight open access advantage, but the influence of language or subject should also be taken into account. However, Twitter usage and citation behaviour hardly overlap.

AB This study compares Spanish and UK research in eight subject fields using a range of bibliometric and social media indicators. For each field, lists of Spanish and UK journal articles published in the year 2012 and their citation counts were extracted from Scopus. The software Webometric Analyst was then used to extract a range of altmetrics for these articles, including patent citations, online presentation mentions, online course syllabus mentions, Wikipedia mentions and Mendeley reader counts and Altmetric.com was used to extract Twitter mentions. Results show that Mendeley is the altmetric source with the highest coverage, with 80 % of sampled articles having one or more Mendeley readers, followed by Twitter (34 %). The coverage of the remaining sources was lower than 3 %. All of the indicators checked either have too little data or increase the overall difference between Spain and the UK and so none can be suggested as alternatives to reduce the bias against Spain in traditional citation indexes.

AB Scientists and managers using citation-based indicators to help evaluate research cannot evaluate recent articles because of the time needed for citations to accrue. Reading occurs before citing, however, and so it makes sense to count readers rather than citations for recent publications. To assess this, Mendeley readers and citations were obtained for articles from 2004 to late 2014 in five broad categories (agriculture, business, decision science, pharmacy, and the social sciences) and 50 subcategories. In these areas, citation counts tended to increase with every extra year since publication, and readership counts tended to increase faster initially but then stabilize after about 5 years. The correlation between citations and readers was also higher for longer time periods, stabilizing after about 5 years. Although there were substantial differences between broad fields and smaller differences between subfields, the results confirm the value of Mendeley reader counts as early scientific impact indicators.

AB Visualization of scientific results using networks has become popular in scientometric research. We provide base maps for Mendeley reader count data using the publication year 2012 from the Web of Science data. Example networks are shown and explained. The reader can use our base maps to visualize other results with the VOSViewer. The proposed overlay maps are able to show the impact of publications in terms of readership data. The advantage of using our base maps is that it is not necessary for the user to produce a network based on all data (e.g., from 1 year), but can collect the Mendeley data for a single institution (or journals, topics) and can match them with our already produced information. Generation of such large-scale networks is still a demanding task despite the available computer power and digital data availability. Therefore, it is very useful to have base maps and create the network with the overlay technique.

ID BENEFITS
AB In the current UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) and the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), societal impact measurements are inherent parts of the national evaluation systems. In this study, we deal with a relatively new form of societal impact measurements. Recently, Altmetric-a start-up providing publication level metrics-started to make data for publications available which have been mentioned in policy documents. We regard this data source as an interesting possibility to specifically measure the (societal) impact of research. Using a comprehensive dataset with publications on climate change as an example, we study the usefulness of the new data source for impact measurement. Only 1.2 % (n = 2341) out of 191,276 publications on climate change in the dataset have at least one policy mention. We further reveal that papers published in Nature and Science as well as from the areas "Earth and related environmental sciences" and "Social and economic geography" are especially relevant in the policy context. Given the low coverage of the climate change literature in policy documents, this study can be only a first attempt to study this new source of altmetrics data. Further empirical studies are necessary, because mentions in policy documents are of special interest in the use of altmetrics data for measuring target-oriented the broader impact of research.

AB The relationship between traditional metrics of research impact (e.g., number of citations) and alternative metrics (altmetrics) such as Twitter activity are of great interest, but remain imprecisely quantified. We used generalized linear mixed modeling to estimate the relative effects of Twitter activity, journal impact factor, and time since publication on Web of Science citation rates of 1,599 primary research articles from 20 ecology journals published from 2012-2014. We found a strong positive relationship between Twitter activity (i.e., the number of unique tweets about an article) and number of citations. Twitter activity was a more important predictor of citation rates than 5-year journal impact factor. Moreover, Twitter activity was not driven by journal impact factor; the 'highest-impact' journals were not necessarily the most discussed online. The effect of Twitter activity was only about a fifth as strong as time since publication; accounting for this confounding factor was critical for estimating the true effects of Twitter use. Articles in impactful journals can become heavily cited, but articles in journals with lower impact factors can generate considerable Twitter activity and also become heavily cited. Authors may benefit from establishing a strong social media presence, but should not expect research to become highly cited solely through social media promotion. Our research demonstrates that altmetrics and traditional metrics can be closely related, but not identical. We suggest that both altmetrics and traditional citation rates can be useful metrics of research impact.

AB In this article, I argue that scientific fame and impact exists on a continuum from the mundane to the transformative/revolutionary. Ideally, one achieves fame and impact in science by synthesizing two extreme career prototypes: intrinsic and extrinsic research. The former is guided by interest, curiosity, passion, gut, and intuition for important untapped topics. The latter is guided by money, grants, and/or what is being published in top-tier journals. Assessment of fame and impact in science ultimately rests on productivity (publication) and some variation of its impact (citations). In addition to those traditional measures of impact, there are some relatively new metrics (e.g., the h index and altmetrics). If psychology is to achieve consensual cumulative progress and better rates of replication, I propose that upcoming psychologists would do well to understand that success is not equal to fame and that individual career success is not necessarily the same as disciplinary success. Finally, if one is to have a successful and perhaps even famous career in psychological science, a good strategy would be to synthesize intrinsic and extrinsic motives for one's research.

AB Speed and breadth have been suggested as two advantages of altmetrics over citation counts since they might estimate impact immediately after publication and beyond the academic community of authors. In order to investigate the validity of these claims, we performed a fifteen-month longitudinal study of the evolution of bookmarks in Mendeley for a set of 3813 articles published in Library and Information Science in 2014. Results show that 87.6% of the literature was bookmarked at least once by May 2016 whereas only 55% was cited. The correlation between bookmarks and citations was moderate and the overlap between the most frequently bookmarked and the most frequently cited papers increased over time. A significant share of the bookmarks were made by students and professionals, although the shares of bookmarks made by different categories of users changed as time went by. Bookmarks made by users based in less wealthy nations also increased over time. The study is limited by the incomplete information provided by Mendeley regarding users' academic status and country of residence, the upgrades of the software used in data collection, and the fact that one year is a rather long publication period for a longitudinal study of a fast changing feature like bookmarks.

AB This paper shows how bibliometric assessment can be implemented at individual level. This has been successfully done at the University of Vienna carried out by the Department for Bibliometrics and Publication Strategies of the Vienna University Library. According to the department's philosophy, bibliometrics is not only a helpful evaluation instrument in order to complement the peer review system. It is also meant as a compass for researchers in the 'publish or perish' dilemma in order to increase general visibility and to optimize publication strategies. The individual assessment comprises of an interview with the researcher under evaluation, the elaboration of a bibliometric report of the researcher's publication output, the discussion and validation of the obtained results with the researcher under evaluation as well as further optional analyses. The produced bibliometric reports are provided to the researchers themselves and inform them about the quantitative aspects of their research output. They also serve as a basis for further discussion concerning their publication strategies. These reports are eventually intended for informed peer review practices, and are therefore forwarded to the quality assurance and the Rector's office and finally sent to the peers. The most important feature of the generated bibliometric report is its multidimensional and individual character. It relies on a variety of basic indicators and further control parameters in order to foster comprehensibility. Researchers, administrative staff and peers alike have confirmed the usefulness of this bibliometric approach. An increasing demand is noticeable. In total, 33 bibliometric reports have been delivered so far. Moreover, similar reports have also been produced for the bibliometric assessment of two faculties with great success.

AB Usage data of scholarly articles provide a direct way to explore the usage preferences of users. Using the "Usage Count" provided by the Web of Science platform, we collect and analyze the usage data of five journals in the field of Information Science and Library Science, to investigate the usage patterns of scholarly articles on Web of Science. Our analysis finds that the distribution of usage fits a power law. And according to the time distribution of usage, researchers prefer to use more recent papers. As to those old papers, citations play an important role in determining the usage count. Highly cited old papers are more likely to be used even a long time after publication.

AB An important way in which medical research can translate into improved health outcomes is by motivating or influencing clinical trials that eventually lead to changes in clinical practice. Citations from clinical trials records to academic research may therefore serve as an early warning of the likely future influence of the cited articles. This paper partially assesses this hypothesis by testing whether prior articles referenced in ClinicalTrials.gov records are more highly cited than average for the publishing journal. The results from four high profile general medical journals support the hypothesis, although there may not be a cause-and effect relationship. Nevertheless, it is reasonable for researchers to use citations to their work from clinical trials records as evidence of the possible long-term impact of their research.

ID IMPACT; BIAS
AB The objective of this paper is to understand the relationship between the diffusion and mention of research papers in Twitter according to whether their authors are members or not of that micro-blogging service. To that end, 4166 articles from 76 Twitter users and 124 from non-Twitter users were analysed. Data on Twitter mentions were extracted from PlumX Analytics, information on each Twitter user was taken from the own platform and citations were collected from Scopus public API. Results show that papers from Twitter users are 33 % more tweeted than documents of non-Twitter users. From Twitter users, the increase of followers produces 30 % more tweets. No differences were found between the citation impact (i.e. number of citations) of papers authored by Twitter users and non-Twitter users. However, the number of followers indirectly influences the citation impact. The main conclusion is that the participation on Twitter affects the dissemination of research papers, and in consequence, it indirectly favours the likelihood that academic outputs being cited.

AB Altmetrics is an emergent research area whereby social media is applied as a source of metrics to assess scholarly impact. In the last few years, the interest in altmetrics has grown, giving rise to many questions regarding their potential benefits and challenges. This paper aims to address some of these questions. First, we provide an overview of the altmetrics landscape, comparing tool features, social media data sources, and social media events provided by altmetric aggregators. Second, we conduct a systematic review of the altmetrics literature. A total of 172 articles were analysed, revealing a steady rise in altmetrics research since 2011. Third, we analyse the results of over 80 studies from the altmetrics literature on two major research topics: cross-metric validation and coverage of altmetrics. An aggregated percentage coverage across studies on 11 data sources shows that Mendeley has the highest coverage of about 59 % across 15 studies. A meta-analysis across more than 40 cross-metric validation studies shows overall a weak correlation (ranging from 0.08 to 0.5) between altmetrics and citation counts, confirming that altmetrics do indeed measure a different kind of research impact, thus acting as a complement rather than a substitute to traditional metrics. Finally, we highlight open challenges and issues facing altmetrics and discuss future research areas.

AB Scholarly articles are discussed and shared on social media, which generates altmetrics. On the opposite side, what is the impact of social media on the dissemination of scholarly articles and how to measure it? What are the visiting patterns? Investigating these issues, the purpose of this study is to seek a solution to fill the research gap, specifically, to explore the dynamic visiting patterns directed by social media, and examine the effects of social buzz on the article visits. Using the unique real referral data of 110 scholarly articles, which are daily updated in a 90-day period, this paper proposes a novel method to make analysis. We find that visits from social media are fast to accumulate but decay rapidly. Twitter and Facebook are the two most important social referrals that directing people to scholarly articles, the two are about the same and account for over 95 % of the total social referral directed visits. There is synchronism between tweets and tweets resulted visits. Social media and open access are playing important roles in disseminating scholarly articles and promoting public understanding science, which are confirmed quantitatively for the first time with real data in this study.

Thus, the perceived importance is not assessed, leaving it to the readers to decide whether an article is of interest and importance to them. After the highly successful launch of the PLOS ONE megajournal, other publishers followed this path. The current paper undertakes a review of the articles published internationally on the megajournal criteria defining its concept. It also traces how the new type of scientific publication has been developing and expanding since the PLoS ONE launch in 2006.

AB Introduction: Novel bibliometric indexes (commonly known as altmetrics) are gaining interest within the scientific community and might represent an important alternative measure of research quality and output.
   Aims: We evaluate how these new metrics correlate with established bibliometric indexes such as the impact factor (IF), currently used as a measure of scientific production as well as a criterion for scientific research funding, and how they might be helpful in assessing the impact of research.
   Methods: We calculated altmetrics scores for all the articles published at our institution during a single year and examined the correlation between altmetrics scores and IFs as a measure of research quality and impact in all departments.
   Results: For all articles from the various departments published in a single year, the altmetrics score and the sum of all IFs showed a strong and significant correlation (Spearman's rho 0.88). The correlation was significant also when the major components of altmetrics, including Facebook, Twitter and Mendeley, were analyzed. The implementation of altmetrics has been found to be easy and effective at both the researcher and librarian levels.
   Conclusions: The novel bibliographic index altmetrics is consistent and reliable and can complement or be considered a valid alternative to standard bibliometric indexes to benchmark output and quality of research for academic and funding purposes.

AB Purpose: Create an index of global reach for healthcare hashtags and tweeters therein, filterable by topic of interest.
   Materials and methods: For this proof-of-concept study we focused on the field of Primary Care and Family Medicine. Six hashtags were selected based on their importance, from the ones included in the 'Healthcare Hashtag Project'. Hashtag Global Reach (HGR) was calculated using the additive aggregation of five weighted, normalized indicator variables: number of impressions, tweets, tweeters, user locations, and user languages. Data were obtained for the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 using Symplur Signals. Topic-specific HGR were calculated for the top 10 terms and for sets of quotes mapped after a thematic analysis. Individual Global Reach, IGR, was calculated across hashtags as additive indexes of three indicators: replies, retweets and mentions.
   Results: Using the HGR score we were able to rank six selected hashtags and observe their performance throughout the study period. We found that #PrimaryCare and #FMRevolution had the highest HGR score in both quarters; interestingly, #FMChangeMakers experienced a marked increase in its global visibility during the study period. "Health Policy" was the commonest theme, while "Care", "Family" and "Health" were the most common terms.
   Discussion: This is the first study describing an altmetric hashtag index. Assuming analytical soundness, the Index might prove generalizable to other healthcare hashtags. If released as a real-time business intelligence tool with customizable settings, it could aid publishing and strategic decisions by netizens, organizations, and analysts. IGR could also serve to augment academic evaluation and professional development.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using an index on the global reach of healthcare hashtags and tweeters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Theoretical review of the methods to measure scientific production impact in the area of Metric Studies of Information, focusing on Altmetrics, a more recent approach. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the rise of altmetrics with the emergence of Web 2.0 and social media, examining the impact and influence of academic activities in these new online platforms. This study addresses altmetrics' origin, concepts, applications, indicators, data sources, tools, and ways to retrieve information from social media platforms, as well as previous or traditional research metrics. It discusses reasons to use alternative indicators and metrics to measure academic research impact and presents the future perspectives that these metrics are opening. It was concluded that Altmetrics can be considered as alternative complementary metrics to traditional metrics because they can give a fair reflection of citations count or global scholarly impact, resulting in a more democratic science.

AB Sleeping beauties (SB) is a term that is used to describe scientific articles that pass unnoticed in science for long periods of time until they are rediscovered. This phenomenon is little known in the scientific community and contradicts some of science's basic presuppositions. At the same time, the current reality of scientific research is defined according to the quantity of information that is produced. Although the SB field of study is little known, it has very specific characteristics that generate a number of cross-cutting interpretations about the way that science reflects on itself. This article explores three problems that the SB spotlights which are conceptualized within the same epistemological approach. We concludes that the SB analysis and the expected increase in the occurrence of SBs offers a point upon which to reflect bout epistemological frameworks of scientific practice.

AB A mathematical structure for defining multi-valued bibliometric indices is provided with the aim of measuring the impact of general sources of information others than articles and journals-for example, repositories of datasets. The aim of the model is to use several scalar indices at the same time for giving a measure of the impact of a given source of information, that is, we construct vector valued indices. We use the properties of these vector valued indices in order to give a global answer to the problem of finding the optimal scalar index for measuring a particular aspect of the impact of an information source, depending on the criterion we want to fix for the evaluation of this impact. The main restrictions of our model are (1) it uses finite sets of scalar impact indices (altmetrics), and (2) these indices are assumed to be additive. The optimization procedure for finding the best tool for a fixed criterion is also presented. In particular, we show how to create an impact measure completely adapted to the policy of a specific research institution.

DE Altmetrics; Citation; Correlation Coefficient
AB The paper intends to verify the relationship between altmetrics and citation analysis using thematic orientation as a trace identifier for the works analysed, as well as Pearson's correlation coefficient. Therefore 441 articles from the journal DataGramaZero were categorized by a taxonomy featuring ten Information Science research themes. The category "Theoretical and general aspects of information science" was highlighted with more articles cited and a greater attention online. It was perceived that the two variables tend to behave similarly in relation to the time of publication, however, a low correlation between the number of mention and the number of citations for each article was noted. When the coefficients of the two variables weighted averages were calculated for thematic orientations, the correlation became moderate (P = 0,65). The results were similar to previous findings in the literature, reinforcing the potential of the Pearson's correlation coefficient for metric studies in information science.

AB The purpose of this study was to discover whether there are scholarly evaluation metrics that can be applied to a wide range of books' types and contents. We analyzed over 70,000 books and collected various metrics per each title including traditional and altmetrics measures. The analysis in this paper depicts the top books showing the highest rates of citations, reviews, readership, downloads, twitter and more. Our results show that books display different impact in each of the measurements and vary by types and content. There isn't one measure that captures the impact of books across the board. We conclude that books should be evaluated by types and contents while using different measures per each.

AB In social tagging systems, like Mendeley, CiteULike, and BibSonomy, users can post, tag, visit, or export scholarly publications. In this paper, we compare citations with metrics derived from users' activities (altmetrics) in the popular social bookmarking system BibSonomy. Our analysis, using a corpus of more than 250,000 publications published before 2010, reveals that overall, citations and altmetrics in BibSonomy are mildly correlated. Furthermore, grouping publications by user-generated tags results in topic-homogeneous subsets that exhibit higher correlations with citations than the full corpus. We find that posts, exports, and visits of publications are correlated with citations and even bear predictive power over future impact. Machine learning classifiers predict whether the number of citations that a publication receives in a year exceeds the median number of citations in that year, based on the usage counts of the preceding year. In that setup, a Random Forest predictor outperforms the baseline on average by seven percentage points. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Medical research is highly funded and often expensive and so is particularly important to evaluate effectively. Nevertheless, citation counts may accrue too slowly for use in some formal and informal evaluations. It is therefore important to investigate whether alternative metrics could be used as substitutes. This article assesses whether one such altmetric, Mendeley readership counts, correlates strongly with citation counts across all medical fields, whether the relationship is stronger if student readers are excluded, and whether they are distributed similarly to citation counts. Based on a sample of 332,975 articles from 2009 in 45 medical fields in Scopus, citation counts correlated strongly (about 0.7; 78% of articles had at least one reader) with Mendeley readership counts (from the new version 1 applications programming interface [API]) in almost all fields, with one minor exception, and the correlations tended to decrease slightly when student readers were excluded. Readership followed either a lognormal or a hooked power law distribution, whereas citations always followed a hooked power law, showing that the two may have underlying differences.

AB De Marchi and Lorenzetti (Scientometrics 106(1):253-261, 2016) have recently argued that in fields where the journal impact factor (IF) is not calculated, such as in the humanities, it is key to find other indicators that would allow the relevant community to assess the quality of scholarly journals and the research outputs that are published in them. The authors' suggestion is that information concerning the journal's rejection rate and the number of subscriptions sold is important and should be used for such assessment. The question addressed by the authors is very important, yet their proposed solutions are problematic. Here I point to some of these problems and illustrate them by considering as a case in point the field of philosophy. Specifically, here I argue for four main claims. First, even assuming that IF provides a reliable indicator of the quality of journals for the assessment of research outputs, De Marchi and Lorenzetti have failed to validate their suggested indicators and proxies. Second, it has not been clarified why, in absence of IF, other journal-based metrics that are currently available should not be used. Third, the relationship between IF and rejection rate is more complex than the authors suggest. Fourth, accepting the number of sold subscriptions as a proxy would result in discrimination against open access journals. The upshot of my analysis is that the question of how to assess journals and research outputs in the humanities is still far from resolved.

AB For the normalization of citation counts, two different kinds of methods are possible and used in bibliometrics: the cited-side and citing-side normalizations both of which can also be applied in the normalization of "Mendeley reader counts". Haunschild and Bornmann (2016a) introduced the paper-side normalization of reader counts (mean normalized reader score, MNRS) which is an adaptation of the cited-side normalization. Since the calculation of the MNRS needs further data besides data from Mendeley (a field-classification scheme, such as the Web of Science subject categories), we introduce here the reader-side normalization of reader counts which is an adaptation of the citing-side normalization and does not need further data from other sources, because self-assigned Mendeley disciplines are used. In this study, all articles and reviews of the Web of Science core collection with publication year 2012 (and a DOI) are used to normalize their Mendeley reader counts. The newly proposed indicator (mean discipline normalized reader score, MDNRS) is obtained, compared with the MNRS and bare reader counts, and studied theoretically and empirically. We find that: (i) normalization of Mendeley reader counts is necessary, (ii) the MDNRS is able to normalize Mendeley reader counts in several disciplines, and (iii) the MNRS is able to normalize Mendeley reader counts in all disciplines. This generally favorable result for the MNRS in all disciplines leads to the recommendation to prefer the MNRS over the MDNRS provided that the user has an external field-classification scheme at hand.

AB Altmetrics or other indicators for the impact of academic outputs are often correlated with citation counts in order to help assess their value. Nevertheless, there are no guidelines about how to assess the strengths of the correlations found. This is a problem because the correlation strength affects the conclusions that should be drawn. In response, this article uses experimental simulations to assess the correlation strengths to be expected under various different conditions. The results show that the correlation strength reflects not only the underlying degree of association but also the average magnitude of the numbers involved. Overall, the results suggest that due to the number of assumptions that must be made, in practice it will rarely be possible to make a realistic interpretation of the strength of a correlation coefficient.

AB With increasing uptake among researchers, social media are finding their way into scholarly communication and, under the umbrella term altmetrics, are starting to be utilized in research evaluation. Fueled by technological possibilities and an increasing demand to demonstrate impact beyond the scientific community, altmetrics have received great attention as potential democratizers of the scientific reward system and indicators of societal impact. This paper focuses on the current challenges for altmetrics. Heterogeneity, data quality and particular dependencies are identified as the three major issues and discussed in detail with an emphasis on past developments in bibliometrics. The heterogeneity of altmetrics reflects the diversity of the acts and online events, most of which take place on social media platforms. This heterogeneity has made it difficult to establish a common definition or conceptual framework. Data quality issues become apparent in the lack of accuracy, consistency and replicability of various altmetrics, which is largely affected by the dynamic nature of social media events. Furthermore altmetrics are shaped by technical possibilities and are particularly dependent on the availability of APIs and DOIs, strongly dependent on data providers and aggregators, and potentially influenced by the technical affordances of underlying platforms.

ID SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION; TRUST; AUTHORITY; BEHAVIOR
AB This paper reports a survey on citation behaviour of Malaysian researchers. It is part of a wider study gauging quality and trustworthiness in scholarly communication in the emerging digital environment. The survey questionnaire was distributed between 1 October 2014 and 31 January 2015. A total of 391 respondents, from four research areas (humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences) completed the questionnaire. The finding indicated that motivations for citing were complex and multi-faceted, but in all four disciplines, researchers cite a work because they regard it as an authoritative and trustworthy source, which provides a context or building block to their own research. Although researchers have moved from a print-based system to a digital one, it has not significantly changed the way they decide what to trust. Peer reviewed journals are still the most influential. Open access journals will be cited if they have been peer reviewed. Citing on the basis of high altmetrics and other social judgements, such as mentions, likes, and use, was not prevalent. Measures of establishing trust and authority do not seem to have changed profoundly in Malaysia.

AB The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about the reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells by Garnett and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (Garnett et al., 2012). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 4C, 4E, 4F, and Supplemental Figures 16 and 20. Garnett and colleagues performed a high throughput screen assessing the effect of 130 drugs on 639 cancer-derived cell lines in order to identify novel interactions for possible therapeutic approaches. They then tested this approach by exploring in more detail a novel interaction they identified in which Ewings sarcoma cell lines showed an increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Figure 4C). Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) transformed with the signature EWS-FLI1 translocation, the hallmark of Ewings sarcoma family tumors, exhibited increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib as compared to MPCs transformed with a different translocation (Figure 4E). Knockdown mediated by siRNA of EWS-FLI1 abrogated this sensitivity to olaparib (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.

AB Since 2002, Project COUNTER has led the way in developing and maintaining systems of measurement for download counts. While these counts have often been used as a proxy measure in determining journal and article value for libraries and publishers, they miss an important post-download secondary usage factor - namely, that of sharing. Likewise, altmetrics, while accounting for the impact of social media, misses some aspects of sharing as distribution often occurs via email. This creates difficulty in quantifying an exact measure of use. One aim of the Beyond Downloads project was to develop a calculator for measuring total digital usage - including sharing. Through an examination of a range of sharing systems, we identified the most commonly used platforms for sharing scholarly articles, while an international survey provided data on access, download, saving, and sharing behavior. Survey results indicated that a range of sharing patterns can be estimated, but post-download usage often is too skewed to establish exact calculations. Therefore, in lieu of a sharing calculator, we derived ranges of sharing patterns at a confidence level of 95%. These ranges vary dependent on many factors. Furthermore, our project highlighted the primary issues in developing a secondary usage calculator -namely, the lack of global standards in sharing data and the necessity to extend a survey data approach into a longitudinal study. As a consequence, we recommend a two-fold approach going forwards: 1) data-based approach in which a COUNTER-like universal standard for sharing data is developed and adopted across multiple platforms; 2) survey-based approach in which a longitudinal study is administered to a multi-disciplinary online community.

ID IMPACT FACTOR; CITATIONS; QUALITY; METRICS; TWEETS
AB Introduction Altmetrics is a new and emerging scholarly tool that measures online attention surrounding journal articles. Altmetric data resources include: policy documents, news outlets, blogs, online reference managers (eg Mendeley and CiteULike), post-publication peer-review forums (eg PubPeer and Publons), social media (eg Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, Google(+), Pinterest, Reddit), Wikipedia, sites running Stack Exchange (Q&A), and reviews on F1000 and YouTube. Methods To identify the top 50 dental articles in 2014, PubMed was searched using the following query "("2014/1/1"[PDAT]:" 2014/12/31"[PDAT]) and jsubsetd[text]" in December, 2015. Consequently, all PubMed records were extracted and sent to Altmetric LLP (London, UK) as a CSV file for examination. Data were analysed by Microsoft Office Excel 2010 using descriptive statistics and charts. Results Using PubMed searches, 15,132 dental articles were found in 2014. The mean Altmetric score of 50 top dental articles in 2014 was 69.5 +/- 73.3 (95% CI: -74.14 to 213.14). The British Dental Journal (48%) and Journal of Dental Research (16%) had the maximum number of top articles. Twitter (67.13%), Mendeley (15.89%) and news outlets (10.92%) were the most popular altmetric data resources. Discussion Altmetrics are intended to supplement bibliometrics, not replace them. Altmetrics is a fresh and emerging arena for the dental research community. We believe that dental clinical practitioners, research scientists, research directors and journal editors must pay more attention to altmetrics as a new and rapid tool to measure the social impact of scholarly articles.

AB Objective. To study the publication productivity of Spanish emergency physicians in the 5-year period from 2010 through 2014 and compare it with the previous period (2005-2009).
   Methods. Articles authored by emergency physicians affiliated with institutions in Spain were selected from the Science Citation Index Expanded; conference presentations were excluded. We collected data for year of publication, author information, journal, the journal's impact factor (IF), type of article, cites received, and area of research. We searched at 2010-2014 period, and these data were compared with historic data from the 2005-2009 period.
   Results. A total of 1433 articles were published in 2010-2014; 52.4% were original research articles (56% more than in 2005-2009, P=.01). The mean journal IF associated with the publications was slightly higher in 2010-2014 (2.587 vs 2.483 for 2005-2009). The median was slightly lower (2.295 vs 3.085 in the earlier period), but the 90th percentile was higher (4.036 vs 3.085, P=0.01), reflecting an increase in the number of publications in journals with high IFs. Most articles continue to be published in Castilian Spanish (67.8%), although the percentage of articles published in English increased significantly, from 25.2% in the previous period to 32.1% in 2010-2014; P=.001). Scientific publications in emergency medicine come mainly from specialists working in hospital emergency departments (89%). Authors affiliated with a university are in the minority, although their percentage increased significantly from 10.9% in the previous period to 16.2% in the recent one (P=.001). Collaboration increased in the recent period in all categories: between hospitals in the same Spanish autonomous community (from 24.7% to 36%), in different communities (from 10.9% to 19%), or in different countries (from 2.3% to 8.4%) (P=.001, all comparisons). The most productive research areas were cardiovascular conditions (accounting for 13.1% of the publications), infectious diseases (13.0%), toxicology and pharmacology (9.2%), pediatric emergencies (8.0%), respiratory diseases (7.4%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (6.7%), and management (6.0%). Catalonia produced the largest number of papers (427 [29.8%]). Hospital Clinic de Barcelona ranked first among hospitals publishing research, with 145 articles (11.4% of the total in this category); the emergency services of Madrid (SUMMA-112) ranked first among out-of-hospital research groups, with 43 publications (36.7% of the total in this category). Catalonia, Madrid, Castile-La Mancha, the Canary Islands, Murcia, the Balearic Islands, and La Rioja increased their contributions to Spanish productivity by 20% or more over their output in the earlier 5-year period. Nine of the 2010-2014 articles have already attracted enough cites to be considered citation classics.
   Conclusions. The productivity of Spanish emergency physicians continued to grow at a good pace in the 2010-2014 period. Publications in journals with IFs increased and there were significant changes in the dynamics of publication and the subjects covered.

AB Since new publishing models and new communication channels are being developed, traditional ways of measuring journal and article impact are not sufficient besides bibliometrics, altmetrics arises as a new method based on quantitative analysis of mentions on blogs, in the news, shares on social networking sites etc. The main purpose of the study is to analyze the altmetric indicators for Altmetric top 100 articles in 2014, and to compare them with traditional bibliometric data for the same articles. Also, altmetric scores for Open Access (OA) articles are compared to the scores for non-OA articles. The research confirms low correlation between the number of citations (in the first year after publication) and the altmetric score. Nevertheless, the altmetric score has a potential role in promoting articles and getting post-publication evaluation and feedback.

ID CITATION INDICATORS; SOCIETAL IMPACT; TWEETS; UNIVERSALITY; ALTMETRICS;

AB One possible way of measuring the broad impact of research (societal impact) quantitatively is the use of alternative metrics (altmetrics). An important source of altmetrics is Twitter, which is a popular microblogging service. In bibliometrics, it is standard to normalize citations for cross-field comparisons. This study deals with the normalization of Twitter counts (TC). The problem with Twitter data is that many papers receive zero tweets or only one tweet. In order to restrict the impact analysis on only those journals producing a considerable Twitter impact, we defined the Twitter Index (TI) containing journals with at least 80 % of the papers with at least 1 tweet each. For all papers in each TI journal, we calculated normalized Twitter percentiles (TP) which range from 0 (no impact) to 100 (highest impact). Thus, the highest impact accounts for the paper with the most tweets compared to the other papers in the journal. TP are proposed to be used for cross-field comparisons. We studied the field-independency of TP in comparison with TC. The results point out that the TP can validly be used particularly in biomedical and health sciences, life and earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, as well as physical sciences and engineering. In a first application of TP, we calculated percentiles for countries. The results show that Denmark, Finland, and Norway are the countries with the most tweeted papers (measured by TP).

ID SCIENTIFIC IMPACT; ET-AL; CIRCULATION; ARTICLE; CITATIONS
AB Background-A prior randomized controlled trial of social media exposure at Circulation determined that social media did not increase 30-day page views. Whether insufficient social media intensity contributed to these results is uncertain.
   Methods and Results-Original article manuscripts were randomized to social media exposure compared with no social media exposure (control) at Circulation beginning in January 2015. Social media exposure consisted of Facebook and Twitter posts on the journal's accounts. To increase social media intensity, a larger base of followers was built using advertising and organic growth, and posts were presented in triplicate and boosted on Facebook and retweeted on Twitter. The primary outcome was 30-day page views. Stopping rules were established at the point that 50% of the manuscripts were randomized and had 30-day follow-up to compare groups on 30-day page views. The trial was stopped for futility on September 26, 2015. Overall, 74 manuscripts were randomized to receive social media exposure, and 78 manuscripts were randomized to the control arm. The intervention and control arms were similar based on article type (P=0.85), geographic location of the corresponding author (P=0.33), and whether the manuscript had an editorial (P=0.80). Median number of 30-day page views was 499.5 in the social media arm and 450.5 in the control arm; there was no evidence of a treatment effect (P=0.38). There were no statistically significant interactions of treatment by manuscript type (P=0.86), by corresponding author (P=0.35), by trimester of publication date (P=0.34), or by editorial status (P=0.79).
   Conclusions-A more intensive social media strategy did not result in increased 30-day page views of original research.

AB The main goal of this article is to describe the purpose and content of a new branch of bibliometrics: ALMetrics (Author-Level Metrics). ALMetrics is focused on the quantitative analysis of an author's performance by measuring the dimensions of their intellectual activity as shown through varied metric indicators. This article will list, define, and classify the different metrics that are offered in newer information portals that showcase the scientific activity of authors. These metrics are grouped into five sets: bibliometrics (publication and citation), usage, participation, rating, social connectivity, and composite indicators. This new bibliometric specialty is necessary because of new trends in scientific assessment, which have moved analysis away from old bibliometrics (based on journal analysis and Impact Factor) towards new bibliometrics that analyze both documents and authors via a mix of indicators. Most importantly, ALMetrics responds to the researchers' desire for both knowledge and acknowledgement.

ID TWEETS
AB In this study, we explore the citedness of research data, its distribution over time and its relation to the availability of a digital object identifier (DOI) in the Thomson Reuters database Data Citation Index (DCI). We investigate if cited research data "impacts'' the (social) web, reflected by altmetrics scores, and if there is any relationship between the number of citations and the sum of altmetrics scores from various social media platforms. Three tools are used to collect altmetrics scores, namely PlumX, ImpactStory, and Altmetric.com, and the corresponding results are compared. We found that out of the three altmetrics tools, PlumX has the best coverage. Our experiments revealed that research data remain mostly uncited (about 85 %), although there has been an increase in citing data sets published since 2008. The percentage of the number of cited research data with a DOI in DCI has decreased in the last years. Only nine repositories are responsible for research data with DOIs and two or more citations. The number of cited research data with altmetrics "foot-prints'' is even lower (4-9 %) but shows a higher coverage of research data from the last decade. In our study, we also found no correlation between the number of citations and the total number of altmetrics scores. Yet, certain data types (i.e. survey, aggregate data, and sequence data) are more often cited and also receive higher altmetrics scores. Additionally, we performed citation and altmetric analyses of all research data published between 2011 and 2013 in four different disciplines covered by the DCI. In general, these results correspond very well with the ones obtained for research data cited at least twice and also show low numbers in citations and in altmetrics. Finally, we observed that there are disciplinary differences in the availability and extent of altmetrics scores.

AB Although Mendeley bookmarking counts appear to correlate moderately with conventional citation metrics, it is not known whether academic publications are bookmarked in Mendeley in order to be read or not. Without this information, it is not possible to give a confident interpretation of altmetrics derived from Mendeley. In response, a survey of 860 Mendeley users shows that it is reasonable to use Mendeley bookmarking counts as an indication of readership because most (55%) users with a Mendeley library had read or intended to read at least half of their bookmarked publications. This was true across all broad areas of scholarship except for the arts and humanities (42%). About 85% of the respondents also declared that they bookmarked articles in Mendeley to cite them in their publications, but some also bookmark articles for use in professional (50%), teaching (25%), and educational activities (13%). Of course, it is likely that most readers do not record articles in Mendeley and so these data do not represent all readers. In conclusion, Mendeley bookmark counts seem to be indicators of readership leading to a combination of scholarly impact and wider professional impact.

AB This study aimed to gather the opinions of editors of Library and Information Science journals indexed in Scopus and the Web of Knowledge regarding the current situation and their forecasts on open access, peer review procedures, functionalities, and specialization. The response rate was 23%, and some noteworthy conclusions can be drawn according to editors' opinions: Within 5-10 years, the main business model for journal publishing will be open access. Institutional support is the preferred source of financing. The review process requires less than 2 months, and the main problems are low quality of texts and finding reviewers. Functionalities such as mobile versions of the journals, social media, data policy, and altmetrics have yet to be exploited; interdisciplinarity will increase the presence of these functionalities in journals, especially through the influence of the related areas of Communication, Management, and Computer Science. Finally, the area that will see the most changes is the management of research data.

AB Basic chemical engineering and processes control tools were utilized to describe the flow of news information in the Internet. Data on the news coverage of scientific articles provided by Altmetric were analyzed for six chemistry journals. The timecourse of the news was modeled using linear system dynamics, resulting in an interpretable description of the timescales involved. The model was additionally tested by applying it to the flow of nonscientific news information. An investigation on the distribution of news items per scientific article further identified online news generation as a preferential growth process. The model results allowed a discussion on scientific impact in public media and an analysis on how this impact can be influenced by authors and journals. In respect to the field of engineering, the work shows that traditional ChemE and process control tools developed for the abstraction of physical and chemical systems can also be utilized to describe social and information related processes.

AB This article introduces a new source of evidence of the value of medical-related research: citations from clinical guidelines. These give evidence that research findings have been used to inform the day-to-day practice of medical staff. To identify whether citations from guidelines can give different information from that of traditional citation counts, this article assesses the extent to which references in clinical guidelines tend to be highly cited in the academic literature and highly read in Mendeley. Using evidence from the United Kingdom, references associated with the UK's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines tended to be substantially more cited than comparable articles, unless they had been published in the most recent 3 years. Citation counts also seemed to be stronger indicators than Mendeley readership altmetrics. Hence, although presence in guidelines may be particularly useful to highlight the contributions of recently published articles, for older articles citation counts may already be sufficient to recognize their contributions to health in society.

   INDEX
AB Social media are becoming increasingly popular in scientific communication. A range of platforms, such as academic social networking sites (SNS), are geared specifically towards the academic community. Proponents of the altmetrics approach have pointed out that new media allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment. Traditional impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been criticized for overlooking the relational dynamics of scientific impact. We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to researchers' interactions on an academic social networking site to generate potential new metrics of scientific impact. Based on a case study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars, we analyze how centrality measures derived from the participants' interactions on the academic SNS ResearchGate relate to traditional, offline impact indicators. We find that platform engagement, seniority, and publication impact contribute to members' indegree and eigenvector centrality on the platform, but less so to closeness or betweenness centrality. We conclude that a relational approach based on social network analyses of academic SNS, while subject to platform-specific dynamics, may add richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment.

AB The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et alg 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from "COT drives resistance to RAF inhibition through MAPK pathway reactivation" by Johannessen and colleagues, published in Nature in 2010 (Johannessen et an, 2010). The key experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3B, 3D-E, 31, and 4E-F. In Figures 3B, DE, RPMI-7951 and OUMS023 cells were reported to exhibit robust ERK/MEK activity concomitant with reduced growth sensitivity in the presence of the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. MAP3K8 (COT/ TPL2) directly regulated MEK/ERK phosphorylation, as the treatment of RPMI-7951 cells with a MAP3K8 kinase inhibitor resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of MEK/ERK activity (Figure 31). In contrast, MAP3K8-deficient A375 cells remained sensitive to BRAF inhibition, exhibiting reduced growth and MEK/ERK activity during inhibitor treatment. To determine if RAF and MEK inhibitors together can overcome single-agent resistance, MAP3K8-expressing A375 cells treated with PLX4720 along with MEK inhibitors significantly inhibited both cell viability and ERK activation compared to treatment with PLX4720 alone, as reported in Figures 4E-F. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from "IDH mutation impairs histone demethylation and results in a block to cell differentiation" by Lu and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (Lu et al., 2012). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D and 4D. Lu and colleagues demonstrated that expression of mutant forms of IDH1 or IDH2 caused global increases in histone methylation and increased levels of 2 hydroxyglutarate (Figure 1B). This was correlated with a block in differentiation (Figures 2A, B and D). This effect appeared to be mediated by the histone demethylase KDM4C (Figure 4D). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Scienceand Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.

AB ResearchGate is currently one of the most important academic social networks, with more than 9 million users and 80 million documents. The platform offers not only important academic networking tools and job vacancies but also a wide range of bibliometric indicators. The objective of this work is to discuss the main advantages and disadvantages of these indicators paying special attention to the RG Score, the ResearchGate's flagship indicator. Although ResearchGate provides features and bibliometric indicators of enormous potential in order to gather additional insights about the scientific and academic impact of authors' production, their communication policies and some recent actions taken in the design, development, and dissemination of indicators generate serious doubts regarding their use for evaluation purposes. Finally, regarding the RG Score indicator, we conclude that it does not measure the prestige of researchers, but instead their level of participation in the platform.

AB ObjectivesAlternative-level metrics (Altmetrics) are a new method to assess the sharing and spread of scientific knowledge. The primary objective of this study was to describe the traditional metrics and Altmetric scores of the 50 most frequently cited articles published in emergency medicine (EM) journals. Since many articles related to EM are published in other journals, the secondary aim of this study was to describe the Altmetric scores of the most frequently cited articles relevant to EM in other biomedical journals.
   MethodsA structured search of the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science version of the Science Citation Index Expanded was conducted. The 200 most frequently cited articles in the top 10 EM journals (2011 Journal Citation Report) were identified. The 200 most frequently cited articles from the rest of the medical literature, matching a predefined list of keywords relevant to the specialty of EM, were identified. Two authors reviewed the lists of citations for relevance to EM and a consensus approach was used to arrive at the final lists of the top 50 cited articles. The Altmetric scores for the top 50 cited articles in EM and other journals were determined. Descriptive statistics and Spearman correlation were performed.
   ResultsThe highest Altmetric score for EM articles was 25.0; the mean (SD) was 1.9 (+/- 5.0). The EM journal with the highest mean article Altmetric score was Resuscitation. The main clinical areas shared for articles from EM articles were trauma (mean +/- SD = 11.0 +/- 15.6, median = 11.0) and cardiac arrest (mean +/- SD = 2.7 +/- 5.8, median = 0). The highest Altmetric score for other journals was 176.0 (mean +/- SD = 23.3 +/- 40.8). The other journal with the highest mean article Altmetric score was the New England Journal of Medicine. The main clinical areas shared for articles were critical care (mean +/- SD score = 36.5 +/- 47.4, median = 36.5), sepsis (mean +/- SD = 24.6 +/- 48.8, median = 12.0), cardiology (mean +/- SD = 19.2 +/- 35.6, median = 7.0), and infectious diseases (mean +/- SD = 17.0 +/- 12.7, median = 17.0). Spearman correlation demonstrated weakly positive correlation between citation counts and Altmetric scores for EM articles and other journals.
   ConclusionsThis study is the first analysis of Altmetric scores for the top cited articles in EM. We demonstrated that there is a mild correlation between citation counts and Altmetric scores for the top papers in EM and other biomedical journals. We also demonstrated that there is a gap between the sharing of the top articles in EM journals and those related to EM in other biomedical journals. Future research to explore this relationship and its temporal trends will benefit the understanding of the reach and dissemination of EM research within the scientific community and society in general.

AB The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high -profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et at, 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from "Coding -Independent Regulation of the Tumor Suppressor PTEN by Competing Endogenous 'mRNAs' by Tay and colleagues, published in Cell in 2011 (Tay et al., 2011). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3C, 3D, 3G, 3H, 5A and 5B, and in Supplemental Figures 3A and B. Tay and colleagues proposed a new regulatory mechanism based on competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), which regulate target genes by competitive binding of shared microRNAs. They test their model by identifying and confirming ceRNAs that target PTEN. In Figure 3A and B, they report that perturbing expression of putative PTEN ceRNAs affects expression of PTEN. This effect is dependent on functional microRNA machinery (Figure 3G and H), and affects the pathway downstream of PTEN itself (Figures 5A and B). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errinton et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from "The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate" by Ward and colleagues, published in Cancer Cell in 2010 (Ward et al., 2010). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2, 3 and 5. Ward and colleagues demonstrate the mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abrogate the enzyme's wild-type activity and confer to the mutant neomorphic activity that produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) (Figures 2 and 3). They then show that elevated levels of 2-HG are correlated with mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 in AML patient samples (Figure 5). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published by eLife.

AB The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a substantial number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of experiments from "A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations" by Sharma and colleagues, published in Cell in 2010 (Sharma et al., 2010). Sharma and colleagues demonstrated that prolonged exposure of cancer cells to TKIs give rise to small populations of "drug tolerant persisters" (DTPs) (Figure 1 B-C) that were reversed during subsequent maintenance under drug-free conditions (Figures 1E, 2B and 2E). DTPs exhibited reduced histone acetylation and sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) (Figure 4A-B). Drug sensitivity was restored with co-treatment of either HDIs or an IGF-1R inhibitor, in combination with TKIs (Figure 5A-B). Inhibition of IGF-1R activation also led to decreased KDM5A expression and restoration of H3K4 methylation, suggesting a direct link between the IGF-1R signaling pathway and KDM5A function (Figure 7A, 7C, and 71). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from "Diverse somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in human cancers" by Kan and colleagues published in Nature in 2010 (Kan et al., 2010). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 3D-F and 4C-F. Kan and colleagues utilized mismatch repair detection (MRD) technology to identify somatic mutations in primary human tumor samples and identified a previously uncharacterized arginine 243 to histidine (R243H) mutation in the Gprotein a subunit GNAO1 in breast carcinoma tissue. In Figures 3D-F, Kan and colleagues demonstrated that stable expression of mutant GNAO1(R243D) conferred a significant growth advantage in human mammary epithelial cells, confirming the oncogenic potential of this mutation. Similarly, expression of variants with somatic mutations in MAP2K4, a JNK pathway kinase (shown in Figures 4C-E) resulted in a significant increase in anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, these mutants exhibited reduced kinase activity compared to wild type MAP2K4, indicating these mutations impose a dominant-negative influence to promote growth (Figure 4F). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et at, 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from 'Fusobacterium nucleatum infection is prevalent in human colorectal carcinoma' by Castellarin and colleagues published in Genome Research in 2012 (Castellarin et al., 2012). The experiment to be replicated is reported in Figure 2. Here, Castellarin and colleagues performed a metagenomic analysis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to identify potential associations between inflammatory microorganisms and gastrointestinal cancers. They conducted quantitative real-time PCR on genomic DNA isolated from tumor and matched normal biopsies from a patient cohort and found that the overall abundance of Fusobacterium was 415 times greater in CRC versus adjacent normal tissue. These results confirmed earlier studies and provide evidence for a link between tissue-associated bacteria and tumorigenesis.

AB This study aims to shed light on the implementation of the digital object identifier (DOI) in the two most important multidisciplinary databases, namely Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus, within the last decade (2005-2014). The results show a generally increased percentage of items with DOI in all the disciplines in both databases, which provide very similar numbers and trends. While the percentage of citable items with a DOI has already reached 90% in the Sciences and the Social Sciences in 2014, it has remained much lower in the Arts & Humanities, exceeding 50% only since 2013. The observed values for Books and Proceedings are even lower despite the importance of these document types, particularly for the Social Sciences and the Arts & Humanities. The fact that there are still journals with a large number of items still lacking DOIs in 2014 should be alarming for the corresponding editors and should give them reason to enhance the formal quality and visibility of their journals. Finally, scientists are also encouraged to review their publication strategies and to favour publication channels with established DOI assignments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As research performance becomes increasingly important for academic institutions in competition for rankings, student recruitment, and funding, many performance indicators have been developed to measure various aspects of research performance. ResearchGate combines bibliometrics and altmetrics to create a more comprehensive performance measure for researchers and institutions. The ResearchGate score, the flagship indicator calculated by an undisclosed algorithm, is a metric that measure scientific reputation. In this research, ResearchGate metrics are firstly compared with those that Research Excellence Framework (REF) and Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings to assess the quality of UK universities and global universities respectively. This study then utilizes correlation analysis to examine whether ResearchGate metrics demonstrate effectiveness on the researcher level in comparison with SciVal metrics. For this research, 300 ResearchGate members from the supply chain management field were selected. The results provide empirical evidence that demonstrate that the ResearchGate score can be an effective indicator for measuring individual researcher performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ALTMETRICS; INDICATORS
AB A different number of citations can be expected for publications appearing in different subject categories and publication years. For this reason, the citation-based normalized indicator Mean Normalized Citation Score (MNCS) is used in bibliometrics. Mendeley is one of the most important sources of altmetrics data. Mendeley reader counts reflect the impact of publications in terms of readership. Since a significant influence of publication year and discipline has also been observed in the case of Mendeley reader counts, reader impact should not be estimated without normalization. In this study, all articles and reviews of the Web of Science core collection with a publication year of 2012 (and a DOI) are used to normalize their Mendeley reader counts. A new indicator that determines the normalized reader impact is obtained-the Mean Normalized Reader Score (MNRS) - and compared with the MNCS. The MNRS enables us to compare the impact a paper has had on Mendeley across subject categories and publication years. Comparisons on the journal and university level show that the MNRS and MNCS correlate larger for 9601 journals than for 76 German universities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from "Melanoma exosomes educate bone marrow progenitor cells toward a pro-metastatic phenotype through MET" by Peinado and colleagues, published in Nature Medicine in 2012 (Peinado et al., 2012). The key experiments being replicated are from Figures 4E, as well as Supplementary Figures 1C and 5A. In these experiments, Peinado and colleagues show tumor exosomes enhance metastasis to bones and lungs, which is diminished by reducing Met expression in exosomes (Peinado et al., 2012). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

A few years ago the influence of an investigation was measured through the impact of the publication in which it was framed and citations received by it, it is currently envisaged that this form of evaluation is not sufficiently complete if it does not have into account the influence that social media research. This is been called Altmetrics or alternative metrics, it does not come to exclude, if not complement the measurement of classical Biliometrics. This article describes a study of what Altmetrics is, its features, tools, and how the professional information may contribute to the re vitalization, identity and visibility of your organization through transversal training and the integration of research teams in your institutions.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the publication rate of Canadian health sciences librarians, post-conference presentation. Discover barriers that prevent librarians from taking conference presentation to full publication. Assess the metrics available to librarians for scholarly output measurement by examining metrics, traditional and altmetrics, of articles resulting from conference presentation.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey using FluidSurveys was distributed via e-mail to authors of poster and papers presentation presented at Canadian Health Libraries Association/Association des bibliothSques de la sante du Canada conferences from 2004 to 2009. A literature search for articles matching presentations in National Library of Medicine's PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts was conducted to determine publication rate. Metrics of retrieved articles were gathered and analyzed to gage scholarly output of Canadian health sciences librarians.
   Findings - A publication rate of 31.5 percent was determined by literature search. Time restriction was the most common reported reason for not publishing. The altmetric analysis included 71 articles, of which 52 percent had at least one value in various metrics, with Mendeley counts being the most common value represented.
   Research limitations/implications - Not all survey respondents may be library science professionals, so that survey findings may not be generalizable to the Canadian health librarian profession. While every effort was made to find and confirm publications related to conference presentations, the reported publication rate may be either an over estimate or under estimate of the true rate. Current altmetric science is very dynamic and evolving.
   Originality/value - This study provides a baseline publication rate, identifies barriers librarians face to publication and provides a glimpse into the state of metrics available to Canadian librarians for evaluation of their scholarly output.

ID HUMANITIES RESEARCH; SOCIAL-SCIENCES; IMPACT
AB Purpose - Social media has given way for the development of various new altmetric indicators. Mendeley readership count is one such indicator. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the paper aims to investigate the relationship between citation counts and Mendeley readership counts. The paper also evaluates the relationship between Mendeley readership metrics for two different time periods, thereby investigating its nature as an altmetric indicator.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using the Scopus database. Top 100 papers in Physics published during 2005 as well as in 2010 that received the largest number of citations were selected. Mendeley readership data were collected using Mendeley readership statistics for documents indexed in Scopus. For establishing a relationship between citation counts and Mendeley readership, correlation was calculated between the citations in Scopus database and Mendeley readership. The difference in Mendeley readership for different time periods was also investigated.
   Findings - The paper showed that for both the years, Mendeley readership counts were in positive correlation with citation counts. For the year 2010, it was found that Mendeley readership counts were in strong positive correlation with citation counts, whereas for 2005, they were in moderate positive correlation.
   Research limitations/implications - One of the limitations of this paper is that with time more scientists and researchers may join Mendeley causing various changes in data and giving different results. Also, the paper has focused on the highly cited papers in Physics.
   Originality/value - Very few studies have been conducted in the area of altmetrics, as it is a comparatively new and emerging field of research. The findings of this paper offer insights to the question whether Mendeley readership counts can be used as an alternative to traditional sources of bibliometric indicators like citations, h-index, etc. The paper also evaluates the difference in the nature of traditional bibliometric indicators and Mendeley readership counts.

This document is the culmination of a two-phase project initialized in 2013, supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and designed to support the uptake of altmetrics, additional forms of assessment of scholarly outputs beyond conventional citation analysis. To further facilitate adoption of these new assessment measures, the scholarly community developed consensus work via NISO that addresses several areas of the altmetric environment: definitions and use cases; persistent identifiers, output types, and data metrics; and data quality.

DT Article
ID GOOGLE-SCHOLAR; OF-SCIENCE; COVERAGE; IMPACT; UNIVERSITIES; EVOLUTION
AB Objective - This paper explores how to utilize two well-known library databases, Thomson Reuter's Web of Science and Elsevier's Scopus, to quantify Long Island educational institutions' scholarly productivity.
   Methods - Institutions located in the Long Island region and within Nassau and Suffolk counties, including the State University of New York (SUNY) colleges, private institutions, and technical schools, were examined for the last 14 years (2000-2013). Eight Long Island institutions were represented in both databases and were included in the study.
   Results - Of the eight institutions, Stony Brook University produced the most publications indexed in Web of Science and Scopus during the period of 2000-2013. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory yielded the second most publications during 2000-2013 in both Web of Science and Scopus, but it produced the highest quality publications compared with other institutions excluding Stony Brook University. Although the annual growth rates of Farmingdale State College and New York Institute of Technology increased dramatically in both Web of Science and Scopus, the large proportional increase did not represent a large increase in total value. Additionally, some institutions had a higher number of publications indexed in Web of Science than in Scopus, and others had a higher number of publications indexed in Scopus than in Web of Science.
   Conclusions - Data were collected from institutions in Long Island with various institutional sizes, the number of faculty members employed may have made an impact on the number of publications. Thus, publication data in this study cannot be used to compare their rankings. Institutions with a similar type and similar size of faculty members should be selected for comparison. Due to the different coverage and scope of Web of Science and Scopus, institutions should use both databases to examine their scholarly output. Furthermore, institutions should consider using altmetrics to capture various impacts of the scholarly output to complement the traditional metrics.

AB Objective - To measure the knowledge and opinions that academic librarians have of established and emerging research metrics.
   Methods - An online survey was distributed to all academic librarians in Oklahoma during Summer 2015.
   Results - Librarians were less familiar with altmetrics than with bibliometrics, but they viewed altmetrics as effective and were interested in receiving training to learn more about them. Librarians who had been in the profession for over five years knew more about both bibliometrics and altmetrics than newer librarians.
   Conclusions - Technological advances and changes in the ways that research products are shared have led to the possibility of and need for new ways of measuring research impact. Altmetrics have emerged to fill this need, but academic librarians need more familiarity and training to be able to fulfill a role as providers of these metrics.

   Research and Teaching in all Academic Disciplines
SO EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective - To determine faculty's information behaviour and their perception of academic libraries in the current transition between print and electronic scholarly communication.
   Design - Online survey.
   Setting - A consortium of 12 large universities in Spain.
   Subjects - More than 17,380 faculty members.
   Methods - The researchers used a questionnaire based on a subset of the questionnaire used for the Ithaka S+R Faculty Survey, with 20 closed and 2 open-ended questions. The survey was implemented via Google Forms and sent through mailing lists. The number of recipients was not known, but university statistics for 11 of the 12 universities list 17,380 faculty (statistics were not available for one university, located in a different administrative area). The questions aimed to identify the types of documents used by scholars for teaching and research, the search tools used, the strategies used to keep up-to-date in their disciplines, preferences for print or electronic books, the sources used to access documents, their preferred channels to disseminate their own research, and their views regarding library services.
   Main Results - The response rate was 12.7%. Based on the results, scholarly journals were the most used information resource for research across all academic disciplines, with 94% of respondents rating them as important. For teaching, faculty preferred to use textbooks for undergraduates, and journal articles for Master's students. To search the literature, faculty chose bibliographic databases and Internet search engines over the library catalog and physical collections, although the catalog was the first choice for known-item searches. Respondents favored print to read entire books or chapters but preferred the electronic format for skimming. Of the respondents, 78% rated the library as an important channel to access resources, while 61% also considered free online materials important. If the material was not available at their library, 71% frequently chose to search for a free online version and 42% used the inter-library loan service. For their own research, faculty have published in scholarly journals more often than other channels and have selected the journal based on its impact factor (77.5% ranked it as important) and on its area of coverage (73.4%). When asked to rank library services, faculty placed paying for resources highest, with 86.2% identifying it as important. Next were facilitating teaching and helping students develop information literacy skills. Finally, a majority of faculty considered themselves highly dependent on the library.
   Conclusion - Journal articles are the most widely used information resource for research and teaching purposes, regardless of discipline. This includes arts and humanities, which are known for heavy monograph usage. Articles are also scholars' preferred channel for publishing. With regards to books, faculty have mixed feelings about print and electronic formats. Spanish faculty display information behaviours similar to their British and American counterparts, as documented in the Ithaka S+R 2012 surveys. Blogs and social networks are not widely used in spite of growing attention to such channels for research output and altmetrics. Open access is also relatively unimportant for faculty when they choose where to publish. A majority of respondents still consider library services as important, for collections as well as teaching and learning support, which may present opportunities for librarians.

AB Introduction and objective: The emergence of the Internet and social media is having a powerful influence on the ways in which researchers discover, access, process and communicate information. The methods used by systems measuring the impact of a scientific paper used during the last forty years, and questioned, are demonstrating more clearly insufficient in this new context, they do not provide information of all interactions that occur in the new social media. Altmetrics emerges as a complementary resource and does not exclude traditional metrics to provide a richer view of the influence of an investigation. Method: Narrative review. This article presents an analysis of the implications of altmetrics, advantages, disadvantages, and achievements made. Results: It is considered that altmetrics provides a broader view of the social implications of research beyond the purely academic. Discussion: While it is not easy to disentangle what is the meaning of altmetrics and what kind of impact accurately measures. Conclusions: altmetrics although it is not yet considered by the agencies of scientific accreditation, is already being used by some of the most important publishers, as it provides an immediate picture of the impact of an investigation, and ultimately may be a mechanism to predict the future academic impact of research, there are still many aspects to consider as all related to standardization of sources and methods of compilation of the results, but we can say that has altmetrics come and will have to be taken into account in the immediate future by lso accreditation bodies and research funding.

ID ALTMETRICS
AB In this study, we investigated the impact of scientific publications of the Italian SIMPAR (Study In Multidisciplinary PAin Research) group by using altmetrics, defined as nontraditional metrics constituting an alternative to more traditional citation-impact metrics, such as impact factor and H-index. By correlating traditional and alternative metrics, we attempted to verify whether publications by the SIMPAR group collectively had more impact than those performed by its individual members, either in solo publications or in publications coauthored by non-SIMPAR group investigators (which for the purpose of this study we will refer to as "individual publications"). For all the 12 members of the group analyzed (pain therapists, biologists, and pharmacologists), we created Open Researcher and Contributor ID and Impact Story accounts, and synchronized these data. Manually, we calculated the level metrics for each article by dividing the data obtained from the research community by those obtained from the public community. We analyzed 759 articles, 18 of which were published by the SIMPAR group. Altmetrics demonstrated that SIMPAR group publications were more likely to be saved (77.8% vs 45.9%), discussed (61.1% vs 1.1%, P<0.0001), and publicly viewed (11.1% vs 1.3%, P=0.05) than individual publications. These results support the importance of multidisciplinary research groups in the impact of scientific literature; the interaction and synergy among the research participants allowed the obtainment of high impact-literature in the field of personalized pain medicine. Finally, our findings demonstrate the potential of altmetrics in estimating the value of the research products of a group.

ID TRANSPARENCY
AB Transparency is both a powerful idea and a technology of power associated with accountability, justice and democracy, which opposes the secretive and shadowy power of surveillance wielded by states and corporations. This article examines surveillance and transparency not as a dichotomy but as a constitutive relation in the field of academia, focusing specifically on ranking and rivalry in the context of competitive performance. Transparency-as-openness (open access platforms) is enmeshed in enclosures assembled from (self-) surveillance, personal data, public institutions and private enterprise. The analysis pays particular attention to how altmetrics and credibility metrics -used to enhance personal prestige and professional standing reinforce the neo-liberalisation of higher education. The article concludes by engaging critically with the politics and poetics of open enclosures with a view to re-imagining the practice of academic freedom.

AB Social media is changing the way we interact, present ideas and information and judge the quality of content and contributions. In recent years there have been hundreds of platforms to freely share all kinds of information and connect across networks. These new tools generate activity statistics and interactions among users such as mentions, retweets, conversations, comments on blogs or Facebook; managers references showing popularity ratings of more references shared by other researchers or repositories that generate statistics of visits or downloads of articles. This paper analyzes that have meaning and implications altmetrics, what are its advantages and critical platforms (Almetric. com, ImpactStory, Plos altmetrics, PlumX), reports progress and benefits for authors, publishers and librarians. It concluded that the value of alternative metrics as a complementary tool citation analysis is evident, although it is suggested that you should dig deeper into this issue to unravel the meaning and the potential value of these indicators to assess their potential.

DT Article
AB Objective - In order to inform a library service related to creating and maintaining online scholarly profiles, we sought to assess the knowledge base and needs of our academic communities. Participants were queried about use, issues, and attitudes toward scholarly profile and altmetric tools, as well as the role librarians could play in assisting with the curation of online reputation.
   Methods - Semi-structured interviews with 18 scholar-practitioners and 5 graduate students from two mid-sized universities.
   Results - While all participants had Googled themselves, few were strategic about their online scholarly identity. Participants affirmed the perception that altmetrics can be of value in helping to craft a story of the value of their research and its diverse outputs. When participants had prior knowledge of altmetrics tools, it tended to be very narrow and deep, and perhaps field-specific. Participants identified time as the major barrier to use of scholarly profile and altmetrics tools.
   Conclusions - Librarians are well-placed to assist scholar-practitioners who wish to curate an online profile or use altmetrics tools. Areas of assistance include: personalized support, establishment of goals, orientation to specific tools, orientation to altmetrics and scholarly promotion landscape, preparing users for potential difficulties, discussing copyright implications, Open Access education, and guidance with packaging content for different venues and audiences.

AB In the past few decades the core of bibliometrics has predominantly been 'scientometric' in nature, due to the first commercial citation index having been created for scientific journals and articles. The production of citation indexes for books implies that proper education related to their use is now becoming critical. A new breed of humanistic bibliometrician can emerge successfully if well-trained lecturers are prepared to provide students with a foundation in mathematical indicator construction and a stimulating environment dedicated to problem-oriented learning. We examine some of the key principles and practices associated with teaching bibliometrics to humanists, with the aim of encouraging students to reflect upon new indicators relevant to scholarly research outputs across the humanities. Emphasis is placed on the "biblio" in bibliometrics (i. e., books), digital record-keeping across the humanities, the work of humanists who have sought to explain the development of new knowledge through objective pattern-seeking, and the complementary value of alternative versus traditional indicators of scholarly research performance.

AB A set of 12,436 papers published in 20 GIScience journals in the period 2000-2014 were analysed to extract publication patterns and trends. This comprehensive scientometric study focuses on multiple aspects: output volume, citations, national output and efficiency (output adjusted with econometric indicators), collaboration, altmetrics (Altmetric score, Twitter mentions, and Mendeley bookmarking), authorship, and length. Examples of notable observations are that 5% countries account for 76% of global GIScience output; a paper published 15 years ago received a median of 12 citations; and the share of international collaborations in GIScience has more than tripled since 2000 (31% papers had authors from multiple countries in 2014, an increase from 10% in 2000).

Given the subjective nature of the decision committees, there is a strong need for unbiased and objective procedures guaranteed by independent professionals. A neutral, comprehensive, modern, quantitative approach guided by academic librarians is proposed, including closeness to applicants, anonymity of their identities in the reports, contextualization (academic age, gender, and discipline) of data, usage of relative non-central values with indication of thresholds, and incorporation of new bibliometric and non-bibliometric sources.

AB In theory, articles can attract readers on the social reference sharing site Mendeley before they can attract citations, so Mendeley altmetrics could provide early indications of article impact. This article investigates the influence of time on the number of Mendeley readers of an article through a theoretical discussion and an investigation into the relationship between counts of readers of, and citations to, 4 general library and information science (LIS) journals. For this discipline, it takes about 7 years for articles to attract as many Scopus citations as Mendeley readers, and after this the Spearman correlation between readers and citers is stable at about 0.6 for all years. This suggests that Mendeley readership counts may be useful impact indicators for both newer and older articles. The lack of dates for individual Mendeley article readers and an unknown bias toward more recent articles mean that readership data should be normalized individually by year, however, before making any comparisons between articles published in different years.

ID CITATIONS
AB This brief communication presents preliminary findings on automated Twitter accounts distributing links to scientific articles deposited on the preprint repository arXiv. It discusses the implication of the presence of such bots from the perspective of social media metrics (altmetrics), where mentions of scholarly documents on Twitter have been suggested as a means of measuring impact that is both broader and timelier than citations. Our results show that automated Twitter accounts create a considerable amount of tweets to scientific articles and that they behave differently than common social bots, which has critical implications for the use of raw tweet counts in research evaluation and assessment. We discuss some definitions of Twitter cyborgs and bots in scholarly communication and propose distinguishing between different levels of engagementthat is, differentiating between tweeting only bibliographic information to discussing or commenting on the content of a scientific work.

ID RESEARCH IMPACT; CITATIONS; WEB
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential of altmetric and webometric indicators to aid with funding agencies' evaluations of their funding schemes.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses a range of altmetric and webometric indicators in terms of suitability for funding scheme evaluations, compares them to traditional indicators and reports some statistics derived from a pilot study with Wellcome Trust-associated publications.
   Findings - Some alternative indicators have advantages to usefully complement scientometric data by reflecting a different type of impact or through being available before citation data.
   Research limitations/implications - The empirical part of the results is based on a single case study and does not give statistical evidence for the added value of any of the indicators.
   Practical implications - A few selected alternative indicators can be used by funding agencies as part of their funding scheme evaluations if they are processed in ways that enable comparisons between data sets. Their evidence value is only weak, however.
   Originality/value - This is the first analysis of altmetrics or webometrics from a funding scheme evaluation perspective.

AB Based on the definition of the well-known h index we propose a t factor for measuring the impact of publications (and other entities) on Twitter. The new index combines tweet and retweet data in a balanced way, whereby retweets are seen as data reflecting the impact of initial tweets. The t factor is defined as follows: a unit (single publication, journal, researcher, research group etc.) has factor t if t of its Nt tweets have at least t retweets each and the other (Nt-t) tweets have <= t retweets each.

AB Purpose - Hicks et al. (2015) have formulated the so-called Leiden manifesto, in which they have assembled the ten principles for a meaningful evaluation of research on the basis of bibliometric data. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this work the attempt is made to indicate the relevance of the Leiden manifesto for altmetrics.
   Findings - As shown by the discussion of the ten principles against the background of the knowledge about and the research into altmetrics, the principles also have a great importance for altmetrics and should be taken into account in their application.
   Originality/value - Altmetrics is already frequently used in the area of research evaluation. Thus, it is important that the user of altmetrics data knows the relevance of the Leiden manifesto also in this area.

AB The increase in the availability of data about how research is discussed, used, rated, recommend, saved and read online has allowed researchers to reconsider the mechanisms by which scholarship is evaluated. It is now possible to better track the influence of research beyond academia, though the measures by which we can do so are not yet mature enough to stand on their own. In this article, we examine a new class of data (commonly called "altmetrics") and describe its benefits, limitations and recommendations for its use and interpretation in the context of research assessment. This article is published as part of a collection on the future of research assessment.

AB The present article analyzes the scientific communication that takes place on Twitter. Its aim is to understand and describe the types of scientific activities that occur on this platform, by identifying the type of information exchanged and the activities that researchers perform. Thus we attempt to better understand the number of times that research work is mentioned within a specific context. We followed a group of researchers and professionals with Twitter profiles who had published at least 3 articles in the journal EPI between 2009 and 2013. The research methodology was qualitative using virtual ethnography based on non-participant observation. Among the main conclusions, we found that researchers use Twitter mostly as a way to make their professional activity public and to disseminate their own research works or those of close collaborators, in order to give them more visibility and impact.

AB Aiming to explore the applicability of bookmarking data in measuring the scientific impact, the present study investigates the correlation between conventional impact indicators (i.e. impact factors and mean citations) and bookmarking metrics (mean bookmarks and percentage of bookmarked articles) at author and journal aggregation levels in library and information science (LIS) field. Applying the citation analysis method, it studies a purposeful sample of LIS articles indexed in SSCI during 2004-2012 and bookmarked in CiteULike. Data are collected via WoS, Journal Citation Report, and CiteULike. There is a positive, though weak, correlation between LIS authors' mean citations and their mean bookmarks, as well as a moderate to large correlation between LIS journals' impact factors on the one hand and on the other, their mean bookmarks, and the percentage of their bookmarked articles. Given the correlation between the citation- and bookmark-based indicators at author and journal levels, bookmarking data can be used as a complement to, but not a substitute for, the traditional indicators to get to a more inclusive evaluation of journals and authors.

AB An abstract construction for general weighted impact factors is introduced. We show that the classical weighted impact factors are particular cases of our model, but it can also be used for defining new impact measuring tools for other sources of information-as repositories of datasets-providing the mathematical support for a new family of altmetrics. Our aim is to show the main mathematical properties of this class of impact measuring tools, that hold as consequences of their mathematical structure and does not depend on the definition of any given index nowadays in use. In order to show the power of our approach in a well-known setting, we apply our construction to analyze the stability of the ordering induced in a list of journals by the 2-year impact factor (). We study the change of this ordering when the criterium to define it is given by the numerical value of a new weighted impact factor, in which is used for defining the weights. We prove that, if we assume that the weight associated to a citing journal increases with its , then the ordering given in the list by the new weighted impact factor coincides with the order defined by the . We give a quantitative bound for the errors committed. We also show two examples of weighted impact factors defined by weights associated to the prestige of the citing journal for the fields of MATHEMATICS and MEDICINE, GENERAL AND INTERNAL, checking if they satisfy the "increasing behavior" mentioned above.

AB This literature review describes web indicators for the impact of books, software, datasets, videos and other non-standard academic outputs. Although journal articles dominate academic research in the health and natural sciences, other types of outputs can make equally valuable contributions to scholarship and are more common in other fields. It is not always possible to get useful citation-based impact indicators for these due to their absence from, or incomplete coverage in, traditional citation indexes. In this context, the web is particularly valuable as a potential source of impact indicators for non-standard academic outputs. The main focus in this review is on books because of the much greater amount of relevant research for them and because they are regarded as particularly valuable in the arts and humanities and in some areas of the social sciences.

AB A number of indicators and metrics have been devised, especially in the past 10 to 15 years, to assist scholars in making a case for themselves and for their work. These metrics describe the impact of traditional venues (i.e. scholarly journals) as well as the impact of the scholars based on the number of times their work has been cited in traditional and nontraditional venues. Academic librarians assist faculty in explaining their impact and productivity in their respective fields in part through information published to their websites. Terms/concepts associated with common metrics relating to scholarly impact were searched in the library websites of the 62 Association of American University (AAU) members. A total of 61 libraries had web pages or LibGuides providing information on these topics, with Journal Citation Reports and the Impact Factor being the most commonly discussed (100%; 98.4%). Slightly over 90% (90.2%) supplied information about the h-index and 80.3% addressed altmetrics. We conclude that AAU librarians are assisting with the understanding and use of both traditional and new metrics as part of their service to their community of users. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The number of papers published in journals indexed by the Web of Science core collection is steadily increasing. In recent years, nearly two million new papers were published each year; somewhat more than one million papers when primary research papers are considered only (articles and reviews are the document types where primary research is usually reported or reviewed). However, who reads these papers? More precisely, which groups of researchers from which (self-assigned) scientific disciplines and countries are reading these papers? Is it possible to visualize readership patterns for certain countries, scientific disciplines, or academic status groups? One popular method to answer these questions is a network analysis. In this study, we analyze Mendeley readership data of a set of 1,133,224 articles and 64,960 reviews with publication year 2012 to generate three different networks: (1) The network based on disciplinary affiliations of Mendeley readers contains four groups: (i) biology, (ii) social sciences and humanities (including relevant computer sciences), (iii) bio-medical sciences, and (iv) natural sciences and engineering. In all four groups, the category with the addition "miscellaneous" prevails. (2) The network of co-readers in terms of professional status shows that a common interest in papers is mainly shared among PhD students, Master's students, and postdocs. (3) The country network focusses on global readership patterns: a group of 53 nations is identified as core to the scientific enterprise, including Russia and China as well as two thirds of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.

AB This article introduces the Multidimensional Research Assessment Matrix of scientific output. Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends on the unit of assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance, publication counts are useful tools to help discriminate between those staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared with one another according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics, including altmetrics, applied at the level of individual articles, individual researchers, research groups, and institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension. It introduces the concept of a meta-analysis of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process.

ID METRICS; IMPACT
AB An extensive analysis of the presence of different altmetric indicators provided by Altmetric.com across scientific fields is presented, particularly focusing on their relationship with citations. Our results confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications, with 15%-24% of the publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrated on the most recent publications, although their presence is increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences, humanities, and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but is relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same kind of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly-cited publications than journal citation scores. Altmetric scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are able to identify highly-cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation.

AB The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from 'A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology' by Poliseno et al. (2010), published in Nature in 2010. The key experiments to be replicated are reported in Figures 1D, 2F-H, and 4A. In these experiments, Poliseno and colleagues report microRNAs miR-19b and miR-20a transcriptionally suppress both PTEN and PTENP1 in prostate cancer cells (Figure 1D; Poliseno et al., 2010). Decreased expression of PTEN and/or PTENP1 resulted in downregulated PTEN protein levels (Figure 2H), downregulation of both mRNAs (Figure 2G), and increased tumor cell proliferation (Figure 2F; Poliseno et al., 2010). Furthermore, overexpression of the PTEN 3' UTR enhanced PTENP1 mRNA abundance limiting tumor cell proliferation, providing additional evidence for the co-regulation of PTEN and PTENP1 (Figure 4A; Poliseno et al., 2010). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange, and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

AB The extensive use of the web by many sectors of society has created the potential for new wider impact indicators. This article reviews research about Google Scholar and Google Patents, both of which can be used as sources of impact indicators for academic articles. It also briefly reviews methods to extract types of links and citations from the web as a whole, although the indicators that these generate are now probably too broad and too dominated by automatically generated websites, such as library and publisher catalogues, to be useful in practice. More valuable web-based indicators can be derived from specific types of web pages that cite academic research, such as online presentations, course syllabi, and science blogs. These provide evidence that is easier to understand and use and less likely to be affected by unwanted types of automatically generated content, although they are susceptible to gaming.

AB This literature review assesses indicators derived from social media sources, including both general and academic sites. Such indicators have been termed altmetrics, influmetrics, social media metrics, or a type of webometric, and have recently been commercialised by a number of companies and employed by some publishers and university administrators. The social media metrics analysed here derive mainly from Twitter, Facebook, Google+, F1000, Mendeley, ResearchGate, and Academia. edu. They have the apparent potential to deliver fast, free indicators of the wider societal impact of research, or of different types of academic impacts, complementing academic impact indicators from traditional citation indexes. Although it is unwise to employ them in formal evaluations with stakeholders, due to their susceptibility to gaming and lack of real evidence that they reflect wider research impacts, they are useful for formative evaluations and to investigate science itself. Mendeley reader counts are particularly promising.

AB Scientific social networks are a new meeting place for researchers and a major instrument for the promotion of knowledge. Their use is increasing in the scientific community, as they are practical tools to disseminate research results and to share knowledge. This paper examines the presence of 77 Spanish universities in the two main scientific social networks (ResearchGate and Academia.edu). The results show that, despite the continuous development that those networks are having worldwide, the number of Spanish members in them is considered insufficient and in some universities is almost anecdotal. These results should be the starting point for an action program of the universities to increase the membership of their academic staff in those networks, as part of their mission of disseminating knowledge.

AB This paper synthesises literature on the evolution of the academic journal, showing that the weaknesses of the journal strategy of science information dissemination are nothing new in the history of science. The paper avers that information technology has provided a solution to the age-long constraints associated with the journal. It is shown that by expanding the public's participation in science, and by enabling research results to be presented to the public in various formats, the rapid development in electronic technologies has touched the essential structure and functions of the journal. Formal and informal means of science dissemination and communication have emerged to blur the boundaries between journals, articles and ideas. Most significantly, the journal as an information product has been dismembered into different new and legitimate forms of the research effort, formerly packaged as a single product.

The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from 'Inhibition of bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) recruitment to chromatin as an effective treatment for mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-fusion leukemia' by Dawson and colleagues, published in Nature in 2011 (Dawson et al., 2011). The experiments to be replicated are those reported in Figures 2A, 3D, 4B, 4D and Supplementary Figures 11A-B and 16A. In this study, BET proteins were demonstrated as potential therapeutic targets for modulating aberrant gene expression programs associated with MLL-fusion leukemia. In Figure 2A, the BET bromodomain inhibitor I-BET151 was reported to suppress growth of cells harboring MLL-fusions compared to those with alternate oncogenic drivers. In Figure 3D, treatment of MLL-fusion leukemia cells with I-BET151 resulted in transcriptional suppression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2. Figures 4B and 4D tested the therapeutic efficacy of I-BET151 in vivo using mice injected with human MLL-fusion leukemia cells and evaluated disease progression following I-BET151 treatment. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

AB Little detailed information is known about who reads research articles and the contexts in which research articles are read. Using data about people who register in Mendeley as readers of articles, this article explores different types of users of Clinical Medicine, Engineering and Technology, Social Science, Physics, and Chemistry articles inside and outside academia. The majority of readers for all disciplines were PhD students, postgraduates, and postdocs but other types of academics were also represented. In addition, many Clinical Medicine articles were read by medical professionals. The highest correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts were found for types of users who often authored academic articles, except for associate professors in some sub-disciplines. This suggests that Mendeley readership can reflect usage similar to traditional citation impact if the data are restricted to readers who are also authors without the delay of impact measured by citation counts. At the same time, Mendeley statistics can also reveal the hidden impact of some research articles, such as educational value for nonauthor users inside academia or the impact of research articles on practice for readers outside academia.

AB The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by replicating selected results from a substantial number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from 'Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment' by Vermeulen and colleagues, published in Nature Cell Biology in 2010 (Vermeulen et al., 2010). The key experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 2F, 6D, and 7E. In these experiments, Vermeulen and colleagues utilize a reporter for Wnt activity and show that colon cancer cells with high levels of Wnt activity also express cancer stem cell markers (Figure 2F; Vermeulen et al., 2010). Additionally, treatment either with conditioned medium derived from myofibroblasts or with hepatocyte growth factor restored clonogenic potential in low Wnt activity colon cancer cells in vitro (Figure 6D; Vermeulen et al., 2010) and in vivo (Figure 7E; Vermeulen et al., 2010). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications will be published in eLife.

AB This paper compares the traditional tools of calculation for a journal's efficacy and visibility with the new tools that have arrived from the Internet, social media and search engines. The examples concern publications of orthopaedic surgery and in particular International Orthopaedics.
   Until recently, the prestige of publications, authors or journals was evaluated by the number of citations using the traditional citation metrics, most commonly the impact factor. Over the last few years, scientific medical literature has developed exponentially. The Internet has dramatically changed the way of sharing and the speed of flow of medical information. New tools have allowed readers from all over the world to access information and record their experience. Web platforms such as FacebookA (R) and TwitterA (R) have allowed for inputs from the general public. Professional sites such as LinkedInA (R) and more specialised sites such as ResearchGateA (R), BioMed CentralA (R) and OrthoEvidenceA (R) have provided specific information on defined fields of science. Scientific and professional blogs provide free access quality information. Therefore, in this new era of advanced wireless technology and online medical communication, the prestige of a paper should also be evaluated by alternative metrics (altmetrics) that measure the visibility of the scientific information by collecting Internet citations, number of downloads, number of hits on the Internet, number of tweets and likes of scholarly articles by newspapers, blogs, social media and other sources of data.
   This article provides insights into altmetrics and informs the reader about current tools for optimal visibility and citation of their work. It also includes useful information about the performance of International Orthopaedics and the bias between traditional publication metrics and the new alternatives.

ID MORTALITY; PUBLICATIONS
AB Purpose: This paper examines how federal statistics is used in scholarly research via a new type of citation analysis that leverages the strengths of information aggregators, like Altmetric LLP, in looking for evidence of government information use beyond traditional citations/references. In this citation analysis, abstracts were examined.
   Results: Drawing on a dataset containing articles aggregated via Altmetric Explorer, a querying interface provided by Altmetric LLP, content analysis was used to 1) determine the distribution of federal statistics incorporated in scholarly studies, and 2) qualitatively understand the particular ways in which studies incorporated federal statistics. It was found that the dominant source of federal statistics was the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), followed by the Census Bureau, and then the Bureau of labor Statistics. Prevalent qualitative themes underlying the studies in this dataset included mortality and population studies, linked datasets, international studies, and critical studies (i.e. presenting alternative measures for federal statistics).
   Conclusions: When querying studies referencing one or more of the principal US statistical agencies in Altmetric Explorer, almost all studies in the final dataset cited these agencies because they had cited federal statistics. This finding need not have been the case however. A separate study on the use of federal statistics in scholarly research will compare altmetrics to traditional citation analysis. Preliminary results from Google Scholar, using traditional citations, found non-dataset publications to be the most frequently cited titles from NCHS and the Census Bureau. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The data collected in altmetrics are not limited to calculating article level metrics, but have the potential to be used to generate journal and author metrics as well with new form of scholarly publication. Thus, altmetrics provides researchers and scholars both the new ways to track influence across a wide range of media and platforms. An attempt is made in this paper to discuss the term 'altmetrics' and its possible implications in library world.

AB An important and timely plenary session at the 2015 UKSG Conference and Exhibition focused on the role of metrics in research assessment. The two excellent speakers had slightly divergent views. Todd Carpenter from the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) argued that altmetrics are not alt(ernative) any more and that downloads and other forms of digital interaction, including social media reference, reference tracking, personal library saving and secondary linking activity now provide mainstream approaches to the assessment of scholarly impact. James Wilsdon is Professor of Science &. Democracy in the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex and is Chair of the Independent Review of the Role of Metrics in Research Assessment commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The outcome of this review will inform the work of HEFCE and the other UK higher education funding bodies as they prepare for the future of the Research Excellence Framework (REF). He is more circumspect, arguing that metrics cannot and should not be used as a substitute for informed judgement. This article provides a summary of both presentations.

ID SOCIETAL IMPACT; ADJUSTED PREDICTIONS
AB The increased interest in an impact measurement of research on other areas of the society than research has led in scientometrics to an investigation of altmetrics. Particular attention is paid here to a targeted broad impact measurement: The aim is to discover the impact which a particular publication set has on specific user groups (outside research) by using altmetrics. This study used the Mendeley application programming interface (API) to download the Mendeley counts (broken down by different user types of publications in Mendeley) for a comprehensive F1000Prime data set. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system for papers from the biomedical area. As the F1000 papers are provided with tags from experts in this area (Faculty members) which can characterise a paper more exactly (such as "good for teaching" or "new finding"), the interest of different user groups in specifically tagged papers could be investigated. This study's evaluation of the variously tagged F1000 papers provided interesting insights into the use of research papers by different user groups. The most interesting tag for altmetrics research is "good for teaching". This applies to papers which are well written and provide an overview of a topic. Papers with this tag can be expected to arouse interest among people who are hardly or not at all involved in research. The results of the regression models in this study do in fact show that lecturers, researchers at a non-academic institution, and others (such as librarians) have a special interest in this kind of papers. In the case of a key article in a field, or a particularly well written article that provides a good overview of a topic, then it will tend to be better received by people which are not particularly related to academic research.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the volume of individuals who viewed online versions of research articles in 2 peer-reviewed radiology journals and a radiology blog promoted by social media.
   Methods: The authors performed a retrospective study comparing online analytic logs of research articles in the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) and the American Journal of Roentgenology (AIR) and a blog posting on Radiopaedia.org from April 2013 to September 2014. All 3 articles addressed the topic of reporting incidental thyroid nodules detected on CT and MRI. The total page views for the research articles and the blog article were compared, and trends in page views were observed. Factors potentially affecting trends were an AJNR podcast and promotion of the blog article on the social media platforms Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter to followers of Radiopaedia.org in February 2014 and August 2014.
   Results: The total numbers of page views during the study period were 2,421 for the AJNR article and 3,064 for the AIR article. The Radiopaedia.org blog received 32,675 page views, which was 13.6 and 10.7 times greater than AJNR and AIR page views, respectively, and 6.0 times greater than both journal articles combined. Months with activity above average for the blog and the AJNR article coincided with promotion by Radiopaedia.org on social media.
   Conclusions: Dissemination of scientific material on a radiology blog promoted on social media can substantially augment the reach of more traditional publication venues. Although peer-reviewed publication remains the most widely accepted measure of academic productivity, researchers in radiology should not ignore opportunities for increasing the impact of research findings via social media.

AB Publication of research, innovation, challenges and successes is of critical importance to the evolution of more effective distance education programming. Publication in peer reviewed journal format is the most prestigious and the most widespread form of dissemination in education and most other disciplines, thus the importance of understanding what is published and its impact on both researchers and practitioners. In this article we identify and classify the leading articles in arguably the leading peer reviewed journals in this discipline.
   The journal The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning (IRRODL) is a peer reviewed academic journal that has been published since 2000. The journal has published between 3 and 6 issues annually with between 50 and 111 research articles per volume. In order to assess the general and the particular impact of highly cited articles this work describes the main bibliometric indicators of the IRRODL journal and these are compared with the total galley views in all formats, PDF, HTML, EPUB and MP3, that IRRODL publishes. In addition to identifying characteristics of the most widely cited articles this research determines if there is a correlation between the articles most highly cited by other publishing researchers and the number of views, indicating interest from both practitioners and research communities. The results show a significant and positive relationship between the total number of citations and the number of views received by articles published in the journal, indicating the impact of the journal extends beyond active publishers to practitioner consumers.

AB Alternative metrics are currently one of the most popular research topics in scientometric research. This paper provides an overview of research into three of the most important altmetrics: microblogging (Twitter), online reference managers (Mendeley and CiteULike) and blogging. The literature is discussed in relation to the possible use of altmetrics in research evaluation. Since the research was particularly interested in the correlation between altmetrics counts and citation counts, this overview focuses particularly on this correlation. For each altmetric, a meta-analysis is calculated for its correlation with traditional citation counts. As the results of the meta-analyses show, the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging counts is negligible (pooled r = 0.003), for blog counts it is small (pooled r = 0.12) and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, medium to large (CiteULike pooled r = 0.23; Mendeley pooled r = 0.51).

AB In this study, we compare the difference in the impact between open access (OA) and non-open access (non-OA) articles. 1761 Nature Communications articles published from 1 January 2012 to 31 August 2013 are selected as our research objects, including 587 OA articles and 1174 non-OA articles. Citation data and daily updated article-level metrics data are harvested directly from the platform of nature.com. Data is analyzed from the static versus temporal-dynamic perspectives. The OA citation advantage is confirmed, and the OA advantage is also applicable when extending the comparing from citation to article views and social media attention. More important, we find that OA papers not only have the great advantage of total downloads, but also have the feature of keeping sustained and steady downloads for a long time. For article downloads, non-OA papers only have a short period of attention, when the advantage of OA papers exists for a much longer time.

AB This article provides an introduction to the use of altmetrics as a tool to assess research impact. In particular, it looks at the evidence behind claims that altmetrics allow the impact of research to be measured in days rather than years. Low correlations between altmetrics and article citations make it doubtful that altmetrics can reliably predict future citations. In addition, there are good reasons to qualify statements that altmetrics measure the wider impact of research on society. Librarians should be careful not to overstate the value of altmetrics when recommending their use as a complement to more traditional measures of research quality.

AB Journal impact factors (JIFs) are widely used and promoted but have important limitations. In particular, JIFs can be unduly influenced by individual highly cited articles and hence are inherently unstable. A logical way to reduce the impact of individual high citation counts is to use the geometric mean rather than the standard mean in JIF calculations. Based upon journal rankings 2004-2014 in 50 sub-categories within 5 broad categories, this study shows that journal rankings based on JIF variants tend to be more stable over time if the geometric mean is used rather than the standard mean. The same is true for JIF variants using Mendeley reader counts instead of citation counts. Thus, although the difference is not large, the geometric mean is recommended instead of the arithmetic mean for future JIF calculations. In addition, Mendeley readership-based JIF variants are as stable as those using Scopus citations, confirming the value of Mendeley readership as an academic impact indicator. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Alternative metrics or "altmetrics" can be defined as the study and use of academic impact measures based on the activity of online tools and environments. Altmetrics aim to measure the different forms and patterns of meaning and use of scientific products, looking not only for publishing in traditional media, but also the broader process of dissemination in emerging environments. Its goal is to update the scientific concept of influence in a century characterized by the rapid spread of information and adoption of social media on a global scale. This paper presents the altmetrics and analyses its application to assess academic impact.

SO PLOS ONE

ID CITATION ANALYSIS; IMPACT; AUTHORSHIP; COUNTS; TWEETS; WORDS; TITLE
AB A number of new metrics based on social media platforms-grouped under the term "altmetrics" - have recently been introduced as potential indicators of research impact. Despite their current popularity, there is a lack of information regarding the determinants of these metrics. Using publication and citation data from 1.3 million papers published in 2012 and covered in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science as well as social media counts from Altmetric. com, this paper analyses the main patterns of five social media metrics as a function of document characteristics (i.e., discipline, document type, title length, number of pages and references) and collaborative practices and compares them to patterns known for citations. Results show that the presence of papers on social media is low, with 21.5% of papers receiving at least one tweet, 4.7% being shared on Facebook, 1.9% mentioned on blogs, 0.8% found on Google+ and 0.7% discussed in mainstream media. By contrast, 66.8% of papers have received at least one citation. Our findings show that both citations and social media metrics increase with the extent of collaboration and the length of the references list. On the other hand, while editorials and news items are seldom cited, it is these types of document that are the most popular on Twitter. Similarly, while longer papers typically attract more citations, an opposite trend is seen on social media platforms. Finally, contrary to what is observed for citations, it is papers in the Social Sciences and humanities that are the most often found on social media platforms. On the whole, these findings suggest that factors driving social media and citations are different. Therefore, social media metrics cannot actually be seen as alternatives to citations; at most, they may function as complements to other type of indicators.

AB This article reflects the comparison of downloads, readership and citation data for the Journal of Medical Hypotheses and Ideas. A brief analysis of the journal's recent performance indicates that the journal articles appear to have a high rate of downloads around the world. Its published articles are from a variety of countries and the odds of accepted articles for publication is surprisingly even across regions. However, the rate of received citations to the published articles indicated a lack of considerable impact in scholarly publications. This approach has double value as it shows the overall impact of the journal in social web as well as scholarly publications and also provides future directions for the journal's editorial boards. Altmetrics was also proposed as an alternative to the widely used citation and usage indicators in tracking the impact of individual articles. (C) 2014 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB An analysis of article-level metrics of 27,856 PLOS ONE articles reveals that the number of tweets was weakly associated with the number of citations (beta = 0.10), and weakly negatively associated with citations when the number of article views was held constant (beta = -0.06). The number of tweets was predictive of other social media activity (beta = 0.34 for Mendeley and beta = 0.41 for Facebook), but not of the number of article views on PubMed Central (beta = 0.01). It is concluded that the scientific citation process acts relatively independently of the social dynamics on Twitter.

AB In this paper, I present the evaluation of a novel knowledge domain the visualisation of educational technology. The interactive visualisation is based on readership patterns in the online reference management system Mendeley. It comprises of 13 topic areas, spanning psychological, pedagogical, and methodological foundations, learning methods and technologies, and social and technological developments. The visualisation was evaluated with: (1) a qualitative comparison to knowledge domain visualisations based on citations, and (2) expert interviews. The results show that the co-readership visualisation is a recent representation of pedagogical and psychological research in educational technology. Furthermore, the co-readership analysis covers more areas than comparable visualisations based on co-citation patterns. Areas related to computer science, however, are missing from the co-readership visualisation and more research is needed to explore the interpretations of size and placement of research areas on the map.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand individual academics' perception, attitudes and participation in Open Access Publishing and open scholarship and revisit some principles and designs of openness in academic publishing from the perspective of creative end-users, which helps to increase the sustainability and efficiency of open models.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on a case study of China and empirical data collected through semi-structured interviews with a wide range of academics and stakeholders.
   Findings - A separation between the communication and certification functions of publishing is identified: open initiatives are valued for efficient and interactive communication while traditional publishing still dominates the legitimacy of research publications, which leads to the quandary of individual academics operating within the transitional landscape of scholarly communication.
   Practical implications - Practical recommendations for sustainable and efficient openness are derived from discussions on the difficulties associated open/social certification and the shifting maxims that govern academics from "publish or perish" to "be visible or vanish".
   Originality/value - "Openness" is defined in broad sense integrating Open Access and open scholarship to comprehensively reflect individual academics' views in the transitional landscape of academic publishing. The research findings suggest that new open approaches are needed to address the evolving tension and conflicts between communication and certification.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to encourage recognition of the potential impact of an increasingly complicated information ecosystem on scientometric indicators.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper considers how new web technologies have impacted the role of time in scientometric indicators.
   Findings - The paper suggests that it is important to be aware of the limitations of scientometrics indicators in an increasingly complicated information environment, although without a more developed semantic web there is little that can be done.
   Practical implications - Users of scientometric indicators should refrain from claiming too much confidence in them.
   Originality/value - The paper considers scientometric indicators at a finer granularity that usual, and will be of interest to anyone concerned the application of bibliometric indicators and the changing nature of scientific discourse.

AB The emergence of social media, including social networking technologies, has had a profound impact on almost all human activities. Social media's application in research is the most recent occurrence, as the technologies have gained prominence among researchers who regard social media as an avenue for not only strengthening their own networks, but also sharing their research. This article focuses on one of the social networking services for researchers, namely ResearchGate (RG), to assess the research visibility and impact of universities in South Africa. It also examines the correlation between the universities' ResearchGate-based metrics and Web of Science (WoS) citation statistics on the one hand, and the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities' (WRWU) ranking on the other. Results reveal that researchers in the top-ranking South African universities have quickly moved to embrace social media; there is a high correlation between RG and WoS in terms of their coverage of papers produced by universities in South Africa; there is also a high correlation between RG and WoS in terms of impact; and ranking of universities in RG, WoS and WRWU is similarly highly correlated. Further discussions, conclusions and recommendations are provided in the paper.

Publishers', editors', and authors' challenges" at the IUFRO XXIV world conference, organized by Pekka Nygren and Eeva Korpilahti from the Finnish Society of Forest Science. The presenters dealt with the topical problems of publishing scientific knowledge from different perspectives. The talks covered the development of journals, publications and submissions, benefits and drawbacks of open access publishing as well as electronic and traditional publishing, and possibilities to promote interesting papers either from the journal's or from the author's perspective, and the problems of disseminating the scientific results to the end users. In this paper, a few prevalent viewpoints, inspired by the session, are raised and discussed with some suggestions included.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the disciplinary orientation of scientific publications that were mentioned on different social media platforms, focussing on their differences and similarities with citation counts.
   Design/methodology/approach - Social media metrics and readership counts, associated with 500,216 publications and their citation data from the Web of Science database, were collected from Altmetric.com and Mendeley. Results are presented through descriptive statistical analyses together with science maps generated with VOSviewer.
   Findings - The results confirm Mendeley as the most prevalent social media source with similar characteristics to citations in their distribution across fields and their density in average values per publication. The humanities, natural sciences, and engineering disciplines have a much lower presence of social media metrics. Twitter has a stronger focus on general medicine and social sciences. Other sources (blog, Facebook, Google+, and news media mentions) are more prominent in regards to multidisciplinary journals.
   Originality/value - This paper reinforces the relevance of Mendeley as a social media source for analytical purposes from a disciplinary perspective, being particularly relevant for the social sciences (together with Twitter). Key implications for the use of social media metrics on the evaluation of research performance (e.g. the concentration of some social media metrics, such as blogs, news items, etc., around multidisciplinary journals) are identified.

ID IMPACT; PUBLICATIONS; QUALITY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the value of Goodreads reader ratings for measuring the wider impact of scholarly books published in the field of History.
   Design/methodology/approach - Book titles were extracted from the reference lists of articles that appeared in 604 history journals indexed in Scopus (2007-2011). The titles were cleaned and matched with WorldCat.org (for publisher information) as well as Goodreads (for reader ratings) using an API. A set of 8,538 books was first filtered based on Dewey Decimal Classification class 900 "History and Geography", then a subset of 997 books with the highest citations and reader ratings (i.e. top 25 per cent) was analysed separately based on additional characteristics.
   Findings - A weak correlation (0.212) was found between citation counts and reader rating counts for the full data set (n = 8,538). An additional correlation for the subset of 997 books indicated a similar weak correlation (0.190). Further correlations between citations, reader ratings, written reviews, and library holdings indicate that a reader rating on Goodreads was more likely to be given to a book held in an international library, including both public and academic libraries.
   Originality/value - Research on altmetrics has focused almost exclusively on scientific journal articles appearing on social media services (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). In this paper we show the potential of Goodreads reader ratings to identify the impact of books beyond academia. As a unique altmetric data source, Goodreads can allow scholarly authors from the social sciences and humanities to measure the wider impact of their books.

DE Social media; Affordance; Impression management; Altmetrics; Twitter;
   Frame analysis
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show that there were differences in the use of Twitter by professors at AAU schools. Affordance use differed between the personal and professional tweets of professors as categorized by turkers. Framing behaviors were described that could impact the interpretation of tweets by audience members.
   Design/methodology/approach - A three phase research design was used that included surveys of professors, categorization of tweets by workers in Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and categorization of tweets by active professors on Twitter.
   Findings - There were significant differences found between professors that reported having a Twitter account, significant differences found between types of Twitter accounts (personal, professional, or both), and significant differences in the affordances used in personal and professional tweets. Framing behaviors were described that may assist altmetric researchers in distinguishing between personal and professional tweets.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by the sample population, survey instrument, low survey response rate, and low Cohen's kappa.
   Practical implications - An overview of various affordances found in Twitter is provided and a novel use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk for the categorization of tweets is described that can be applied to future altmetric studies.
   Originality/value - This work utilizes a socio-technical framework integrating social and psychological theories to interpret results from the tweeting behavior of professors and the interpretation of tweets by workers in Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

AB Emerging metrics based on article-level does not exclude traditional metrics based on citations to the journal, but complements them. Both can be employed in conjunction to offer a richer picture of an article use from immediate to long terms. Article-level metrics (ALM) is the result of the aggregation of different data sources and the collection of content from multiple social network services. Sources used for the aggregation can be broken down into five categories: usage, captures, mentions, social media and citations. Data sources depend on the tool, but they include classic metrics indicators based on citations, academic social networks (Mendeley, CiteULike, Delicious) and social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs, or Youtube, among others). Altmetrics is not synonymous with alternative metrics. Altmetrics are normally early available and allow to assess the social impact of scholarly outputs, almost at the real time. This paper overviews briefly the meaning of altmetrics and describes some of the existing tools used to apply this new metrics: Public Library of Science-Article-Level Metrics, Altmetric, Impactstory and Plum.

SO HERALD OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

DT Article
AB Alternative metrics (altmetrics) as a possible substitute for or addition to the traditional methods of assessing scientific results based on opinions and bibliometric indicators were first proposed in 2010. Since then, metric indicators, primarily those based on accounting for the use and discussion of scientific publications on the Internet, have, on the one hand, found influential advocates among scientists and publishers and, on the other, been met with resistance on the part of equally authoritative participants in the market of scientific publications. Altmetrics are already used actively by the largest publishers; in June 2014, the American National Information Standards Organization developed a draft altmetrics standard. This article presents a review of the existing indicators, describes their target audience, and considers leading companies that develop software products on altmetrics calculation for users of different categories. Altmetrics and citation-based indicators are compared.

AB In this paper, we analyze the adequacy and applicability of readership statistics recorded in social reference management systems for creating knowledge domain visualizations. First, we investigate the distribution of subject areas in user libraries of educational technology researchers on Mendeley. The results show that around 69% of the publications in an average user library can be attributed to a single subject area. Then, we use co-readership patterns to map the field of educational technology. The resulting visualization prototype, based on the most read publications in this field on Mendeley, reveals 13 topic areas of educational technology research. The visualization is a recent representation of the field: 80% of the publications included were published within ten years of data collection. The characteristics of the readers, however, introduce certain biases to the visualization. Knowledge domain visualizations based on readership statistics are therefore multifaceted and timely, but it is important that the characteristics of the underlying sample are made transparent.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of how the potential of altmetrics varies around the world by measuring the percentage of articles with non-zero metrics (coverage) for articles published from a developing region (Latin America).
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses article metadata from a prominent Latin American journal portal, SciELO, and combines it with altmetrics data from Altmetric.com and with data collected by author-written scripts. The study is primarily descriptive, focusing on coverage levels disaggregated by year, country, subject area, and language.
   Findings - Coverage levels for most of the social media sources studied was zero or negligible. Only three metrics had coverage levels above 2 per cent - Mendeley, Twitter, and Facebook. Of these, Twitter showed the most significant differences with previous studies. Mendeley coverage levels reach those found by previous studies, but it takes up to two years longer for articles to be saved in the reference manager. For the most recent year, coverage was less than half than what was found in previous studies. The coverage levels of Facebook appear similar (around 3 per cent) to that of previous studies.
   Research limitations/implications - The Altmetric.com data used for some of the analyses were collected for a six month period. For other analyses, Altmetric. com data were only available for a single country (Brazil).
   Originality/value - The results of this study have implications for the altmetrics research community and for any stakeholders interested in using altmetrics for evaluation. It suggests the need of careful sample selection when wishing to make generalizable claims about altmetrics.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this case study is to investigate the usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader impact of research.
   Design/methodology/approach - This case study is based on a sample of 1,082 the Public Library of Science (PLOS) journal articles recommended in F1000. The data set includes altmetrics which were provided by PLOS. The F1000 data set contains tags on papers which were assigned by experts to characterise them.
   Findings - The most relevant tag for altmetric research is "good for teaching", as it is assigned to papers which could be of interest to a wider circle of readers than the peers in a specialised area. One could expect papers with this tag to be mentioned more often on Facebook and Twitter than those without this tag. The results from regression models were able to confirm these expectations: papers with this tag show significantly higher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers without this tag. This clear association could not be seen with Mendeley or Figshare counts (that is with counts from platforms which are chiefly of interest in a scientific context).
   Originality/value - The results of the current study indicate that Facebook and Twitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, might provide an indication of which papers are of interest to a broader circle of readers (and not only for the peers in a specialist area), and could therefore be useful for the measurement of the societal impact of research.

AB This study elaborates on the relationship between social media and communication science, setting the emerging field of altmetris for the analysis of this relationship. The study presents the results of a research project that aimed to analyse alternative metrics to 125 articles of Brazilian Information Science journals. Through Altmetric.com, 45 of the 125 items returned altmetrics data. The journal Ciencia da Informacao obtained better results than the others, with 21 articles and 297 altmetrics data. In regards to social media, around 92,43% of the data collected was taken from Mendeley's library, while 7,57% of the mentions were from Twitter, and no data was recovered from Facebook. We consider that the lack of standardization for magazines can be a factor in the reduced quantity of articles found, and the parameterization of Application Programming Interface of social media such as Facebook and Twitter can be the answer to overcome this low number for the recovered data. The altmetric data indicates the attention that the articles receive on socialweb shortly after their publication and may be a suggestion of future citations.

AB This study explores the connections between social and usage metrics (altmetrics) and bibliometric indicators at the author level. It studies to what extent these indicators, gained from academic sites, can provide a proxy for research impact. Close to 10,000 author profiles belonging to the Spanish National Research Council were extracted from the principal scholarly social sites: ResearchGate, Academia.edu and Mendeley and academic search engines: Microsoft Academic Search and Google Scholar Citations. Results describe little overlapping between sites because most of the researchers only manage one profile (72%). Correlations point out that there is scant relationship between altmetric and bibliometric indicators at author level. This is due to the almetric ones are site-dependent, while the bibliometric ones are more stable across web sites. It is concluded that altmetrics could reflect an alternative dimension of the research performance, close, perhaps, to science popularization and networking abilities, but far from citation impact.

SO NEW LIBRARY WORLD

DT Article
DE Altmetrics; Academic social networking; ResearchGate; Scopus
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the study aims to investigate the relationship between the altmetric indicators from ResearchGate (RG) and the bibliometric indicators from the Scopus database. Second, the study seeks to examine the relationship amongst the RG altmetric indicators themselves. RG is a rich source of altmetric indicators such as Citations, RGScore, Impact Points, Profile Views, Publication Views, etc.
   Design/methodology/approach - For establishing whether RG metrics showed the same results as the established sources of metrics, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated between the metrics provided by RG and the metrics obtained from Scopus. Pearson's correlation coefficients were also calculated for the metrics provided by RG. The data were collected by visiting the profile pages of all the members who had an account in RG under the Department of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh (India).
   Findings - The study showed that most of the RG metrics showed strong positive correlation with the Scopus metrics, except for RGScore (RG) and Citations (Scopus), which showed moderate positive correlation. It was also found that the RG metrics showed moderate to strong positive correlation amongst each other.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is that more and more scientists and researchers may join RG in the future, therefore the data may change. The study focuses on the members who had an account in RG under the Department of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh (India). Perhaps further studies can be conducted by increasing the sample size and by taking a different sample size having different characteristics.
   Originality/value - Being an emerging field, not much has been conducted in the area of altmetrics. Very few studies have been conducted on the reach of academic social networks like RG and their validity as sources of altmetric indicators like RGScore, Impact Points, etc. The findings offer insights to the question whether RG can be used as an alternative to traditional sources of bibliometric indicators, especially with reference to a rapidly developing country such as India.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to detect and describe disciplinary differences in the users and use of several social networking sites by scientists.
   Design/methodology/approach - Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) (Spanish National Research Council) researchers registered in the most currently relevant academic social network sites (Google Scholar Citations, Academia.edu, ResearchGate (RG) and Mendeley) were analysed. In total, 6,132 profiles were classified according the eight research areas of the CSIC.
   Findings - Results show that Academia.edu is massively populated by humanists and social scientists, while RG is popular among biologists. Disciplinary differences are observed across every platform. Thus, scientists from the humanities and social sciences and natural resources show a significant activity contacting other members. On the contrary, biologists are more passive using social tools.
   Originality/value - This is the first study that analyses the disciplinary performance of a same sample of researchers on a varied number of academic social sites, comparing their numbers across web sites.

AB Research output and impact metrics derived from commercial citation databases such as Web of Science and Scopus have become the de facto indicators of scholarly performance across different disciplines and regions. However, it has been pointed out that the existing metrics are largely inadequate to reflect scholars' overall peer-mediated performance, especially in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) where publication channels are more diverse. In this paper alternative metrics exploring a variety of formal and informal communication channels were proposed, with the aim of better reflecting SSH scholarship. Data for a group of SSH scholars in Taiwan on these metrics were collected. Principal component analysis revealed four underlying dimensions represented by the 18 metrics. Multiple-regression analyses were then performed to examine how well each of these dimensions predicted the academic standing of the scholars, measured by the number of public grants awarded and prestigious research awards received. Differences in the significance of the predictors were found between the social sciences and humanities. The results suggest the need to consider disciplinary differences when evaluating scholarly performance.

AB Activity of modern scholarship creates online footprints galore. Along with traditional metrics of research quality, such as citation counts, online images of researchers and institutions increasingly matter in evaluating academic impact, decisions about grant allocation, and promotion. We examined 400 biographical Wikipedia articles on academics from four scientific fields to test if being featured in the world's largest online encyclopedia is correlated with higher academic notability (assessed through citation counts). We found no statistically significant correlation between Wikipedia articles metrics (length, number of edits, number of incoming links from other articles, etc.) and academic notability of the mentioned researchers. We also did not find any evidence that the scientists with better WP representation are necessarily more prominent in their fields. In addition, we inspected the Wikipedia coverage of notable scientists sampled from Thomson Reuters list of `highly cited researchers'. In each of the examined fields, Wikipedia failed in covering notable scholars properly. Both findings imply that Wikipedia might be producing an inaccurate image of academics on the front end of science. By shedding light on how public perception of academic progress is formed, this study alerts that a subjective element might have been introduced into the hitherto structured system of academic evaluation.

AB The prospects of altmetrics are especially encouraging for research fields in the humanities that currently are difficult to study using established bibliometric methods. Yet, little is known about the altmetric impact of research fields in the humanities. Consequently, this paper analyses the altmetric coverage and impact of humanities-oriented articles and books published by Swedish universities during 2012. Some of the most common altmetric sources are examined using a sample of 310 journal articles and 54 books. Mendeley has the highest coverage of journal articles (61%) followed by Twitter (21%) while very few of the publications are mentioned in blogs or on Facebook. Books, on the other hand, are quite often tweeted while both Mendeley's and the novel data source Library Thing's coverage is low. Many of the problems of applying bibliometrics to the humanities are also relevant for altmetric approaches; the importance of non-journal publications, the reliance on print as well the limited coverage of non-English language publications. However, the continuing development and diversification of methods suggests that altmetrics could evolve into a valuable tool for assessing research in the humanities.

AB This paper investigates disciplinary differences in how researchers use the microblogging site Twitter. Tweets from selected researchers in ten disciplines (astrophysics, biochemistry, digital humanities, economics, history of science, cheminformatics, cognitive science, drug discovery, social network analysis, and sociology) were collected and analyzed both statistically and qualitatively. The researchers tended to share more links and retweet more than the average Twitter users in earlier research and there were clear disciplinary differences in how they used Twitter. Biochemists retweeted substantially more than researchers in the other disciplines. Researchers in digital humanities and cognitive science used Twitter more for conversations, while researchers in economics shared the most links. Finally, whilst researchers in biochemistry, astrophysics, cheminformatics and digital humanities seemed to use Twitter for scholarly communication, scientific use of Twitter in economics, sociology and history of science appeared to be marginal.

ID CITATION ANALYSIS
AB Altmetrics, indices based on social media platforms and tools, have recently emerged as alternative means of measuring scholarly impact. Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products in the social web. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians examining both their own use of online platforms and the use of their papers on social reference managers. As expected, coverage varied: 82 % of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28 % were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation counts. We conducted a survey among the participants of the STI2012 participants. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68 % of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72 % valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.

AB In this paper an analysis of the presence and possibilities of altmetrics for bibliometric and performance analysis is carried out. Using the web based tool Impact Story, we collected metrics for 20,000 random publications from the Web of Science. We studied both the presence and distribution of altmetrics in the set of publications, across fields, document types and over publication years, as well as the extent to which altmetrics correlate with citation indicators. The main result of the study is that the altmetrics source that provides the most metrics is Mendeley, with metrics on readerships for 62.6% of all the publications studied, other sources only provide marginal information. In terms of relation with citations, a moderate spearman correlation (r = 0.49) has been found between Mendeley readership counts and citation indicators. Other possibilities and limitations of these indicators are discussed and future research lines are outlined.

AB Citations are increasingly used for research evaluations. It is therefore important to identify factors affecting citation scores that are unrelated to scholarly quality or usefulness so that these can be taken into account. Regression is the most powerful statistical technique to identify these factors and hence it is important to identify the best regression strategy for citation data. Citation counts tend to follow a discrete lognormal distribution and, in the absence of alternatives, have been investigated with negative binomial regression. Using simulated discrete lognormal data (continuous lognormal data rounded to the nearest integer) this article shows that a better strategy is to add one to the citations, take their log and then use the general linear (ordinary least squares) model for regression (e. g., multiple linear regression, ANOVA), or to use the generalised linear model without the log. Reasonable results can also be obtained if all the zero citations are discarded, the log is taken of the remaining citation counts and then the general linear model is used, or if the generalised linear model is used with the continuous lognormal distribution. Similar approaches are recommended for altmetric data, if it proves to be lognormally distributed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Academics can now use the web and the social websites to disseminate scholarly information in a variety of different ways. Although some scholars have taken advantage of these new online opportunities, it is not clear how widespread their uptake is or how much impact they can have. This study assesses the extent to which successful scientists have social web presences, focusing on one influential group: highly cited researchers working at European institutions. It also assesses the impact of these presences. We manually and systematically identified if the European highly cited researchers had profiles in Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Mendeley, Academia and LinkedIn or any content in SlideShare. We then used URL mentions and altmetric indicators to assess the impact of the web presences found. Although most of the scientists had an institutional website of some kind, few had created a profile in any social website investigated, and LinkedIn-the only non-academic site in the list-was the most popular. Scientists having one kind of social web profile were more likely to have another in many cases, especially in the life sciences and engineering. In most cases it was possible to estimate the relative impact of the profiles using a readily available statistic and there were disciplinary differences in the impact of the different kinds of profiles. Most social web profiles had some evidence of uptake, if not impact; nevertheless, the value of the indicators used is unclear.

AB Today, it is not clear how the impact of research on other areas of society than science should be measured. While peer review and bibliometrics have become standard methods for measuring the impact of research in science, there is not yet an accepted framework within which to measure societal impact. Alternative metrics (called altmetrics to distinguish them from bibliometrics) are considered an interesting option for assessing the societal impact of research, as they offer new ways to measure (public) engagement with research output. Altmetrics is a term to describe web-based metrics for the impact of publications and other scholarly material by using data from social media platforms (e. g. Twitter or Mendeley). This overview of studies explores the potential of altmetrics for measuring societal impact. It deals with the definition and classification of altmetrics. Furthermore, their benefits and disadvantages for measuring impact are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ADJUSTED PREDICTIONS
AB Can altmetric data be validly used for the measurement of societal impact? The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag "good for teaching" do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented ("new finding"). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact.
   If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics.

AB Introduction. Traditional measures of the impact of published research, such as citation counts, are limited to measuring academic impact. The use of social media and other online tools as alternative measures of research impact is gaining popularity and used by leading medical journals.
   Methods. MEDLINE was searched for articles published with subject headings relating to solid organ transplantation between August 1, 2011, and July 31, 2012. Citation data were retrieved from SCOPUS, and statistics regarding mentions in social media, social bookmarking sites, news outlets, and expert recommendation sites were retrieved from the data at www.altmetric.com. Data were analyzed for associations between alternative metric data and citation rates.
   Results. The search retrieved 6,981 publications. Sixty-six percent of the articles had at least one citation. Mentions in social media were 19.3%, 13.1% had social bookmarks, 0.9% had expert recommendations, and online news outlets picked up eight articles. Significantly higher citation rates were associated with mention in social media, expert recommendation, social bookmarking, and for articles identified as meta-analyses, multicenter studies, randomized controlled trials, and reviews (all P<0.001). The odds of an article being highly cited were significantly increased by a mention in social media (odds ratio, 2.58; P<0.001). Qualitative analysis suggests that article topics discussed on social media are more likely to relate to the more controversial and emotive areas of transplantation.
   Discussion. Social media and online attention act as early predictors of the impact of transplant research as measured by later citation rate. Blogging and expert recommendation, in particular, are associated with higher citation rates.

DT Article
AB Because Twitter and other social media are increasingly used for analyses based on altmetrics, this research sought to understand what contexts, affordance use, and social activities influence the tweeting behavior of astrophysicists. Thus, the presented study has been guided by three research questions that consider the influence of astrophysicists' activities (i.e., publishing and tweeting frequency) and of their tweet construction and affordance use (i.e. use of hashtags, language, and emotions) on the conversational connections they have on Twitter. We found that astrophysicists communicate with a variety of user types (e.g. colleagues, science communicators, other researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different professional roles can be distinguished. Interestingly, the analysis of noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address the different groups of very different professional composition they use very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.e. mentioning other user names in tweets). The results also showed that in those areas of the ego networks that tweeted more the sentiment of the tweets tended to be closer to neutral, connecting frequent tweeting with information sharing activities rather than conversations or expressing opinions.

AB Although there is evidence that counting the readers of an article in the social reference site, Mendeley, may help to capture its research impact, the extent to which this is true for different scientific fields is unknown. In this study, we compare Mendeley readership counts with citations for different social sciences and humanities disciplines. The overall correlation between Mendeley readership counts and citations for the social sciences was higher than for the humanities. Low and medium correlations between Mendeley bookmarks and citation counts in all the investigated disciplines suggest that these measures reflect different aspects of research impact. Mendeley data were also used to discover patterns of information flow between scientific fields. Comparing information flows based on Mendeley bookmarking data and cross-disciplinary citation analysis for the disciplines revealed substantial similarities and some differences. Thus, the evidence from this study suggests that Mendeley readership data could be used to help capture knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines, especially for people that read but do not author articles, as well as giving impact evidence at an earlier stage than is possible with citation counts.

DE impact factor; research assessment; altmetrics; scholarly communication
AB Despite nearly 350years of practice, we still do a fairly poor job of measuring the quality and impact of scholarly papers and the work of individual researchers. Much of our system for determining funding and career advancement revolves around one metric: the impact factor. Technology has progressed to a point where we can do better. We can now track the life of each individual paper after it has been published and better understand how it is read and how it is used. This creates a tremendous opportunity for new alternative metrics ("altmetrics") to give us a much better sense of a paper's true impact. At the same time, we are now faced with an overwhelming quantity of information and seemingly unlimited ways to analyze a researcher's work. How do we separate out the digital needles from the haystack-the signal from the noise-and create useful tools for research assessment?

AB This paper analyzes Altmetric.com, one of the most important altmetric data providers currently used. We have analyzed a set of publications with doi number indexed in the Web of Science during the period 2011-2013 and collected their data with the Altmetric API. 19% of the original set of papers was retrieved from Altmetric.com including some altmetric data. We identified 16 different social media sources from which Altmetric.com retrieves data. However five of them cover 95.5% of the total set. Twitter (87.1%) and Mendeley (64.8%) have the highest coverage. We conclude that Altmetric.com is a transparent, rich and accurate tool for altmetric data. Nevertheless, there are still potential limitations on its exhaustiveness as well as on the selection of social media sources that need further research.

AB We analyzed a discrete sample of the most frequent contributors to the journal El professional information (EPI) for the period 2009-2013. We studied the presence of these authors in social networks and the impact of their EPI publications indexed in Web of Science using different altmetrics. The results showed that 77% had a public profile on Google Scholar Profiles and 70% had an account on both Linkedln and Mendeley. This platform has served as the tool with higher statistics and obtained the highest correlation with the number of citations in Web of Science (0.516). Other networks were Twitter (55%) and Slideshare (47%); despite its lower presence in the sample, Slideshare offers users higher visibility, receiving the highest number of user hits. We also present detailed altmetrics for 47 EPI authors, ending with a reflection on the difficulty of analysing altmetrics at author level.

AB In this study we examined a sample of 100 European astrophysicists and their publications indexed by the citation database Scopus, submitted to the arXiv repository and bookmarked by readers in the reference manager Mendeley. Although it is believed that astrophysicists use arXiv widely and extensively, the results show that on average more items are indexed by Scopus than submitted to arXiv. A considerable proportion of the items indexed by Scopus appear also on Mendeley, but on average the number of readers who bookmarked the item on Mendeley is much lower than the number of citations reported in Scopus. The comparisons between the data sources were done based on the authors and the titles of the publications.

AB Today, destination-marketing organizations and researchers are increasingly focusing their attention on travel blogs and reviews due to their potential for projecting the image of a specific destination and for influencing travel behavior and decision making. However, the criteria used to select the Web sites hosting travel blogs and reviews for study are unclear, and very few quantitative or demographic studies about users (bloggers and readers) have been conducted. The aim of this study is to propose a method in which a webometric analysis is used to select the most suitable Web sites for a specific case study and to obtain information about users. The proposed webometric analysis consists of an integrated formula including visibility, popularity, and size metrics. This method was used to rank 11 suitable Web sites for studying the case of Catalonia.

On the one hand, we examine how long it takes before the articles' downloads reach 50 %/80 % of the total; on the other hand, we compare the percentage of total downloads in 7, 30, and 100 days after publication. In general, papers are downloaded most frequently within a short time period right after their publication. And we find that compared with non-Open Access papers, readers' attention on Open Access publications are more enduring. Based on the usage data of a newly published paper, regression analysis could predict the future expected total usage counts.

DT Article
DE Altmetrics; Indicators; Webometrics
ID IMPACT; CITATIONS; SCIENCE; REASONS
AB The rise of the social web and its uptake by scholars has led to the creation of altmetrics, which are social web metrics for academic publications. These new metrics can, in theory, be used in an evaluative role, to give early estimates of the impact of publications or to give estimates of non-traditional types of impact. They can also be used as an information seeking aid: to help draw a digital library user's attention to papers that have attracted social web mentions. If altmetrics are to be trusted then they must be evaluated to see if the claims made about them are reasonable. Drawing upon previous citation analysis debates and web citation analysis research, this article discusses altmetric evaluation strategies, including correlation tests, content analyses, interviews and pragmatic analyses. It recommends that a range of methods are needed for altmetric evaluations, that the methods should focus on identifying the relative strengths of influences on altmetric creation, and that such evaluations should be prioritised in a logical order.

ID CITATIONS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the tweeting behavior of 37 astrophysicists on Twitter and compares their tweeting behavior with their publication behavior and citation impact to show whether they tweet research-related topics or not.
   Design/methodology/approach - Astrophysicists on Twitter are selected to compare their tweets with their publications from Web of Science. Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication frequency.
   Findings - A moderate negative correlation (rho- -0.339) is found between the number of publications and tweets per day, while retweet and citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and abstracts is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting behavior such as retweeting and including hashtags, usernames and URLs.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is limited in terms of the small set of astrophysicists. Results are not necessarily representative of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter and they most certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should apply the methods to a larger set of researchers and other scientific disciplines.
   Practical implications - To a certain extent, this study helps to understand how researchers use Twitter. The results hint at the fact that impact on Twitter can neither be equated with nor replace traditional research impact metrics. However, tweets and other so-called altmetrics might be able to reflect other impact of scientists such as public outreach and science communication.
   Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, this is the first in-depth study comparing researchers' tweeting activity and behavior with scientific publication output in terms of quantity, content and impact.

TI Correlation and Interaction Visualization of Altmetric Indicators

   Structure

ID PATTERNS
AB Background: Citation counts for peer-reviewed articles and the impact factor of journals have long been indicators of article importance or quality. In the Web 2.0 era, growing numbers of scholars are using scholarly social network tools to communicate scientific ideas with colleagues, thereby making traditional indicators less sufficient, immediate, and comprehensive. In these new situations, the altmetric indicators offer alternative measures that reflect the multidimensional nature of scholarly impact in an immediate, open, and individualized way. In this direction of research, some studies have demonstrated the correlation between altmetrics and traditional metrics with different samples. However, up to now, there has been relatively little research done on the dimension and interaction structure of altmetrics.
   Objective: Our goal was to reveal the number of dimensions that altmetric indicators should be divided into and the structure in which altmetric indicators interact with each other.
   Methods: Because an article-level metrics dataset is collected from scholarly social media and open access platforms, it is one of the most robust samples available to study altmetric indicators. Therefore, we downloaded a large dataset containing activity data in 20 types of metrics present in 33,128 academic articles from the application programming interface website. First, we analyzed the correlation among altmetric indicators using Spearman rank correlation. Second, we visualized the multiple correlation coefficient matrixes with graduated colors. Third, inputting the correlation matrix, we drew an MDS diagram to demonstrate the dimension for altmetric indicators. For correlation structure, we used a social network map to represent the social relationships and the strength of relations.
   Results: We found that the distribution of altmetric indicators is significantly non-normal and positively skewed. The distribution of downloads and page views follows the Pareto law. Moreover, we found that the Spearman coefficients from 91.58% of the pairs of variables indicate statistical significance at the .01 level. The non-metric MDS map divided the 20 altmetric indicators into three clusters: traditional metrics, active altmetrics, and inactive altmetrics. The social network diagram showed two subgroups that are tied to each other but not to other groups, thus indicating an intersection between altmetrics and traditional metric indicators.
   Conclusions: Altmetrics complement, and most correlate significantly with, traditional measures. Therefore, in future evaluations of the social impact of articles, we should consider not only traditional metrics but also active altmetrics. There may also be a transfer phenomenon for the social impact of academic articles. The impact transfer path has transfer, or intermediate, stations that transport and accelerate article social impact from active altmetrics to traditional metrics and vice versa. This discovery will be helpful to explain the impact transfer mechanism of articles in the Web 2.0 era. Hence, altmetrics are in fact superior to traditional filters for assessing scholarly impact in multiple dimensions and in terms of social structure.

AB Faculty of 1000 (F1000) is a post-publishing peer review web site where experts evaluate and rate biomedical publications. F1000 reviewers also assign labels to each paper from a standard list or article types. This research examines the relationship between article types, citation counts and F1000 article factors (FFa). For this purpose, a random sample of F1000 medical articles from the years 2007 and 2008 were studied. In seven out of the nine cases, there were no significant differences between the article types in terms of citation counts and FFa scores. Nevertheless, citation counts and FFa scores were significantly different for two article types: "New finding" and "Changes clinical practice": FFa scores value the appropriateness of medical research for clinical practice and "New finding" articles are more highly cited. It seems that highlighting key features of medical articles alongside ratings by Faculty members of F1000 could help to reveal the hidden value of some medical papers.

AB In this paper we review the so-called altmetrics or alternative metrics. This concept raises from the development of new indicators based on Web 2.0, for the evaluation of the research and academic activity. The basic assumption is that variables such as mentions in blogs, number of twits or of researchers bookmarking a research paper for instance, may be legitimate indicators for measuring the use and impact of scientific publications. In this sense, these indicators are currently the focus of the bibliometric community and are being discussed and debated. We describe the main platforms and indicators and we analyze as a sample the Spanish research output in Communication Studies. Comparing traditional indicators such as citations with these new indicators. The results show that the most cited papers are also the ones with a highest impact according to the altmetrics. We conclude pointing out the main shortcomings these metrics present and the role they may play when measuring the research impact through 2.0 platforms.

AB We used existing and customized bibliometric and scientometric methods to analyze publication trends in neuroimaging research of minimally conscious states and describe the domain in terms of its geographic, contributor, and content features. We considered publication rates for the years 2002-2011, author interconnections, the rate at which new authors are added, and the domains that informthe work of author contributors. We also provided a content analysis of clinical and ethical themes within the relevant literature. We found a 27% growth in the number of papers over the period of study, professional diversity among a wide range of peripheral author contributors but only few authors who dominate the field, and few new technical paradigms and clinical themes that would fundamentally expand the landscape. The results inform both the science of consciousness as well as parallel ethics and policy studies of the potential for translational challenges of neuroimaging in research and health care of people with disordered states of consciousness.

AB Social media now complements many parts of our lives. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and many other social networking sites allow users to share and interact with online content and to connect with like-minded people. Its strengths - rapid dissemination and amplification of content and the ability to lead informal conversations - make it a powerful tool to use in a professional context. This commentary explains the overall concept of social media and offers suggestions on usage and possible types of scientific content. It advises researchers on the potential benefits and how to take a strategic approach towards building a social media presence. It also presents examples of effective social media use within the plant science community. Common reasons for scientists to not engage with social media include the fear of appearing unprofessional, posting something wrong or being misunderstood, or a lack of confidence in their computer skills. With the rapid changes in academic publishing, dissemination and science communication, as well as the rise of 'altmetrics' to track online engagement with scientific content, digital literacy will become an essential skill in a scientist's tool kit.

ID CITATION ANALYSIS; IMPACT; METRICS; SCIENCE; LEVEL
AB Altmetric measurements derived from the social web are increasingly advocated and used as early indicators of article impact and usefulness. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic scientific evidence that altmetrics are valid proxies of either impact or utility although a few case studies have reported medium correlations between specific altmetrics and citation rates for individual journals or fields. To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles. Finally, the coverage of all the altmetrics except for Twitter seems to be low and so it is not clear if they are prevalent enough to be useful in practice.

By monitoring the downloads of scientific articles in the journal of Scientometrics for 744 h, namely one month, we investigate the download statistics. Then we aggregate the keywords in these downloaded research papers, and analyze the trends of article downloading and keyword downloading. Furthermore, taking both the downloads of keywords and articles into consideration, we design a method to detect the emerging research trends. We find that in scientometrics field, social media, new indices to quantify scientific productivity (g-index), webometrics, semantic, text mining, and open access are emerging fields that scientometrics researchers are focusing on.

AB Scholarly content is increasingly being discussed, shared, and bookmarked online by researchers. Altmetric is a start-up that focuses on tracking, collecting, and measuring this activity on behalf of publishers; here we describe our approach and general philosophy. Over the past year we have seen sharing and discussion activity around approximately 750,000 articles. The average number of articles shared each day grows by 5-10% a month. We look at examples of how people are interacting with papers online and at how publishers can collect and present the resulting data to deliver real value to their authors and readers.
